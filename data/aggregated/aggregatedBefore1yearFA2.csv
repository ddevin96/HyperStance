However, the warming was, once again, minimal and relatively local compared to current global warming trends. For example, the Northwestern Americas, the pacific, and Asia were considerably colder than the 1961-1990 average.

More specifically the force transferred via the infrared energy into the physical object results in a movement force within that object - in this case the air. So the more energy that goes in the more movement that there is. The increased movement results in increased pressure within a closed system - that's how a steam turbine works. In atmospheric terms (an open system) when there is heat going in the pressure decreases. When the heat is not going in the air moves in from the denser (higher pressure) cold areas. Increasing the pressure in a closed system - compression - will not increase the temperature as there is no transfer of force into the system - no movement of energy. ,against

But this isn't telling the whole story. A blog post that cites scientific literature explains this pretty accurately. To quote the blog, "" In the case of warming, the lag between temperature and CO2 is explained as follows: as ocean temperatures rise, oceans releaseCO2 into the atmosphere. In turn, this release amplifies the warming trend, leading to yet more CO2 being released. In other words, increasing CO2 levels become both the cause and effect of further warming. This positive feedback is necessary to trigger the shifts between glacials and interglacials as the effect of orbital changes is too weak to cause such variation. Additional positive feedbacks which play an important role in this process include other greenhouse gases, and changes in ice sheet cover and vegetation patterns.""  ""A 2012 study by Shakun et al. looked at temperature changes 20,000 years ago (the last glacial-interglacial transition) from around the world and added more detail to our understanding of the CO2-temperature change relationship.  They found that:  The Earth's orbital cycles triggered warming in the Arctic approximately 19,000 years ago, causing large amounts of ice to melt, flooding the oceans with fresh water. This influx of fresh water then disrupted ocean current circulation, in turn causing a seesawing ofheat between the hemispheres.The Southern Hemisphere and its oceans warmed first, starting about 18,000 years ago.  As the Southern Ocean warms, the solubility of CO2 in water falls.  This causes the oceans to give up more CO2, releasing it into the atmosphere.  While the orbital cycles triggered the initial warming, overall, more than 90% of the glacial-interglacial warming occured after that atmospheric CO2 increase.""

Using the word 'exacerbate' in this context struck me as a strange choice.  &gt; [CO2] contributed to most of the warming.   How can you quantify the effect of CO2 when other factors contributed to and may have been dominant in causing the abrupt collapse of the last glacial episode? CO2's effect on temperature is logarithmic, most of the available energy at the 4.3 and 15 micron wavelenghts was already being absorbed at 180 ppm CO2 that prevailed during the last glaciation.

To paraphrase my comment, the earth's orbital cycles caused warming, which triggered rising sea levels, which released carbon dioxide. According to Shakun et al. (2012), the CO2 released contributed to 90 percent of the warming during the last transition from the glacial to the most recent interglacial period.  &gt;Its of no use to me  How do you know? And if you don't believe it, just pay it or read the quotes I cited. You can't excuse your lack of willingness to read a study just because it's behind a paywall. Did you even read the abstract? You should probably have a subscription to a scientific journal like nature, considering the fact that you've been debating climate change on reddit for over a year now. But that doesn't even matter, as most of my statements are supported by the abstract, which you can view for free: ""The covariation of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and temperature in Antarctic ice-core records suggests a close link between CO2 and climate during the Pleistocene ice ages. The role and relative importance of CO2 in producing these climate changes remains unclear, however, in part because the ice-core deuterium record reflects local rather than global temperature. Here we construct a record of global surface temperature from 80 proxy records and show that temperature is correlated with and generally lags CO2 during the last (that is, the most recent) deglaciation. Differences between the respective temperature changes of the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere parallel variations in the strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation recorded in marine sediments. These observations, together with transient global climate model simulations, support the conclusion that an antiphased hemispheric temperature response to ocean circulation changes superimposed on globally in-phase warming driven by increasing CO2concentrations is an explanation for much of the temperature change at the end of the most recent ice age."" As you can see, even the abstract supports my claim that the climate change lag is explained without jumping to the conclusion that CO2 doesn't affect temperature.  &gt;You again mention the Permian period You again mention the Permian period a quarter billion years ago but it has no relevance here because the Earth's atmospheric chemistry, tectonic activity and geographical land mass distribution was radically different from our current Holocene epoch.  Once again, according to the numerous scientific papers I have cited, other factors do not matter, as the main driver was shown to be CO2. If CO2 was shown to be a major driver in the past, why would that change? What change can you point out would cause the effect of CO2 to change? And even if we only look at recent events, the correlation between CO2 and global climate is still very prominent.   &gt;The Wisconsin glaciation ended about 17,000 years ago and warming was more likely accelerated by the reduction of the Earth's albedo as the ice-sheet extent decreased, CO2 levels reached interglacial levels 5,000 years later.  Yes, but once again, considering the scientific papers I have cited, such as Shakun et al. (2012), these changes only initiated the release of CO2, which, according to the same study, contributed 90 percent to the warming after the most recent glaciatial period 17,000 years ago. I never denied that other events contributed to the end of the Wisconsin glaciation, but according to the scientific literature I must have cited 10 times now, the main driver of the end of the Wisconsin glaciation was CO2. If you have any peer reviewed studies disagreeing, and demonstrating that the reduction of the earth's albedo was what caused the end of that glaciation period, then please send it to me in your next response so that we can clear this up.   &gt;CO2 levels reached interglacial levels 5,000 years later.  Do you have a source for this claim? Because the source that I cited disagrees. And even if this is true, that doesn't mean that the sharp rise of carbon dioxide at the end of the Wisconsin Glacial period did not contribute to most of the temperature increase 17,000 years ago. Or maybe the process was just several thousand years long.  Once again, I'll quote skeptical science, since they explained it much better than I possibly can in the next comment, as the article is quite long.

mattm2714,2018-04-03 10:02:34,dwpwt4h,891qyt,dwpvft8,climateskeptics,"Unfortunately Its too long, and I don't want to chop it up, nor am I knowledgable enough to summarize it. So here's another answer I found that I think does a good job of explaining this: ""The claim that ""... the effectiveness of CO2 as a greenhouse gas diminishes logarithmically with increasing concentration and from the current level of ~390 ppmv, ..."" and that ""inconvenient fact"" is ""well disguised for any lay reader"" is one of the more ridiculous climate skeptic claims I've seen. The main metric used by climate scientists to describe the effect of carbon dioxide is called ""climate sensitivity"". Equilibrium climate sensitivity is the amount of warming we expect to see resulting from a doubling of atmospheric CO2. This directly tells you (provided you understand logarithms) that there is a logarithmic relationship between carbon dioxide concentrations. If ECS is 2°C per doubling that means if we raise CO2 from the pre-industrial equilibrium concentration (i.e. up to 560ppm from 280ppm) then we would expect to see a 2°C temperature rise once the climate system had fully re-equilibriated. However to get the next 2°C rise, you would need to double the atmospheric CO2 again (i.e. up to 1120 ppm) and to get a third 2°C increase you would need to double it again, up to 2240ppm.  Note that log2(280) = 8.1293, log2(560) = 9.1293, log2(1120) = 10.1293 and log2(2240) = 11.1293, so if we have y=c*log2(x), each time we double x, y increased by c, which is why expressing climate sensitivity in °C per doubling is just saying that the relationship is logarithmic in a way that ought to be clear even to someone who doesn't know what a logarithm is. The constant c in this equation is ECS, if you use a log to a different base (e.g. ln or log10) then the numeric value of c will be different, but the relationship is the same, it is just easier to explain in terms of log2. This is hardly rocket science!  Clearly, there is a ""diminishing returns"" effect here, but (i) far from hiding it, the climatologists are explicitly pointing it out in a form more easily understood even than logarithms (ii) to get a 2°C rise, you would only need to double CO2 levels from the pre-industrial level of 280ppm, and we have raised it to 400ppm already, so this is far from impossible, given that estimates of ECS are around 1.5-4.5°C per doubling.  ""there is high confidence that ECS is extremely unlikely less than 1°C and medium confidence that the ECS is likely between 1.5°C and 4.5°C and very unlikely greater than 6°C."" IPCC AR5 WG1, page 924 Do a google scholar search for ""climate sensitivity"", or look for it in the index of the IPCC reports and read the relevent sections, far from being hushed up, climatologists talk about this a lot.  Now of course the greenhouse effect is self-limiting, for a start for that not to be the case we would require the Sun's luminosity to be infinite (as CO2 affects the Earth's radiative balance, but ultimately the energy comes from the sun), or equivalently to allow an infinite timescale (which isn't possible either). The Stefan-Boltzman law that says the power radiated per unit area rises with the fourth power of temperature is also a strongly limiting factor (but that doesn't rule out temperatures being very high due to the greenhouse effect, e.g. Venus, so that isn't much consolation ;o).  In short, a logarithmic relationship does not rule out a 2°C rise in global mean surface temperatures, double atmospheric CO2 concentrations a sufficient number of times and it will happen (once the radiative balance is restored, which doesn't happen immediately). How many doublings this requires depends on the equilibrium climate sensitivity, and according to current scientific understanding (as articulated by the IPCC AR5 WG1 report) the answer is most likely one doubling (as the most probable value is a little over 2°C per doubling), but it could be less but it is very unlikely that the number is two or more doublings (as ECS below 1°C has been essentially ruled out).""

Your first one is that other theories were wrong in the past. However, this is an extremely naive and unscientific way of looking at the history of science. Theories aren't debunked all that often, rather they're added on to and edited by new research. For example, Newtonian physics was added on to by Einsteinian physics. Darwin's theory of evolution being gene centric was added on to, as new research demonstrated the important of epigenetics in evolution. Earlier theories of evolution were perfected and explained by Darwin. But even if all these scientific theories and models were outright debunked, that isn't in any way evidence that humans aren't contributing to climate change. Neither does consensus prove that humans are.   Your next claim is that there are other causes to climate change, and that's certainly true. There are many other causes, like the sun, the earths orbit, and other greenhouse gases, like methane and water vapor. Two things on this. First of all, just because there are other causes does not mean that CO2 isn't the main cause of the recent warming we've experienced over the past 150 years or so. In the past 140 years, we've seen a 4p percent increase in CO2 levels in the atmosphere, due to human activity (Evan's 2006, Harries 2001). How do we know such CO2 increases are the main cause of the current warming trend? Well, research of course. According to numerous scientific studies (Meehl et al. 2004, Tett et al. 2000, Stone et al. 2007, Lean and Rind 2008, Hubber and Knutti 2011, and Gillett et al. 2012), current warming trends are in fact due to CO2 rises, which they all agree is caused by the recent output of CO2 that has started since the industrial revolution in the 19th century. So now we know that humans released a huge amount of CO2 into the atmosphere, and this is causing the current warming trend, according to the available scientific literature. Please feel free to cite your own scientific literature, or to criticize my interpretation of these studies.  Your next claim is that during past ice ages and warming periods, CO2 was much higher than it is today. That's actually not true, and you've cited no source in support of this spurious claim. So I'll get one for you. According to NASA, in 2013, CO2 levels passed 440 PPM in the first time in recorded history.

Warming is so general that I really can't know what you're talking about. But past warming, like the warming 251.9 million years ago during the end of the Permian era, was catastrophic and wiped out most of life on earth. In fact, this warming was actually caused by CO2 (Grasby et al. 2011. Link: https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo1069). If we take into account previous warming events, that actually makes the case for CO2 causing climate change, not the other way around.   &gt;The ice has already melted many times, thus the plant-matter found under the ice. Response: This is different.  Who said its different? Gulick et al. (2017) has already established that in the past, the antarctic ice melted greatly, even more than today. The difference between these events and now is that now, we have millions, if not billions of people living on areas susceptible to rising sea levels. Entire islands have been swallowed up by rising sea levels, and several other island nations, like the Maldives, are planning evacuations for when their islands are completely submerged. Zwally et al. 2015 established that there is a net loss of sea ice, not a net gain. According to that same study, earth is experiencing a net loss of 187 cubic kilometers of ice per year.   &gt;The PPM was way higher in the past and no dooms-day came. Response: This is different.

The last one goes over historical CO2 in the Vostok ice core, and the second one goes over CO2 levels from Taylor dome ice core. The first link just lead to took me to a German website, but unfortunately that file did not exist, so I decided to do some of my own research on historic antarctic temperature. According to Petit et al. (1999), antarctic historic surface temperatures actually match up well with CO2 levels. Furthermore, according to Shindell et al. (2009), there is a great amount of warming occurring in Antarctica. They said that they couldn't pin down the cause of this warming, but Shindell also found that the current warming trend in Antarctica is consistent with the influence of fossil fuels. Zwelly et al. (2015) established that there is a net loss of ice. Overall, I couldn't find much data on previous climate, but I did find something about ice melting in the past. Parrenin et al. (2013) found that previous warming cycles were strongly influenced by the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. This shows that CO2, at least in the case of Antarctica, isn't some nothing gas that doesn't contribute to the climate at all. It shows the strong influence CO2 has on climate.  As for the medieval warm period, I did find some research on that. According to Mosberg et al. (2005), European climate during the medieval warm period was actually much cooler than it is now. Furthermore, according to Mann et al. (2009), the climate change wasn't nearly as drastic as it is now, and there were plenty of places that were characterized by colder temperature, not an increase in temperature. Here's what climate change looked like in the medieval warm period: https://skepticalscience.com/images/Temperature_Pattern_MWP.gif Here's what it looked like from 1999 to 2008: https://skepticalscience.com/images/Temp_Pattern_1999_2008_NOAA.jpg  In conclusion, according to the scientific literature, the medieval warm period was warmer than the present in some areas, but colder in others, Antarctica's historic climate was greatly influenced by CO2, Antarctica is shrinking, there is a net loss of ice every year, and the climate change during the medieval warm period in incomparable to the current warming trend.",against

According to Hugo, most of today's global warming data comes from research by Walter L. Sasser in 1942 on the Infrared Heat Balance of the Earth, which was commissioned by the US Weather Service and described by Hugo as ""brilliant work"".  Despite Sasser's brilliance, Mark Hugo describes shortcuts that were taken in the mathematical model to calculate infrared heat absorption and dissipation by the Earth, including a failure by past researchers to model the Earth as a globe, rather than the infinite flat-planar surface they used at the time. While Hugo claims the current model is approximately correct, the flaws in the model itself lead to an overabundance of stored heat used by global warming proponents to promote the idea that the Earth is heating up.  According to Hugo, a Russian nuclear physicist named Mikowski has provided a more detailed analysis of the infrared heat balance of the Earth, and his research does not indicate a net increase in heat that would create a global warming effect. To date, the model has met with resistance by atmospheric physicists who feel confident in the science involved with global warming and global climate change, but Hugo suggests that they are relying on scientific models that are outdated and may be proven incorrect over time.",against

mattm2714,2018-04-05 12:29:57,dwug0ig,89siwg,89siwg,climateskeptics,"Oh look, another false claim birthed from the climate science critical blogosphere.  The first citation is from Polovodova et al. (2018). Two things on this. First of all, the graph they champion as evidence that current warming patterns aren't bad compared to historic warming is only an analysis of the climate of continental Europe, not of global climate. So what does the research actually have to say about historic global climate? Well, quite the opposite. According to this graph (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/file/2558) constructed based on numerous studies, current climate is actually on par, if not more extreme than past warming, not to mention how abrupt modern warming actually is.  Next, they cite a source claiming that South African warming is perfectly normal. The article on your newswire failed to point out where this study actually claimed that. They next cite McGowan et al. 2018 as evidence that the same is true in Australia. Apparently, no one ever bothered to read even the abstract of the article. ""The current rate of warming is unmatched for the past 2000 years and seasonal snow cover is at a minimum"" says the study right in the abstract. Furthermore, they say the same later in the study. ""Our record suggests the Australian snowpack is now at a 2,000 year low, while reconstructed alpine Tmax temperatures are beginning to approach Tmax values around the height of the RWP at 150 BCE and MCA 1390 CE. Observed annual Tmax values are only now exceeding our reconstructed Tmax for the past 2000 years. The rate of temperature increase from 1970 to 2005 was approximately 2.6 times faster than the fastest rate of warming during the MCA."" So this study actually proves warming in the area it studies. As for Hanna et al., (2018), it is behind a paywall. This would be fine if they just quoted the study, however they don't at all, they just assert that it shows no climate change in Northern Alaska. As for Li et al., 2018, they just reconstruct temperature during the summer in Tibet. They even call the current period (1970-2008) relative warm periods in the summer in Tibet. But that doesn't mean they were saying both warming periods are the same. They even go on to say: ""Our reconstruction exhibits an overall increasing temperature trend since the 1960s, providing new evidence supporting the recent warming of the TP.""  As for Song et al. 2018, the study actually says this about human contribution to climate change: ""The impact of human activity on the climate began at approximately 1297 cal yr BP and became pronounced starting in 425 cal yr BP."" However, the same study does say ""The climate was relatively warm between 6842 and 1297 cal yr BP, followed by a relatively cold period."" I'm more than willing to accept these conclusions.  As for Mikis 2018, the study says in the abstract that ""The West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) experienced a ~3.4°C warming during the 20th century which was accompanied by widespread glacial melting."" However, the next statement goes on to say that there has been a decreasing trend. That still isn't incompatible with climate change. According to Zwally et al. (2015), Antarctica is gaining ice. This is well known and is not disputed. However, the arctic is actually losing ice much faster than the antarctic is gaining, so there is a net loss every year. They next cite Westergaard-Nielsen et al., 2018 as evidence that Greenland is cooling. However, the same study said this: ""Temperature changes in the Arctic have notable impacts on ecosystem structure and functioning, on soil carbon dynamics, and on the stability of permafrost, thus affecting ecosystem functions and putting man-built infrastructure at risk. Future warming in the Arctic could accelerate important feedbacks in permafrost degradation processes. Therefore it is important to map vulnerable areas most likely to be impacted by temperature changes and at higher risk of degradation, particularly near communities, to assist adaptation to climate change."" The same study also said ""Only a fraction of the ice-free Greenland seems vulnerable due to warming when analyzing year 2001–2015, but the most pronounced changes are found in the most populated parts of Greenland. As Greenland represents important gradients of north/south coast/inland/distance to large ice sheets, the conclusions are also relevant in an upscaling to greater Arctic areas."" So to just claim this study is saying that Greenland is just getting cooler isn't telling the whole story.

That is specifically addressed in the article under criterion #4. The answer is: it's both, because that's how feedback cycles work.  But I'm glad you brought it up.  Let's assume that the increased CO2 in the atmosphere is a *result* of the warming. If that were the case, would we expect to notice a corresponding change in atmospheric oxygen?   It turns out, we have [noticed exactly that](http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2012/03/14/3452867.htm). If atmospheric O2 is combined with the carbon in the fossil fuels pumped out of the ground (combustion), you create a CO2 molecule and remove one O2 molecule. CO2 that's directly outgassed from the ocean won't react with anything else in the atmosphere (until it's eventually absorbed by a plant).  Furthermore, old carbon buried deep in the crust as a different isotope ratio than ""fresh"" carbon in the carbon cycle, and the changing ratio of isotopes in the atmosphere points to an increasing amount of ""old"" carbon entering the carbon cycle that wasn't there previously.  Furthermore again: if CO2 were a *result* of warming, why do we have [a nice steady increase of CO2](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/full.html) (the output) given such a messy input (global temperature)?

Climate change is the most politicized topic by some measures. It's not surprising that the amount of poop flinging that goes on in political discussions is most intense around climate change.   &gt;I have lived long enough to have many of the things that we knew for sure turn out to be false so I am at least a bit skeptical.  This is a crucial lesson. There's a redditor with whom I've had several lengthy discussions who wants me to be as alarmed as he is. I keep telling him that I've watched a lot of scary projections come and go and think we, as a species, have a tendency toward overestimating danger. It makes a lot of sense from an evolutionary biology perspective. As I recently said, that rustle in the grass is probably just the wind, but it's a lot safer to assume it's a lion that wants to have you for dinner, and not in the congenial way.  &gt;It seems that there is no doubt that the temperature seems to be getting warmer overall however and I am not smart enough to know why.  Ah, don't sell yourself short. It's perfectly acceptable to notice that a system is incredibly complex and state that such a complex system won't be well understood for a very long time while still understanding the broad strokes of that system.   Regarding climate, I happen to be a lukewarmer, because that is where the evidence took me. Has there been warming? Sure. Is some of that due to mankind? Absolutely! Has all of it been due to mankind? Clearly not, as evidenced by the warming period from ~1905-1940. Do we need to know how much warming was caused by man to create good policy? No.  &gt;they still say that we would only affect the outcome by a fraction of a degree.  Right, and even that is built on a tower of assumptions.   &gt;Might be better spending money researching things that will have a substantial affect.  100% agree. Personally, I think the present approach is all wrong. Countries want to apply short-term fixes over long time frames. For example, they want to subsidize diffuse, intermittent energy sources to show they've reduced CO2 emissions per capita by a percentage point or two over a decade. It's pure insanity. Far better, in my opinion, to put those resources toward research and development of energy sources that can actually produce energy more cheaply than fossil fuels. At that point, there's no need to fly bureaucrats around the world every year to make promises that no one keeps. Pure economics would drive a far more rapid transition in the long term. We aren't too good at thinking long term, though.   &gt;Another beef that I have is that it seems to me that there is one clear path to combat the problem that uses existing technology and that is nuclear power.  Yep. I again agree. I'm very pro-nuclear power, and I think that any climate activist that isn't is either a misanthrope or really, really bad at math and science.   &gt;The climate warriors say that it is too dangerous but if they truly believe that the apocalypse is nigh, wouldn't it be worth the risk?  Exactly. I have yet to have one explain to me how climate change can supposedly be such a serious risk while at the same time not be so risky that all options aren't on the table. I've said before and will continue to say that the anti-nuclear climate activists have scored more own goals and created far more doubt in their cause than any oil or coal interest every has or will.  &gt;but shouting people down and insulting their intelligence rarely makes for a more enlightened opponent.  I agree, even though I must acknowledge that I've insulted someone here earlier this evening. That's a long story.

He uses a chart that was used commonly by Christopher Monckton a few years ago as evidence that CO2 has never driven climate, and that there is no correlation between the two. The graph was created by combining a chart of past CO2 and past temperatures. They come from two scientific studies, one published by Robert A Berner showing historic CO2 levels, and one published by Christopher Scotese that shows historic climate. Problem is, he didn't actually read the paper by Berner he cites. The same paper actually says that there is a strong correlation between climate and CO2. The paper that he cites from Berner is ""Geocarb III: A revised model of atmospheric CO2 over Phanerozoic time"" -- R. Berner and Z. Kothavala, American Journal of Science, Feb 2001."" Here's what it has to say about climate and CO2: ""This means that over the long term there is indeed a correlation between CO2 and paleotemperature."" So apparently either Monckton or whoever created this chart didn't actually read the papers they cited, they just found two charts and combined them. Furthermore, other studies have found a clear correlation between CO2 levels and climate:  ""CO2 as a primary driver of Phanerozoic climate"" -- D. Royer et al, GSA Today, March 2004. The problem is that the graph haphazardly just puts together two different graphs without these graphs being adjusted at all, for things like other factors that drive climate, like the output of the sun. The graphs specifically designed to show correlation, like the one I cited, shows a clear correlation between CO2 and climate. This shows that Fleming's assertion that there is no correlation between CO2 and climate is false. I don't know how Fleming, a scientist, can be so ignorant of the data showing this correlation.

No scientist disputes that there is a greenhouse gas effect. What the tiny fraction of scientist-skeptics dispute is whether the greenhouse effect is -- or will be -- the DOMINANT effect in the climate, and whether other effects will amplify it or dampen it.  In other words: the only thing we are debating is ""how much CO2 is too much."" Some, who call themselves ""conservatives"" say that we should keep pumping air into the atmosphere until it is 100% clear that we have put ""too much"" in and then we'll deal with it. Whereas others, who are more like the dictionary definition of the word ""conservative"" say: ""Why don't we just leave our atmosphere as we found it, rather than waiting to see how much CO2 will ruin it...especially given that we have a lot of good reason for thinking that we're already close to ruining it?""  &gt; My beef has always been that even if we had done everything that Al Gore and the Paris Climate Accords and everything else everyone wants to do, they still say that we would only affect the outcome by a fraction of a degree.  You have to start somewhere.  &gt; If that is the case, I don't see where it makes sense to pour money down a drain when it may not have a practical affect.   I don't think anyone said it would not have any practical effect. They probably said it was just a start and we'd need to keep going. Also:  http://greenmonk.net/2010/01/07/what-if-we-create-a-better-world-for-nothing/  Shutting down coal plants literally saves lives directly (particulate matter) AND protects the oceans from acidificiation AND reduces climate change. The same is true for electric cars. California has the toughest emissions standards not to save the planet, but rather to save the lives of their own children who otherwise would be choking to death on pollution as they were in the 1970s. And it's still bad:  http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2016/08/10/southern-california-air-pollution-leads-to-thousands-of-avoidable-deaths-annually-study-says/  &gt;Might be better spending money researching things that will have a substantial affect.  The best way to motivate that research is to put a price on carbon. Anyhow, if we only did the things we already know how to do (shut down coal plants, ramp up electric cars, install solar) we would have TONS of benefits -- those changes would pay for themselves easily. But we're like a vehicle literally stuck in a rut on a road. It takes a push to get out of the rut and onto a better road. I'm personally willing to get out of the car and push it onto the better road for the sake of my children and eventual grandchildren, but some profit from being on the road we're on so they'll dig in their heels and push the vehicle back into the rut.  &gt; Another beef that I have is that it seems to me that there is one clear path to combat the problem that uses existing technology and that is nuclear power. The climate warriors say that it is too dangerous but if they truly believe that the apocalypse is nigh, wouldn't it be worth the risk?  Nuclear power should be used, and MANY climate warriors are VERY much in favour of it.  David Roberts -- one of the most prolific climate change writers: https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/4/5/17196676/nuclear-power-plants-climate-change-renewables  https://www.cnn.com/2013/11/03/world/nuclear-energy-climate-change-scientists/index.html  The title of that one is literally: ""Climate Change Warriors: It's time to go nuclear.""  Another heavy hitter: Eric Holthaus: https://grist.org/article/its-time-to-go-nuclear-in-the-fight-against-climate-change/  And James Hansen, one of the top 10 names in climate change: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/03/nuclear-power-paves-the-only-viable-path-forward-on-climate-change  Climate warriors are in favour of nuclear, but governments are not, in part because nobody wants one in their neighbourhood, in part because there are SOME environmentalists who oppose them, in part because of the very real risks (including nuclear weapons proliferation) and in part because they just don't have a super-great financial ROI compared to alternatives.

It's actually significantly more complex than that. Now you know that I acknowledge that CO2 is a GHG, that it's increased due to mankind, etc. However, there's also more to the solar story that rarely gets told. What we generally see is a lag between changes in solar activity and temperature. I have seen estimates of lag as low as one solar cycle and as high as, I think, something like 50 years. (I didn't bookmark the papers, unfortunately, so we'll just build on this premise for discussion, acknowledging that I haven't provided a source.)  Now of course the obvious question would be, what's the physical mechanism that causes this lag? I have read some speculative works that suggest atmospheric changes due to UV and/or magnetic flux. The argument I find more interesting is the one about how UV flux changes with strong solar cycles. UV penetrates ocean waters much further than other wavelengths of EM radiation, and we are discussing this in the context of a depleted ozone already. It makes sense to me that we haven't fully accounted for this, especially in GCMs that only use TSI to estimate solar influences. That's not to say that solar explains everything. Not by any means, but the decline in warming rate would be consistent with a solar plus GHG model where solar is now declining. ",against

Historically, climate has been influenced greatly by the sun. No one denies that. But recently, they've diverged, so we can't blame the sun for climate change. Krivova et al. (2007) shows a clear divergence between climate and solar irradiance that began in 1980, yet global temperatures continue to rise according to the same chart. Foster and Rahmstorf (2011) showed that solar activity between 1979 and 2010 actually had a net cooling effect, not a heating effect. Lean and Rind (2008) found that while solar activity can account for 11 percent of global warming between 1889 to 2006, but could only account for 1.6 percent of warming between 1955 and 2005.

Energy in must equal energy out for the planet to be in equilibrium and not accumulating more and more energy. In the real world the troposphere warms due to that increased ""heat trapping"" and emits more and more IR until energy in = energy out. At equilibrium for e.g. a CO2 doubling the amount of IR reaching the stratosphere would then be the same as in the original state.  Adding further realism, many greenhouse gases also absorb small amounts of SW radiation from the Sun. Water vapour is particularly important for this as it increases in response to warming. Also, ice melts in response to warming. These factors mean that less SW is reflected back to space than in the original state, so achieving equilibrium actually means there will be more upwelling IR than before. That's what climate models predict, but they also predict mid-upper stratospheric cooling alongside that IR upwelling increase.  I think if you added in IR wavelength bands you'd have part of an explanation. CO2 does not absorb all IR equally, it is especially absorbent in certain frequency bands. Even with a total increase in upwelling IR, the higher CO2 concentration could mean decreasing IR entering the mid-upper stratosphere in CO2's desired 15 micron band. Which could mean less IR absorption taking place in the upper stratosphere in particular.  There's another part though, which is that increased concentration of CO2 molecules apparently allows substantially increased chance of bumping into and ""stealing"" energy from other, probably N2, molecules in the rarefied air. Which they then emit, reducing the local temperature.",favor

As I said, it's one of several factors. Given how deep UV penetrates in ocean waters, I think its influence has been underestimated, especially as UV reaching the surface increased for 30 years and plateaued in the 90s: https://www.nasa.gov/topics/solarsystem/features/uv-exposure.html  We also see measurements of UV different drastically from expectations: https://www.nasa.gov/images/content/506268main_sorce4b.jpg  The main point I was driving at is that we don't have the climate figured out yet, especially the many ways solar activity influences climate.   &gt;In the real world the troposphere warms due to that increased ""heat trapping"" and emits more and more IR until energy in = energy out.   You are assuming a fixed input of visible light (which is actually not a bad assumption, given observed TSI variance) as well as UV, which is not a good assumption. Further, you are assuming a fixed opacity of the atmosphere to downwelling UV, but we know that's incorrect given depleted atmospheric ozone.   So while I agree that increased GHGs lead to warming, I'm suggesting there more to it than that.   &gt;Adding further realism...  You are trying to convince me of something I already accept.  &gt;Also, ice melts in response to warming.   Again, not relevant to what I'm saying. (Also, ice also melts in response to black carbon.)  &gt;CO2 does not absorb all IR equally, it is especially absorbent in certain frequency bands.  Once again, I agree with all of this.   So to summarize, we agree about GHGs being opaque to upwelling IR, and the more GHGs, the more opacity. What I'm suggesting is that solar influences have been underestimated, especially with a depleted ozone factored in, and that we won't get a complete picture of climate until we explore these things as well.

As can be seen, GHGs (primarily CO2) make little net difference to the lower stratosphere but cause a large negative trend in the upper stratosphere. Modeled all-forcing simulations reproduce very well the observed long-term trend in the upper stratosphere and the decadal variability, which is primarily due to the 11-year solar cycle, with some volcanic influence. Observations there end at 2005, but I've already posted the link with continuation to the present.

The link features a quote highlighting snowfall increase in the Antarctic Peninsula being about 10% since the 19th Century. [Here's the CMIP5 mean hindcast prediction](https://i1.wp.com/bonjourplanetearth.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/icmip5_pr_amon_modmean_rcp85_-82-50e_-78-60n_n_5lan__mean1_anom_30.png) for precipitation in the Antarctic Peninsula: A 10% increase from the 19th Century to early 21st Century.   - As a consequence of increased snowfall climate scientists have long predicted that Antarctic surface mass balance (SMB) change would have a small negative influence on sea level. The most recent IPCC report in 2013 predicted a *likely* range of about -1 to -6cm sea level change due to Antarctic SMB.   - That 2013 IPCC report was the first to also include an estimate of  predicted Antarctic mass change due to ""rapid dynamics"" - essentially mass changes due to morphological changes to the ice sheet, part of that being the increased snowfall accumulation. The *likely* uncertainty range for sea level influence spanned -1 to +16cm.   - After combining those factors, the *likely* range for sea level contribution from Antarctica came to about -5 to +13cm, best estimate at +5cm. That range was then incorporated in to the reported overall sea level prediction, with a *likely* range reaching up to about 1 metre under the highest emission scenario. So Antarctica is a small factor in that.   - The ""flaw"" in that estimate is that it did not include any allowance for identified potential for collapses in parts of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which would cause substantially greater rise. In other words, what they mean by 'those estimates have proven to be flawed' is that they substantially **underestimate** the upper bound and Antarctica could become the dominant contributor.  However, the IPCC were clear that theirs was a *likely* range (still allowing a hefty 17% chance of exceeding it) and they explicitly mentioned this potential source of greater rise of up to ""several tenths of a meter"".

As can be seen, the period from about 1400-1850CE typically associated with being ""The Little Ice Age"" is consistently a few tenths of a degree cooler than the millennium preceding it.  And that wasn't anything really new for 2013. [As shown by the IPCC](http://ipcc.ch/report/graphics/images/Assessment%20Reports/AR5%20-%20WG1/Chapter%2005/Fig5-07.jpg), Mann et al. 2008 produced a tentative global average which again indicates 1400-1850CE being consistently a few tenths cooler than the preceding millennium.

Climate models likewise simulate generally cooler temperatures during 1400-1850CE than 800-1250CE, by a few tenths of a degree. Due primarily to volcanic eruptions, but also with a significant solar contribution. Also a significant contribution from CO2, which dipped to a millennial low at around 1600, with a forcing change of about 0.15W/m2.

One example is that the air around Antarctica is currently often too cold to hold much moisture. Therefore precipitation (almost always as snowfall) is rare. Antarctica is technically classed as a desert due to this lack of precipitation.  Warming increases the ability of the air around Antarctica to take up moisture, but there isn't yet enough warming for it to fall as anything other than snow - we're a long way from that threshold.

Greenland will get colder (reversing the ice melt), Europe will get colder, so that snow and ice will fall sooner, last longer.  Winter will get longer.  Floating sea ice in the arctic will expand, reflecting more solar energy into space, preventing the sun from warming arctic waters.  Sounds like a strong negative feedback to me.  Lock up more humidity in snow and ice for longer each year, changing the albedo of the planet.

But climate scientists assumed that the ability to plants to perform this function was limited because the availability of nitrogen in the atmosphere was limited.  As a 2003 study published in the same Science journal put it, **""there will not be enough nitrogen available to sustain the high carbon uptake scenarios.""**  In the wake of the latest findings, Ronald Amundson, a soil biogeochemist at the University of California at Berkeley, told Chemical and Engineering News that **""If there is more nitrogen there than expected, then the constraints on plant growth in a high-CO2 world may not be as great as we think.""**  In other words, with more nitrogen available, plant life might be able to absorb more CO2 than climate scientists have been estimating, which means the planet won't warm as much, despite mankind's pumping CO2 into the atmosphere.  And now Scientists just discovered a massive, heretofore unknown, source of nitrogen. So much for all the claims based on ""settled science.""  The researchers, whose findings were published in the prestigious journal Science, say they've determined that the idea that the only source of nitrogen for plant life came from the air is wrong. There are vast storehouses in the planet's bedrock that plants also feed on.

skeeezoid,2018-04-17 17:50:59,dxijvnj,8cgy5h,dxexpd8,climateskeptics,"There's a good write-up of this issue [here](http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2015/11/so-what-is-really-happening-in-antarctica/).  There have been more than a dozen recent papers published concerning Antarctic mass balances. As shown on Figure 1 of that link, Zwally's (NASA) paper is quite an extreme outlier, with **all** other papers finding significant net mass loss in the past 10-15 years. You should probably ask yourself how it is you've apparently only heard of that one outlier paper.  As described in that link, the main issue is the assumptions Zwally's, and other papers using altimeter data, make to convert their ice sheet height changes into ice sheet mass changes. The key assumption relates to the cause of accumulation. Most papers using altimeter data have assumed zero background trend in accumulation, and therefore implicitly attribute observed accumulation to recent snowfall increase. Zwally instead assumes there has been a background Antarctic accumulation rate equivalent to about -0.5mm/yr sea level change over the past several thousand years due to continued adjustment to greater snowfall rates following deglaciation.  This difference affects modelling of density of the ice sheet and therefore how height changes translate to mass.  If Zwally is correct in his assumptions, in a sense both ""Antarctica is gaining mass"" and ""Satellites measure Antarctica losing land ice at an accelerating rate"" would be right. His net (gains-losses) result suggest mass accumulation over recent decades, but they also, in common with all other papers, show an acceleration in the losses column where those occur. It's just that the losses haven't (yet) accelerated enough to overcome his background accumulation rate.",favor

""The CO2 buildup is not made up of our CO2 emissions"" because natural emissions are 25 times higher.   Both are trivially wrong. I'm surprised they are posted here.   1. When GHGs absorb LW and heats molecules (as the writer agrees) that energy is emitted randomly both up and down which changes the net radiation entering the system. Change net radiation and the system compensates by heating up at the surface. Basic 19th century thermodynamics. Can't beat conservation of energy.  2. On an annual basis natural emissions are 25 times higher than those from fossil fuels. However, the natural component is not an addition to the atmosphere. As the writer says, the natural component is a ""flux"", part of the annual process of leaf growth (spring/summer) and decay (autumn/winter), mostly from the northern hemisphere forests. That carbon flux is nearly in balance each year, and over multiple years is in balance for all intents and purposes. By his figures, we add 1/25th of that total flux, or 4%. About half of that is absorbed by land and ocean sinks, however the rest accumulates. The additional 45% of CO2 in the atmosphere compared with pre-industrial times is from burning fossil fuels.

By that logic, every can of compressed aerosol in your house should be hot just sitting on the shelf. And Titan (with an atmospheric pressure ~1.5 times earth's) should be hotter than earth.   The ideal gas law can tell you how temperature will *change* with respect to pressure (all else being equal). If you take gas of a given temperature and compress it, it heats up. But then if you leave it alone, it reaches eventually reaches equilibrium (temperature drops back down, reducing the pressure somewhat, but still higher than its initial state when it was in a larger volume). That's why your areosol cans are room temperature; and if you discharge them quickly they get *colder* than room temperature, but they don't stay cold.  Venus is at its equilibrium state. It is hot because of energy from the sun; and the mostly CO2 atmosphere retains more of it compared to Mercury which radiates more away (per unit area). The pressure is important in that it concentrates much more CO2 into a given volume which increases the greenhouse effect.",against

The fringe deniers who claim CO2 isn't a greenhouse gas, the data is fake, it's-not-warming-but-the-warming-is-natural etc are not in positions to matter anymore.

Thud,2018-04-19 18:53:01,dxmtvws,8d15ko,dxmk1w0,climateskeptics,"You certainly have no shortage of insults, but yes... let's break this down.  &gt;My hypothesis: Atmospheric temperature is a function of net radiation, atmospheric pressure, and (to a far lesser extent) composition.  You're missing a bunch of stuff. Albedo? The planet's internal heat? And what determines pressure? That's a whole mess of equations! Maybe you should clarify that you're talking about *equilibrium* temperature. Maybe you can also specify what you mean by ""atmospheric temperature"" because a single atmosphere is a whole range of temperatures from the troposphere to the thermosphere. So let's assume you mean *lower tropospheric* temperature which is what you'd feel at the surface.  &gt;Your hypothesis: Atmospheric temperature is solely a function of composition.  Nope. I did not say that temperature is ""solely"" a function of composition. See previous statements.  You did, however, allude to something...    &gt;Atmospheric temperature is a function of **net radiation**  Bam! And what is net radiation? It's the difference between the incoming radiation (from the sun) and the outgoing radiation (from the planet back into space). In equilibrium, where the planet's temperature is not changing, the net radiation is ZERO (this is conservation of energy). You are correct that net radiation is a factor. This is key.  Now change any one of the other physical parameters that can affect temperature. Initially, the net radiation will be non-zero. If the planet is radiating more energy than it receives, it must therefore be cooling (conservation of energy). If the planet is radiating less energy than it receives, it must therefore be warming (conservation of energy).  (Note: for simplicity we are ignoring the negligible contribution to outgoing radiation from the planet's internal heat, because that is effectively constant)  It will continue to do so until it reaches a new equilibrium, with net 0 radiation; and the average surface temperature will either be higher or lower than what it was before.  In the case of Venus, the link I sent you earlier explained the feedbacks that caused CO2 to enter the atmosphere. So for a loooong time Venus would have been radiating less energy than it received, until it reached its current equilibrium point which is MUCH HOTTER than it was previously (conservation of energy).  So the net radiation is THE key. Now, figuring out what causes a change in net radiation is the real problem.  &gt;Proposition: Venus and Mars both have atmospheres that are almost entirely CO2. (96.5% for Venus, 95.97% for Mars.)   You are ignoring a critical aspect which you have yet to mention... which is **density**. The closer together you pack CO2, the better the odds of a given infrared wave to be absorbed by another molecule after being emitted from a previous one.  The actual thickness of the atmosphere is also important, as Mars' atmosphere starts off thin at the surface and disappears to almost nothing very quickly as you go up. So while Mars does have a greenhouse effect, it's like wrapping yourself in a thin sheet on a cold night vs. Venus which is like wrapping yourself in a thick, densely packed thermal blanket.  Earth is somewhere in the middle. The absolute density of CO2 is low in earth's atmosphere, but because it is a much thicker atmosphere, it increases the odds of re-radiation compared to Mars.  The CO2 greenhouse effect on Venus would only be negligible if CO2 absorbed radiation in a frequency that was something other than longwave infrared. But unfortunately that's how physics works - it ain't up to us. ",against

But yeah I'm with you so far, except it *does* matter what the gas is, particularly for longer wavelength radiation, because not all gases absorb the same frequency (we know this from spectroscopy).

They then conclude that this means the global average rise in atmospheric water vapor should be attributed to a natural trend towards El Nino, and not anthropogenic causation.  However, to sensibly draw such a conclusion they would have to check what is the expected spatial pattern of water vapor increase due to anthropogenic forcing, which they appear not to have done.  [Here are maps](http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/104/39/15248/F4.large.jpg) showing that pattern in CMIP3 models from [Santer et al. 2007](http://www.pnas.org/content/104/39/15248) (Map B is anthro-only, Map A anthro+natural forcing). You can see a particularly high rate of increase is expected around the equatorial Pacific. Which means anthropogenic forcing **can** explain that feature in the observations.  Furthermore, we can examine the claim that the water vapor pattern looks like an El Nino response. [These](http://images.remss.com/graphics/cdr/vapor/v07/r01/medium/global/month/vapor_anomaly/rss.mw.cdr_1997_12_month_vapor_anomaly_v7_r1.png) [maps](http://images.remss.com/graphics/cdr/vapor/v07/r01/medium/global/month/vapor_anomaly/rss.mw.cdr_2015_12_month_vapor_anomaly_v7_r1.png) show the water vapor patterns at the peak of the 1997/98 and 2015/16 El Ninos. We can see the strong positive pattern in the Eastern and Central Pacific, as in the long term trend. However, in the Western Pacific there is a weak, perhaps even negative water vapor response. This is very much contrary to the long-term pattern, which is slightly stronger in the Western Pacific. This is actually indicative of a tendency towards La Nina rather than El Nino.  The best fit for explaining the tropical Pacific long-term trend is a general strong increase across the equatorial Pacific due to anthropogenic forcing, with a slight negative ENSO trend. This is backed up by the fact that ENSO indicators (i.e. MEI, SOI) have negative trends over the 1988-2017 period of the water vapor data.",against

Reduce wasteful energy consumption, and we save on energy costs and reduce emissions.  But what is the impact of reducing needed energy usage?  What is it needed for?  Life thrives on energy, so it makes sense to continue usage that promotes that.  It makes sense to focus on areas where energy is detrimental to life.  For example, it takes a lot of energy to wage wars, but people prefer living in conditions of love and harmony.  So it makes sense to work on solving social/diplomatic problems and reduce wars.  Another way to reduce emissions is to switch technology.  For example, harnessing environmental motion via hydro-electric, wind, tides, etc.  Or converting solar light to electrical power with panels.  Each alternative has issues to consider, though.  For example, windmills harming birds.  Another way is to change what is emitted.  For example, solar reflectors and nuclear reactions can be used to turn water into steam to power generators, and steam is an alternate emission.  I think it makes sense that any alternative emits something that is good for life.  Steam cools, condenses, and precipitates into rain, which is good for life.  With coal-based generation, there is technology that filters particles and gases that are harmful to life, and so reducing their emissions to more pure CO2, which helps plants thrive.",favor

Using government mandate to try to force innovation stifles imagination because the government usually backs the wrong horse (see the Soviet Union). Trying to force innovation also misdirects resources, diminishing the wealth of society and the innovation inherent in wealthy societies.  Therefore treaties and government programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions reduce the overall wealth of society and its tendency to improve. If renewable energy was such a good thing, there would be no need for governments to impose it by making other forms of energy less palatable by law.

I can make a compelling argument that we need to continue down the path of moving away from fossil fuels, but not ""because CO2 is going to cause great harm by heating up the planet.""  We have been much higher in CO2 in the past, and much lower.  The CO2 concentration levels in the past have never preceded a rise in temperature, and we have evidence that temperatures have begun falling rapidly while CO2 levels are still climbing.    Temperature changes historically always precede CO2 level changes, with both rising and falling.  But! burning coal comes with increased SO2 levels, increased black soot, poisons in the water, fly ash to dispose of, and dangers in mining the material in the first place.  So, we should try to get out of the ""burning coal"" business.  After coal, oil has a lesser dramatic effect on the environment, but we still have particulates that we would rather not breath in, lots of complex nitrogen/oxygen compounds that are good to be avoided, etc.  We do use petroleum for other things, lubricants and the base for plastics, so we may need to figure out alternatives for some of those things if we want to reduce our petroleum use.    Natural gas is pretty darn clean to burn, and can be harvested from, well, nature.  It's a renewable resource and is really good at heating things.  I can foresee the use of natural gas for a long time to come.  We may change the way we obtain natural gas, but I don't see any compelling reason why we should just stop using it.  We have lots and lots of wind, plenty of sunshine, decent amounts of water movement, and ever more efficient ways to power things like electronics and motion.  So, it's easy to see that we may power most of the things we need to power in this world with renewable energy for electricity, natural gas for pure heating applications (like melting steel or glass, producing cement, etc.).   If you're purely worried about CO2 and the average temperature of the planet, remember that half of the reported temperature anomaly that is being shown today is due to adjustments, not actual measurements.  All of the disasterous predictions that have been made by Climate Scientists to date have been shown to be wrong.  Tuvalu is not yet underwater, the Maldives are growing and thriving, polar bears have higher populations now than they did in the 1970s or '80s, we still have ice in the Arctic all summer long, neither New York City nor Miami is under water (although, it is true that many cities are sinking, and the seas, they are arising).  Scientists are predicting that the planet average will rise by something around 3 degrees after a doubling of CO2.  That will NOT take place before about 2080, and the range of error on that estimate is 50%.  There is a phenomenon that exists that suggests that the poles will warm faster than ""other areas"" and the equator will warm change the least of all.  So, maybe the poles will warm by 6 degrees, while the equator goes up by a half a degree?  The ""adiabatic lapse rate"" is a known issue where temperature changes with altitude.  The generally accepted value is something like 9.8 degrees per kilometer.  So, if the temperature changes by, oh, 2 degrees where you live, how far uphill do you need to move to offset that?  (the answer is about 200 meters)  Winters will be milder, and summers will be a bit ""longer.""  With more heat, we will get more convection (warm air rises, cooling as it goes), and when warm air rises up to several thousand meters, it will have cooled off and also radiated away heat (via CO2) at altitudes where it is highly unlikely to ever return to the surface.  Cool air then falls back to the surface.  We'll have a small increase in wind energy overall, which is good if we put up wind turbines to generate electricity.  We can build passive thermal chimneys to encourage hot air to rise, taking the heat with it.  A thermal chimney in (or near) a city could move large volumes of hot air upwards, moving thermal energy with it. We can generate energy while that happens.",against

Climate Change is specifically defined as ""warming due to human causes"" in the IPCC literature.  This is what we're talking about, warming.    The best literature out there, the science, says that there are many causes of global warming (Climate Change), and that the chief among those causes is an increase in atmospheric CO2.  Not, by far, the only cause; just the one with the biggest effect.  Again, this is according to accepted science.  I, personally, don't think that increased atmospheric CO2 is as impactful to the surface temperature as the Climate Science industry claims, but we can debate how many Angels can dance on the head of a pin later.  Your worry about the change in oceanic ph is not, technically, Climate Change.    So, what can you do to help mitigate or prevent a change in oceanic pH?  Well, I suppose you could stop doing those things that increase CO2 in the water.  Or course, there's a double-edged sword, here.  Warming water causes CO2 that is dissolved in that water to outgas, moving from the water to the atmosphere.  Warming waters, then, cause atomspheric CO2 to climb.    In order to prevent more burning of fossil fuels, you and all of the other concerned people need to do some things.  You need to stop buying goods that are shipped using fossil fuels.  That's, well, all goods.  You'll need to stop buying power produced by coal, oil, or natural gas. That's, well, 98% of the power that's produced.  It's easy to buy electricity from renewable sources. It's more expensive, but you're saving the planet, right?  So spend more for your electricity. Oh, and use less of it.  How much power do you use per month?  Do you live in the North, where winters are cold (requiring you to heat your home) and summers are hot (requiring you to cool your home?)  Consider moving.  When you move, don't get a big place.  Move in to a tiny space, near enough to work where you can walk or cycle. Also, buy your produce at local farmer's markets or even better, grow what you can on your own.  Don't buy beef or pork or chicken or fish.  The beef is the worst, but factory farmed pork is horrible, and chicken grow houses are just awful as well.  You know we are depleting the wild fish populations with overfishing, with something like 70% of fish populations being wiped out already, right?  Farm raised fish is okay, but you really should limit your fish consumption.  So, stop being a normal, American consumer, buying things you don't need with money you don't have, to impress people you don't like.  Instead, live small and simple, eat mostly vegetables and a few simple grains, walk or cycle instead of owning a car, and buy your power from renewable sources.",favor
qp0n,2018-04-23 20:53:42,dxudi5o,8eb9ic,8eb9ic,climateskeptics,"- CO2 has essentially maxed out the amount heat it can trap. The relation is not linear, it's logarithmic. There have been a lot of studies on this. There really isn't any more 'harm' that CO2 can do, the only warming that can happen now  would come from water vapor &amp; methane.  - The milankovich cycle largely explains a lot of the polar anomalies and most other climate/temp anomalies that have wrongly been attributed to greenhouse gases. There's WAY more at play in our climate than a supercommon cosmic gas comprising 0.06% of the atmosphere.  - CO2 is a MASSIVE boon to the bottom of the food pyramid; we have seen an unprecedented greening of the earth as a direct result. Increased CO2 also causes plant growth to require less water, greening areas that were previously deserts. Demonizing a fundamental chemical compound just because its a known byproduct of an industry the leftwing politicians hate should be a giant ""Qui Bono?"" red flag that this is about politics not the environment. If they cared so much about the environment then why are they hiding the benefits?  - Both temperatures and CO2 have been at MUCH MUCH MUCH higher levels in the past than they are today, and the world didnt spiral into runaway global heat then... it instead fostered the Cambrian Explosion of life. There's no evidence to suggest the doomsday 'runaway warming' hypotheses. And these periods prove that climate can change drastically without any human interference, and also that CO2 plays essentially no role in that.  - The climate change models have been disgustingly wrong, and they rely on horrible assumptions that dont seem to get questioned because of the implications of bad assumptions (proving the base assumptions wrong would be tantamount to showing million yr old fossils to a church of religious zealots that believe the earth is 5000 yrs old). *What if I told you that all modern climate models are using as one of its base assumptions a model for cloud reflection that works locally but not globally, because when used globally it assumes the earth is flat?* Since models are the only thing that the climate fear is based on, there is nothing to fear when those models are worthless.",against

Mann did not fully graft the thermometer on a reconstruction, but he stopped the smoothed series in their end years. The trick is more sophisticated, and was uncovered by UC over here.  &gt;When smoothing these time series, the Team had a problem: actual reconstructions “diverge” from the instrumental series in the last part of 20th century. For instance, in the original hockey stick (ending 1980) the last 30-40 years of data points slightly downwards. In order to smooth those time series one needs to “pad” the series beyond the end time, and no matter what method one uses, this leads to a smoothed graph pointing downwards in the end whereas the smoothed instrumental series is pointing upwards — a divergence. So Mann’s solution was to use the instrumental record for padding, which changes the smoothed series to point upwards..",against

However, it's possible for a model to be slightly wrong without being complete garbage.  There actually isn't even clear consensus that the 20-year-hiatus was real because of some calibration issues with how the observations were taken.  Those who do think that the hiatus was real seem to have attributed it to the Walker Cell, which has strengthened in recent years instead of weakening (which is what climate models predict).  The Walker Cell has gotten weaker compared to, say, the 1950s, so it's not obvious if the recent strengthening is just an artifact of random variability or if it's because of something else.  2) You can think of climate as being the signal, whereas weather is the noise.  It's just a random, relatively small perturbation to whatever the base climate state is.  For instance, you don't know what the weather will be next week, but you do have a rough idea of how May should be (as opposed to, say, December).  The random noise of weather is really hard to predict, but if you take an average over a long time, that noise gets smoothed out, and the mean state (ie climate) is much better behaved.  I think this is actually a very complicated topic.  If it helps, take a look at this plot http://blog.catchpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Signal-processing.jpg.  The red line is the signal, and the blue line is the noise.  You can imagine that whatever physics describes the noise is way more complicated than the physics that describes the signal, which is smoother and much more regular.

This is the theme of repeating heavy snowfalls late in the season across the northern tier of states. The coolest areas experience global cooling first, as do the higher elevation areas.  The solar minimum has been reached 18 months earlier than expected, and this is a likely result, colder, snowier winters. IN the southern states the mosquitoes are simply not there this year, due to prolonged cold. By Feb. those are usually seen. Very, very few biters seen even now nearing May. So the insects are ALSO providing evidence for substantial cooling in North AM.  IN Europe and Africa the same is being seen. Dreadful freezing damaging about 30-40% of the greenhouse veg/fruits in southern Spain, upon which Europe depends for food. Prolonged severe cold in eastern Europe and W. Russia.  Snowfalls in norther Morocco's Atlas mtns. , and then TWO successive snowfalls, the first in 50 years, in southern Morocco, as well.  This is gobal cooling with a vengeance, and frankly, those believing ""warming"" were totally unprepared.  Man proposes, the universe disposes, is the operating rule here. A huge cognitive dissonance has opened up between what warming enthusiasts state and what's actually happening.  As the solar sunspot cycles die back, or even disappear this will grow ever more serious. Dr. Zharkov's successfuil model likely shows this:  https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/07/150709092955.htm  If we have a long overdue calderic, massive volcanic eruption, then it will be a very serious blow to agro world wide. and the impact of THAT upon population could well be catastrophic, with TWO major cooling events coinciding. and we might not have any more than a few weeks warning of such a huge eruption, either. If it occurs in the later summer, it's curtains. If it occurs during the later spring, then we could increase planting to survive.  But beware Murphy';s Law. What often happens happens at the worst possible time and in the worst way.

You also don't get a consensus by giving out surveys that ask 100 questions about a theory only to use one question on that survey as proof that 98% of the group agrees.

Like the OP above, they are not getting the results they predicted.  The models are wrong, and the temps are not where they said they would be.      A simple test to this is the polar bear.  Many tried to use the polar bear as proof that climate change was real, and that their numbers would go down.  YET... their numbers went up.  [The bears that had GPS's attached to them that had recorded them walking on water for 6 weeks.](http://bishophill.squarespace.com/blog/2015/9/3/polar-bears-walk-on-water.html)  This means one of two things.  That polar bears can indeed walk on water.  OR, that the melted ice was in fact not melted.  Now, I'm no polar bear expert, but I have yet to find where bears swim or walk on water for 6 weeks at a time without touching land.  BUT, I do find results where scientist have falsely reported melted ice sheets where their was visibly ice.  For instance, the time that  the scientist got stuck in the ice when they went to investigate the melted ice.

Yes, science agrees the climate changes, but they all don't agree it's running away at an alarming rate.  2nd.

After doing this reading and research, It started to appear to me that things just didn't add up.  These things include:  * is the Earth really warming? * if it is, is this warming bad? * is this warming unusual in the history of Earth? * are the current temperatures unusual in the history of Earth? * on the geological time scale do temperature and carbon dioxide correlate? * in the more recent years when temperature and carbon dioxide do correlate, which changes first? * do the official explanations for the alleged climate change make sense? * why did they change the name from global warming to climate change? * are there competing theories? * is the science *really* settled? * what does it mean when the science isn't settled, and they consistently say that it is settled? * what incentives are in place for scientists and or government officials to publish misleading data? * have there been previous predictions of future climate? If so have those predictions been correct? * how are the temperatures currently measured? By which proxies do they get old temperature data? * if what they're saying about climate change is correct, and if it is bad, then is the best solution to reduce carbon dioxide output? * do the purported benefits of reducing carbon dioxide output offset the harm caused by doing that? * why are the sun and water vapor underrepresented in current official explanations a climate change? * why, if the science is settled do prices of real estate in low-lying areas near the sea not reflect this future of being potentially underwater? * why do official explanations lack clear reasoning behind the use of interpolation in between data stations, and ignore potentially erroneous temperature sites? * why the lack of transparency? * why in 2014, did Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of U.N.'s Framework Convention on Climate Change say, ""This is the first time in the history of mankind that we are setting ourselves the task of intentionally, within a defined period of time, to change the economic development model that has been reigning for at least 150 years, since the Industrial Revolution...

Third, unlike any other science, it rejects critical examination, isn't falsifiabe, countenances diametrically opposite conclusions and relies almost entirely on projections.

YongeArcade,2018-04-30 00:13:25,dy6ma95,8frv65,8frv65,climateskeptics,"Starting from the beginning of my change of opinion  **The debate is over the consensus has spoken !!**.  Science is not a democracy, science is a series of proofs. The only consensus is that of a theory on a simple model. That model does not reflect the earth and it's complicated climatic and chemical systems. There is no second earth to test that theory on.   There have been many celebrated science that was settled by consensus in the past --(the) Ether. was supposed to be a substance that remained in a vacuum that transmitted light. Land bridges, before the idea of continental drift for 100 years,  Land bridges supposedly cris-crossed every ocean and left similar fossils in England and  Argentina.  Consensus does not make any science ""right"" -- Always remember every laughable scientific idea in the past had a ""consensus"" too.     **Fixing the facts to fit the theory**   This was my beginning of skepticism. From the '""Hockey stick graph"" bunkum to other papers where someone has done the leg work and comb through the data to discover that they eliminated all the weather stations that did not show warming.   Their excuse when confronted, they were getting ""better"" science from the historic weather stations that existed in 1878. No quite the opposite, When the station was place there it was a farmers field in 1878 and currently is apart of a sprawling city and apart of the ""heat island"" of Tarmac and A/c exhaust in summer and building heat exhaust in the summer, but they eliminated all the newer placed weather stations which were in farmers field that did not show any change in 75 or 50 years.   More on historic weather -- remember another of a world map where it showed a sudden jump in temperature in the 1990's 'Global warming proven' . Multiple sources prove it!   Again some sceptic had to comb through it and found that yes they used multiple sources, One included the Arctic and Antarctic in its measurements and the other did not. The paper just stopped using the the one with arctic temperatures when they wanted it to rise and to show it was cooler in the past.   NASA fixed their satellite when it failed to show ocean temperature rise-- and I notice that it is always fixed in favour of the theory never against it. That would be called fraud. Just by chance if there were real faults it should fall in the opposition's favour on occasion. But that never seems to happen.   I could go on but time is short. -- I know creationist science when i see it   **Every government ""solution"" is a Ponzi scheme or a hippy's wet dream**   Nuclear energy should be the first solution to reducing carbon.--They wont touch it. Guess ""consensus science"" only applies to things they like.    Second is using things that we already have built to it's entire lifetime as we slowly change over. Such as coal generating plants switched to gas and bio-gas, assisted heating with low temperature nuclear .   Nope -- ( in my province ) they tore down newly refurbished coal plants to cheer they eliminated coal. Built 1000\s of windmills ( steel produce with unicorn farts) and a huge Ponzi scheme that paid 10xs the rate of electricity from them. Hiked everyone's electricity rates to pay for it.  And other Ponzi schemes that seem to have a large number of the politicians and insiders who are True believers  at the helm.  Climate credits -- Carbon Taxes -- Green energy -- Hydrogen -- government paid electric charging stations.  They put Ethanol in the gas here and want to increase the amount. I live in Canada  Ethanol does not atomize or burn below 10 centigrade. It just pits and eats the metal shortening the lifespan of the car.  Also older engines that are not rated for ethanol that use rubber parts -- it eats the rubber seals in the gas tank and carburetor.  Like old lawn mowers that you had for decades -- so people have to throw them out and buy new one. Increasing carbon produced to make new cars and lawn mowers and snowmobiles -- and that was the solution to reduce carbon.       There was great fanfare when the government bought 100's of millions of dollars in Hydrogen buses in Whistler BC . All the ""Green"" celebrities like David Suzuki were there. They had to scrap them all or convert them to diesel in 2 years when it all failed -- not a peep heard. Now currently they are spending millions to look at converting the inercity trains to Hydrogen. Again scrapping vehicals early ( producing more carbon )  in an attempt to reduce carbon   Kind of reminds me of Communism --- This time it will work!! Nope. Okay now this time ....? Okay this time I am sure...   I also do  work in heating -- problem there is to squeeze higher efficiency out of the furnace you have to make the heat exchange walls thinner and thinner.  I have noticed a large number of furnaces that have to be scrapped earlier than they should because their heat exchanger has cracked. Before when they were 75-80% efficient and the exchanger's wall was twice as thick it could take an overtemp situation from a prolonged clogged air filter or blocked air intake -- not any longer--all to squeeze an extra 5% efficiency out of them  again New furnaces must be made with unicorn farts since they are not included in the drive to reduce carbon   I could go on and on and on -- Something is not right and when you raise scientific fact and observation you are shouted down as a ""climate denier""              ",against

I am a skeptic in the sense that although I believe that the climate is changing, this change is nothing new or even particularly unusual. Nor do I believe that it is even remotely dangerous to mankind in general.   However there is a group of people who has seized on climate fear as a means to an end. What is this end? Reordering of society into their vision of perfection.  Let's look at these facts:  One of the biggest lies told by the fear prophets is that the Earth has never been this warm. Well, that is just flat out wrong.  http://www.co2science.org/articles/V16/N50/EDIT.php  Once you point this out to them they run right out and move the goal posts. Their favorite mantra of late is that the temperature has never changed this fast. Once again they are wrong!  [The Younger Dryas](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/abrupt-climate-change/The%20Younger%20Dryas) *he end of the Younger Dryas, about 11,500 years ago, was particularly abrupt. In Greenland, for example, the average temperatures rose 10°C (18°F) in a decade*  Then we have the [8.2 kiloyear event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.2_kiloyear_event).   There's two times it's changed faster in the last 12k years.  Then they jump on the trope that polar bears dying off.

Surly we must do something about that. Well, not necessarily.   Sure the climate is changing, maybe the Earth is warming. But that is as it should be since we are less that 15% through an inter-glacial period.  But we will adapt, life will go on.  Some species may not be able to adapt, but there is nothing new there. Did you know that [99.9% of all species that have ever existed are already extinct](https://www.google.com/search?q=percentage+of+extinct+species&amp;oq=percentage+of+extinct+species%5C&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.16079j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)?  The sky is falling crowd will never bring out that statistic. Species go extinct others move up the ladder to replace them it is a natural part of life on this planet.

Basic high school botany indicates just the opposite.  Even NASA has been forced to agree that the [earth is actually getting greener](https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2436/co2-is-making-earth-greenerfor-now/).  Of course they had to add the ever present ""For Now""  And then they add ""The beneficial impacts of carbon dioxide on plants may be limited,""  MAY BE, so they actually don't know and are expecting the worst.   In fact, the Co2 concentration today is about 400 ppm. In the late Ordovician Period, which was ended in an ice age by the way, Co2 concentrations were  11 times higher than today at about 4400 ppm. If high Co2 is the main cause of global warming how could an ice age occur in such conditions? [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordovician#End_of_the_period) *The late Ordovician glaciation event was preceded by a fall in atmospheric carbon dioxide (from 7000 ppm to 4400 ppm).*  Climate change is a natural process that the Earth has experienced many times in the past. We have absolute proof that the Earth was much warmer, and much cooler in the past. In fact there is ample evidence that the Earth is still in a warming trend since the end of the last ice age about 11k years ago. At some point in the future the trend will reverse and we will enter a new ice age. Ice ages have occurred about every hundred thousand years. According to the [Milankovitch cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles) we will be entering a new ice age in about 89k years.  But what is interesting is that we are likely still experiencing lower than normal temperatures due to the lingering effects of the last ice age.  And just to show you how wrong the doom and gloom crowd has been:  Just three years ago these were the headlines:  https://www.wired.com/2016/05/thanks-el-nino-californias-drought-probably-forever/   https://ww2.kqed.org/science/2016/08/24/why-californias-current-drought-is-different-than-the-past/  https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/10/us/california-drought-water-restrictions-permanent.html  Last fall these were the the headlines:  https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/07/us/california-drought.html  https://wattsupwiththat.com/2017/04/08/what-permanent-drought-california-governor-officially-declares-end-to-drought-emergency/  https://wattsupwiththat.com/2017/02/11/lessons-learned-from-the-end-of-californias-permanent-drought/  http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/drought-over-water-s-dramatic-return-california-n745841  Always wrong! Each and every prediction of death and destruction is wrong! So, why should we put any trust in them?  Here are just a few more of their sky is falling predictions:  Mar 29, 2001:  In ten years Tuvalu's nine islands in the South Pacific Ocean will be submerged under water. *Director of the UN Environment Program*.  Oops wrong again.   http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/02/150213-tuvalu-sopoaga-kench-kiribati-maldives-cyclone-marshall-islands/  Princeton professor and lead UN IPCC author Michael Oppenheimer said the following in 1990: By 1995,the greenhouse effect will desolating the heartlands of North America and Eurasia with horrific drought, causing crop failures and food riots. By 1996 the Platte River of Nebraska will be dry, while a continent-wide black blizzard of prairie topsoil will stop traffic on interstates, strip paint from houses and shut down computers. The situation will so bad that Mexican police will round up illegal American migrants surging into Mexico seeking work as field hands...   WOW, can we say WRONG!!!!!  Within a few years winter snowfall will become a very rare and exciting even. Children just aren't going to know what snow is. Dr David Viner, Senior research scientist at the climatic research unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia - Mar 20, 2000....   WRONG! The National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center data showed U.S. snow cover on the morning of Dec. 1, 2015 is the highest on record for this day of the year. In all, 38.7 percent of the United States was covered in snow, surpassing the previous record — 36.5 percent — set in 2006. Worldwide, similar trends have been observed. Global Snow Lab data also shows Eurasian autumn snow cover has grown by 50 percent since records began in 1979.  In New York City by 2008, the West Side Highway which runs along the Hudson River will be under water said James Hansen testimony before Congress in June 1988  Environmental refugees to top 50 million in 5 years. UNU-EHS Director Janos Bogardi. - United Nations University news release - October 11, 2005  But, that's not all. Every promised disaster, every prediction of doom, every bad thing that has been promised has failed to materialize.   Can you show me just one major loss of life or property event that absolutely can be proven to have happened because of global warming? Please show me just one.  Climate changes, animals adapt, humans adapt. Humans are the most adaptable creatures on the planet.   They tell us that we must give up our modern way of life, give up freedoms and our hard earned independence in order to save the planet, yet there is not one solid piece of evidence that doing so will make any difference.  I have showed you a wealth of false predictions and promises that the chicken little's trot out all day long. I can show you hundreds more promises from that same doom and gloom crowd, made by supposed professionals that have not come to pass.   And I repeat, can you show me one, just one, major loss of life event that was positively caused by climate change? If you can then, maybe, I would reconsider.

A 1 in 150,000,000 year asteroid impact is such a risk. It is however extremely low probability event. And perhaps in another 50-100 years, human society will be advanced and wealthy enough to design “early detection and deflection of deadly astroid” technology.  Do you agree that during past 500 years (since municipal and literary references recorded data), plate tetonics, silt deposits, erosion, and ordinary sea-level changes (rises and falls) over a period of 100 years has each routinely varied in range of -18” to +18” (varying geographically and temporally)? As such a global sea level rise of less than 36” per 100 years would not qualify as “catastrophic.” Right?  If so, scientists and media should not be “sounding the alarm” when geology of Miami beach sees it sink an inch in 10 years (and sea level rises an inch in 10 years for a total measurable change of 2” in 10 years, or extrapolating 20” in 100 years).

A pause clearly is not “accelerating.” Though now new data, and revisions to old data, partially negate all those papers, we can’t have “settled science” defined as “36 months of new and revised data fitting our narrative”.  Put another way, forecasting catastrophic sea level rises of 25’ 50’ or more feet in next 100 years as a base case is not supported by settled science.  Can we afford to keep an eye on the science of global warming? Sure. Can we worry about tail risks? Sure.

If a moving average (boxcar or FIR filter) is used then climate becomes a smoothed function of weather versus time.  By itself, a 1,000 year static average of weather isn't particularly useful, it's just a horizontal line spanning 1,000 years on a graph. Smoothing (moving average filtering) is used to selectively attenuate short duration artifacts in the signal to reveal longer duration trends.  I fail to see how this becomes a qualitative difference, climate represented as a static average or by a smoothing filter is fundamentally the same, climate is still averaged weather.",against

A better example is Tambora in 1815, the year without a summer.

I'm not arguing that volcanoes don't have an effect on the weather or the climate.  They do.  But when you look at long-term averages, there is some background constant of volcanoes that will cool the climate, and climate models can simplify things by using a constant vs. having to predict every volcano.

Right at the bathroom break, [my boss] put a hand on my chest and pushed me up against the wall and said ‘Don’t ever mention the word cooling again. He did not mean it in a ‘joking’ way, he absolutely violated my personal space and was dead serious. This was back in 2014.  I am unable to track this down quickly. Nor do I know enough.  But sure, if it's warmer near the surface then there will be more heat bleed upwards which I guess will cause wavier streams in the higher layers. And that is cooling ... of something that is warmer.  the hotter an object is, the faster it will lose its heat. Whether its a frying pan or a planet.

Still, you didn't comment until a month ago, so that's probably what you meant.  &gt;Can you explain to me the GCM process more in detail please  General Circulation Models (GCMs) are ostensibly built by modelling the physics of the climate system. Downwelling solar radiation, upwelling infrared from the surface, albedo based on geography, all that jazz. Of course trying to model complex, chaotic systems is incredibly difficult. Some would say that trying to model any chaotic system borders on a fool's errand, but I'll not touch that today.   The problems with GCMs are many, as you might expect, but the two biggest are:  - Poor spatial resolution. If memory serves, I think they are actually still using 1 km^2 grids, which is probably a couple of orders of magnitude too coarse to be very useful.  - Clouds. The modellers themselves have been very forthright about clouds being the largest source of uncertainty in their models. The hypothesis goes that CO2 warming will lead to more water vapor, which leads to more warming. Water vapor is, by far, the largest positive feedback in climate models. The problem is that if water vapor encounters enough cloud condensation nuclei, it forms (*drumroll*) clouds. That turns a strong positive feedback (water vapor) into a weak or even negative feedback (clouds), depending on cloud type, altitude, etc.   So GCMs aren't really coded based on past data, like you suggest. Instead, the models are tested against historical data, which they never match. (Such is the nature of complex, chaotic systems. You won't get a good match because the system is always in some sort of flux.) In order to hindcast, modellers then tweak models to reasonably match historical records. Unfortunately, such parameterization (tweaking) isn't based on physics. It's just introduced to fit the curve, as it were. That's a big problem, and I think modellers generally understand that it's a big problem. The bigger problem is that people who don't know much about science or coding take the modelled forecasts and treat them like they are Kepler's Laws or something. They treat such modelled results as more certain than they really are. The honest folks can be identified by their acknowledgement of these uncertainties. They will say things like, ""All models are wrong, but some are useful.""   Contrast GCMs with the other major approach to understanding climate, which is the energy balance approach. The recent Lewis and Curry paper (which is an update of their 2015 paper), uses this approach, as did Otto, et al 2013. (The latter paper is significant because of the authors who wrote it and the fact that it essentially acknowledged the validity of this method.)   This approach looks at temperature data at different periods of time and calculates climate sensitivity based on changes in known forcings between those two periods of time.   It's significant that energy balance models produce significantly lower values for climate sensitivity than do GCMs, and this divergence is the reason the authors of AR5 declined to state a most likely value for one measure of climate sensitivity known as equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS).

The invention made by Mullis allowed PCR to become a central technique in biochemistry and molecular biology, described by The New York Times as ""highly original and significant, virtually dividing biology into the two epochs of before P.C.R. and after P.C.R.""

Some tidbits from the full report (my emphasis): &gt;In a geographically representative longitudinal study of Americans, we found that climate change belief varies by both seasonal changes and individual differences. Specifically, **our participants believed in climate change less during colder (vs. warmer) months**, consistent with prior research on heat effects on climate change belief (Borick &amp; Rabe, 2014).  And this:  &gt;Therefore, although we cannot explain the pattern of results between climate change belief clusters and self-reported proenvironmental behaviors in the present manuscript, we can offer some speculations worthy of future research. Why did the “Highly Concerned” report significantly less pro-environmental behavior than their “Skeptical” peers, despite endorsing federal climate change policies? Of course, there are limitations to selfreported behavior, which does not always correspond to objective behavior and may be influenced by factors such as social desirability bias (Kormos &amp; Gifford, 2014). However, social desirability is an unlikely explanation for our effects: Socially desirable responding would predict that the “Highly Concerned,” not the “Skeptical,” would be more likely to inaccurately inflate their reporting of pro-environmental behavior. One possible explanation could again relate to measuring politics with more granularity: Perhaps our “Skeptical” participants had more libertarian leanings, leading them to report engaging in individuallevel behavior over endorsing federal government climate change policies. Or, the “Skeptical” might have been motivated to report behaving pro-environmentally for other reasons that they did not associate with climate change, such as reducing pollution or waste accumulation. Other possibilities for these results involve the “Highly Concerned”: Perhaps they engaged in moral licensing (Merritt, Effron, &amp; Monin, 2010), whereby their concern about climate change psychologically liberated them from engaging in (and reporting) pro-environmental behavior. Or, perhaps the “Highly Concerned” felt that federal policies were the more effective means of addressing climate change (vs. individual pro-environmental behaviors). We cannot currently address these possibilities, but they are exciting avenues for future research.  I think they have missed two other possible explanations:  1. Socio economic status. Poor people are more likely to use public transports which was part of the pro environmental behaviours. And poor people with poor education are also more likely to not trust science and believe in propaganda. 2. Maybe scepticals are actually engaged in reverse moral licensing, where they are overtly sceptical and speak against ""the government"" to brand themselves to their peers, but they actually engage in pro environmental behaviours to ease the moral burden.

This can mean that if I believe that the climate changes by 0.01° C per year, in either direction, I'm a believer in climate change, but it could also mean that if I believe there will be drastic changes to our climate, but most of that change is due to natural forces, I believe in Climate Change.  It also could mean that if I don't believe that man is responsible for more than 100% of the observed changes, I *don't believe in climate change*, depending on how the researchers define the term. And their definition is never included in the survey.  So, I could construct surveys and distribute them in fully scientific manner, have a statistician calculation the results, and interpret them any way I saw fit, to come to whatever conclusion I already wanted to see at the end.  When you start with a conclusion and work your way to gathering the data to support that conclusion, it's not science.

In the video he clearly states ""We can't predict with any certainty what's happening with our own climatic future"". He's being very honest to a media that wants sensationalism. 2. Read quote from u/barttali above. When Schneider became aware of his error, he announced it and retracted his findings. Even if he didn't retract himself, the way science works is that his results would have to be replicated by others before his findings were accepted by the community. 3. Why do you selectively quote him? He says:  &gt;***On the one hand,*** *as scientists we are ethically bound to the scientific method, in effect promising to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but — which means that we must include all the doubts, the caveats, the ifs, ands, and buts.* ***On the other hand***, we are not just scientists but human beings as well. And like most people we'd like to see the world a better place, which in this context translates into our working to reduce the risk of potentially disastrous climatic change. To do that we need to get some broadbased support, ***to capture the public's imagination. That, of course, entails getting loads of media coverage. So we have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have***. This 'double ethical bind' we frequently find ourselves in cannot be solved by any formula. Each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest. ***I hope that means being both.***  He's expressing a dilemma of communicating complex science to the public through mass media.  On one hand... scientists are ethically bound to express uncertainty.  On the other hand... the media and the public have no appetite for it. They want sensationalism.  He understands this, but hopes that it is possible to both be wholly truthful and also capture the attention of the public on important issues. In the video he is being  balanced by very clearly stating how uncertain his findings at the time were.

At present the financial incentives are not active as there is still development going on, but once complete, you put a bounty on articles you report. When enough people post enough TRV tokens as a bounty up, a researcher will grab the story and set up a claims sheet and do the research to verify or disprove the claims made in the article (and not just that article, but all other stories making the same claim, and stories referencing those stories.)  &gt;When the researcher is done, they submit their work, which is hashed and stashed on the Trive blockchain as an immutable record. The researcher then wins the bounty in an escrow. Now, others can check the work. If someone doubts the validity of the researchers work they can challenge it, and redo the work, finding new information. Both researcher and challenger can do original research (like doing their own climate studies) if they want to as evidence.  &gt;Now that there are two challenging sets of research, a jury is chosen. Jurors are paid no matter which side they pick, and they cannot have participated in a similar process with any of the other participants to prevent Sybyl Attacks by teams of biased individuals (like we’ve seen at Wikipedia’s climate articles). The jury examines the differing facts and votes on which is true. They can theoretically reject both sets of research if they choose.

In the 1970s and 80s, when we were sending men into space, to the moon, etc. we measured the average temperature of the planet as 288.5 Kelvin.  In the 2000s, the climate scientists lowered this estimate to 288 Kelvin as a ""pre-global warming average"" and adjusted all temperatures before the late 1990s to smooth out the trend and provide evidence of a temperature rise that matched the rise in CO2.  If we have risen 1° C in since the pre-industrial age, that's just over 0.3%.  We know that the sun was more active in the late 19th Century, but the Alarmists, who want us focused on CO2 instead, say that the total deviation of the sun is only about 0.1%.  My claim is that the Urban Heat Island effect has been downplayed and is more impacting of temperature reconstructions than is being admitted, that the effects of homogenization tend to skew the data into a false warming trend, and that the effects of solar changes are responsible for 1/3 of the observed warming.  This leaves a bit for increased CO2, but not much.  There have been dozens, possibly hundreds of recent, peer reviewed studies suggesting that the estimates of climate sensitivity to increased atmospheric CO2 are much lower than is currently accepted.  Time will tell, but every time we suggest that you guys wait before calling for drastic action, you pull out the ""if we wait, and you're wrong, the world will suffer catastrophic disaster.""  So, I'm going to suggest that you are wrong, but we should go ahead and implement whatever drastic actions you desire to fix this.  Carbon tax? You bet.  How about an immediate 100% carbon tax?  Let's double, triple the cost of doing anything with energy.  That will stifle production, kill most nations' economies, and drive the world into a severe depression.

The disagreement is:  1. You can show decades of failures of climate science. 2. There is not a single accurate prediction in climate science. 3.

matmyob,2018-05-11 04:32:26,dysgrw8,8i2bot,dyq81up,climateskeptics,"First, let's be clear about ""failure"". All models are wrong \(that's what makes them models, not reality\). So if a model makes a prediction within its range of uncertainty, that is not a ""failure"". That's good science. Current warming rates have been pretty successfully modelled since the 1990s. ECS is completely different, because it's uncertain about when ""equilibrium"" will be reached. Will it be in 100 years? 1000 years? 10,000? It all depends on deep ocean circulation and the speed of the ice collapse, which are still active areas of research, so of course there will be larger disagreement over ECS.  Now, to your points:  &gt;1.Decades of failure started in the late sixties, do you deny this?  You were asked to cite an example of decades of failure. You haven't done this yet. And ""decades of failure"" implies the decades proceeding the present. Otherwise, why not go back to the decades 1850\-1880? I'm sure those predictions weren't as good as current ones.  &gt;2.By making predictions that cover every possible scenario, at least 1 is bound to be correct. Using an average of the models is disingenuous because no single model was accurate. By covering every possible scenario, you eliminate falsifiability.  Good science is clear about uncertainties in predictions. Temperature increases are within the bounds of uncertainty of IPCC projections. Even taking the lower bounds, that's still a heck of a lot of warming over the 21st C. If there was a lot of COOLING predicted, then you might have a point.  So what exactly is your issue here?  &gt;3.It has been, numerous times and with every year the pause continues it needs to be adjusted downward.  ""the pause continues"". Where? No satellite, surface and ocean temperature record I know of has a continuing ""pause"". That's RSS, UAH, GISSTEMP, HADCRUT, BEST, none of these show ""the pause continues"". So, show me a source which you think backs up your statement.  &gt;4.The IPCC didn't give a value due to the wide disparity in values.  Wrong.  &gt;The equilibrium climate sensitivity \(ECS\) is likely in the range 1.5°C to 4.5°C, extremely unlikely less than 1°C, and very unlikely greater than 6°C.  [Source, AR5 page 62.](https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full.pdf)  And for the record, no, not all predictions have been ""perfect"". But in my opinion they have been ""fit for purpose"". The purpose is to predict the general rate of warming under different CO2 emission scenarios with stated degree of uncertainty. Which they did.
