burtzev,2019-11-26 19:47:11,f8t7r9d,t3_e1u51o,t1_f8t6fs0,Quite a few more actually looking at the larger picture.  Yesterday was the International Day to Stop Violence Against Women. Or are you referring to demonstrations specifically against legislation that sets the clock back ?
Trystiane,2019-11-26 20:59:20,f8texzc,t3_e1u51o,t1_f8t7r9d,No this is just the third major march in a different country I have seen this week.  So I guess the International Day is working!

blattodeath,2019-12-08 13:50:16,fa59lpr,t3_e7qkf6,t3_e7qkf6,"The gaslighting is real. I am neither black nor a woman, but this happens everytime an oppressed minority - especially black women - react to the oppression and the abuse they have to endure.  *""Don't fight hate with hate""*, they say. We are not allowed to have an emotional response to the social injustice we are subjected to, because it will be equated to our oppressors' supremacist beliefs and used to invalidate our points."
Trystiane,2019-12-08 20:51:28,fa7un34,t3_e7qkf6,t3_e7qkf6,This is such an important discussion.  I think the angry black woman trope is related to the more romanticized version of black women as inherently strong and able to bear the weight of multiple forms of oppression.  Its like those are the only two options -- superheroic strength or irrational anger.  Its so dehumanizing to deny people the full range of human expression and emotion.
Whenthedaybreaks,2019-12-15 00:32:45,fawek9u,t3_e7qkf6,t1_fa59lpr,Emotional arguments are usually taken less seriously though.
rmrilke,2019-12-18 14:35:52,fbajfuc,t3_ec8og5,t3_ec8og5,"As a military lawyer this article is frustrating and heartbreaking.  First, we have numerous programs to financially support DV victims who come forward. If a Soldier is separated from the Army because their spouse testified to their violence, the spouse is entitled to receive a housing allowance (estimated cost of rent for geographic location) FOR UP TO THREE YEARS.    Victims can also request for the Army to pay for them to IMMEDIATELY relocate after reporting DV, so they can move some place safe (back home to parents). I‚Äôve never seen a request be turned down.  There are legal problems associated with taking the children without abusers permission but the Army doesn‚Äôt have jurisdiction to control that, it has to be resolved in civilian courts.  This article further perpetuates the myth among spouses that they are trapped. There is no other employer in the US that will pay a victim of domestic violence money FOR YEARS to help them get out from under an abusive relationship.  I don‚Äôt mean to blindly defend the Army, it‚Äôs certainly not perfect.  But if abused spouses find this article they won‚Äôt learn anything helpful, they‚Äôll get an incorrect confirmation they are trapped."
terfling,2019-12-18 17:40:39,fbb0opj,t3_ec8og5,t1_fbajfuc,You should write to HuffPost and see if they'll include your comments as a footnote. They really should at least do that.
jesster114,2019-12-18 19:54:31,fbbeo4d,t3_ec8og5,t1_fbajfuc,Thank you for that. I‚Äôm no fan of the army but it‚Äôs interesting to hear viewpoints related to that. I‚Äôm sure in your position you‚Äôve seen ways that the army has been less than great if not awful.  What role do you serve as a lawyer? Are you usually defending clients against the military or vice versa? Not really sure how to phrase it.
rmrilke,2019-12-20 01:21:59,fbf9at4,t3_ec8og5,t1_fbbeo4d,I have represented the military as a prosecutor and I have represented victims of sexual assault as their personal attorney to make sure their voice is heard in the process.

Kholzie,2020-03-05 05:29:49,fjj886y,t3_fddp00,t1_fjj2jlr,There are many reasons people choose to hold spiritual beliefs that have nothing to do with proving to others how edgy and smart they are.
BetterRemember,2020-03-05 09:08:41,fjjjol0,t3_fddp00,t1_fjj886y,"I think the discomfort here comes from the attempt to twist something that was built on a solid foundation of misogyny into something that could somehow be healthy for women to engage in. Abrahamic religions were largely formed to aid in the enslavement / oppression of women and it's near impossible to sepparate or purify such religions from that legacy. Sadly, even in the most liberal Christian communities this poem would be considered blasphemy."

ArkadiArkadas53,2020-03-08 23:51:01,fjz4whs,t3_fflcxa,t1_fjz3v6q,Would you mind explaining what that means and how it differs from reproductive rights?
_pitter_patter,2020-03-09 00:05:49,fjz69f9,t3_fflcxa,t1_fjz4whs,"&gt;Reproductive Justice is the complete physical, mental, spiritual, political, social, and economic well-being of women and girls, based on the full achievement and protection of women‚Äôs human rights. This definition as outlined by Asian Communities for Reproductive Justice (ACRJ) offers a new perspective on reproductive issues advocacy, pointing out that for Indigenous women and women of  color it is important to fight equally for (1) the right to have a child; (2) the right not to have a child; and (3) the right to parent the children we have, as well as to control our birthing options, such as midwifery. We also fight for the necessary enabling conditions to realize these rights. This is in contrast to the singular focus on abortion by the pro-choice movement that excludes other social justice movements.  &gt;The Reproductive Justice framework analyzes how the ability of any woman to determine her own reproductive destiny is linked directly to the conditions in her community‚Äîand these conditions are not just a matter of  individual choice and access.  Reproductive Justice addresses the social reality of  inequality, specifically, the inequality of opportunities that we have to control our reproductive destiny. Moving beyond a demand for privacy and respect for individual decision making to include the social supports necessary for our individual decisions to be optimally realized, this framework also includes obligations from our government for protecting women‚Äôs human rights. Our options for making choices have to be safe, affordable, and accessible, three minimal cornerstones of  government support for all individual life decisions.  &gt;One of  the key problems addressed by Reproductive Justice is the isolation of  abortion from other social justice issues that concern communities of  color: issues of economic justice, the environment, immigrants‚Äô rights, disability rights, discrimination based on race and sexual orientation, and a host of other community-centered concerns. These issues directly affect an individual woman‚Äôs decision-making process. By shifting the focus to reproductive oppression‚Äîthe control and exploitation of  women, girls, and individuals through our bodies, sexuality, labor, and reproduction‚Äîrather than a narrow focus on protecting the legal right to abortion, SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Health Collective is developing a more inclusive vision of how to build a new movement.   &gt;Because reproductive oppression affects women‚Äôs lives in multiple ways, a multi-pronged approach is needed to fight this exploitation and advance the well-being of  women and girls. There are three main frameworks for fighting reproductive oppression defined by ACRJ:   &gt;1. Reproductive Health, which deals with service delivery &gt;2. Reproductive Rights, which addresses legal issues, and &gt;3. Reproductive Justice, which focuses on movement building.   &gt;Although these frameworks are distinct in their approaches, they work together to provide a comprehensive solution. Ultimately, as in any movement, all three components‚Äîservice, advocacy, and organizing‚Äîare crucial.   Loretta Ross"

In 1995, the United Nations reported that internationally the monetary value of unpaid domestic labour was $16 trillion, $11 trillion of that amount produced by women.

petethepool,2020-04-22 14:32:30,fo6smtd,t3_g61teh,t3_g61teh,"Considering the biggest risk factor are factory farms and wild animal markets, the amount of people actively funding the next crisis by buying meat will hopefully begin to decline. I‚Äôve always argued it‚Äôs a feminist issue anyway as it‚Äôs always the females who end up suffering longest, in the cruelest and most psychologically damaging ways ‚Äî it is the mothers who are forcibly impregnated (see: raped), who have their children taken from them, who are milked and fattened and re-impregnated time and again until their bodies fail them; at which point they are killed for meat. The males in these farms are often either killed immediately, or raised for meat more quickly, so suffer less whichever way you paint it. I really hope we see more women, feminists in particular, waking up to how much of animal agriculture subsumed on the gross exploitation of the female in all forms."
