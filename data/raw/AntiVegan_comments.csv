havel06,2020-06-20 23:07:01,fvhhfwe,t3_hcuml0,t1_fvhgb85,Sounds like a major conspiracy going on here.
havel06,2020-06-20 23:07:59,fvhhjhk,t3_hcuml0,t3_hcuml0,Because most of the studies are (in fact) conducted by vegans.
Tom_Scott74,2020-06-20 23:26:40,fvhjh7h,t3_hcuml0,t1_fvhhfwe,"Kind of like ""fat is bad, grain is good."" And then they added tons of sugar to everything."
WizardWatson9,2020-06-20 23:31:30,fvhjz5w,t3_hcuml0,t3_hcuml0,"Which studies and organizations are these that favor veganism? The general impression I've gotten from dietary research over the past several years is an emphasis on a *moderate* consumption of meat, like the much vaunted Mediterranean diet."
VastDiscombobulated,2020-06-21 00:12:35,fvho5lv,t3_hcuml0,t1_fvhgb85,"&gt; They want to lower the human population, especially the white population.  oh come on this as crazy as the shit on vegan subs"
1-800-sadgal,2020-06-21 00:15:56,fvhohfa,t3_hcuml0,t3_hcuml0,"I'm not well versed in politics and such, but here in Canada I think they derive how people will be fed in schools, hospitals and prisons from the national dietary recommandations. There are a lot of moving pieces and a lot of lobbyism. As some other commenters said, a lot of the studies that are conducted in nutrition science are made or founded by vegans or heavily plant based people nowadays.  It just so happens that plant based foods are a lot cheaper than animal foods. So for a government, it must be very convenient to accept those (oftentimes lacking in quality) evidence and switch your dietary recommandations to be heavily plant based. In doing that I imagine you can save a lot of money, feeding people in hospitals with tofu, rice and beans instead of ground beef or chicken. Same thing with school cafeterias, etc. If the food pyramid says it's ok, then why not do that.   So I think this creates a sort of echo chamber where animal products are slowly left out. But then it's not that simple, because there are also lobbies for animal products, so you end up with very contradictory nutritional recommandations like the most recent one in Canada. Spewing the same old ""don't eat too much cholesterol"", but also ""dairy is good for you but buy the low fat or no fat option"". Don't eat too much meat, or eat no meat at all, but if you choose to eat meat buy only those very specific cuts that don't have a lot of fat.  Trying to pander to the vegans and plant based people while trying not to destroy the industries the government has a lot of involvement and monies in, such as the dairy and eggs industry here. So they have to walk on eggshells, no pun intended, but being so vague must benefit them in some ways.   The situation in the states must be some variation of this too. Also vegans are convinced that they will save the world, our whole ecosystem and all the animals with what they are doing. I don't think they have any problems with the ethics of what they are doing on a political or scientific standpoint, because by default they think what they are doing is moral and righteous."
vdgift,2020-06-21 00:20:08,fvhowil,t3_hcuml0,t3_hcuml0,"Not just studies. Doctors, too. I visited a cardiologist recently who told me that plant-based diets are the healthiest diets, and that I should discontinue my animal-based WOE.   He couldn’t attribute any health problems to my diet, though. I have low blood pressure, which is supposedly the opposite effect of heavy meat consumption. It’s kind of sad how years of bad nutrition science has corrupted the world of medicine. Just goes to show that we aren’t that much more learned than our ancestors who thought that washing hands was useless or that mercury is a cure for constipation."
roaming_linguist,2020-06-21 00:41:37,fvhr0ns,t3_hcuml0,t3_hcuml0,"Well.  Basically.  This chick with epilepsy had a seizure in the 1860s where God supposedly told her to stop eating meat. So then this new vegetarian christian church formed, which grew big enough to found the American Dietetic Association and Loma Linda University to churn out veggie-preaching dietitians who shaped the modern American *mis*understanding of nutrition and continue to produce studies about the benefits of meat-free diets to this day.   And if that doesn't sound stupid and crazy enough, then Proctor &amp; Gamble invented ""vegetable oils"" --which are unfit for human consumption btw-- bought up the American Heart Association, who then mysteriously started singing the praises of vegetable oils to prevent heart disease.  So then US consumption of vegetable oils (polyunsaturated fats) skyrocketed, consumption of saturated fats plummeted, and heart disease skyrocketed. Mysterious.  And now, when I try to explain to my grandma why I don't want to eat fish fried in canola oil (aka rapeseed oil) at family get-togethers, I sound completely insane.  Because this whole situation sounds like some serious tinfoil hat conspiracy, but seriously google it, you'll see for yourself.  Thank you for coming to my TED rant."
kalospkmn,2020-06-21 00:55:56,fvhsfn7,t3_hcuml0,t3_hcuml0,"I don't think they favor veganism. Best I could really find was them saying ""Veganism can be done healthily with supplementation"". Which I disagree, but that's hardly a strong endorsement. Usually you just see advice like ""eat less red meat"" but that's different than ""eat no red meat"".  I clarify this, because vegans have in arguments with me said what you have, but their own sources aren't even saying veganism is the best diet or even close. They just say essentially that eating vegetables is healthy. I had q vegan link me to a random fb group (lol) and reply something like ""thousands of doctors support veganism and tell you not to eat meat, therefore you disagree with medical doctors""!!! Meanwhile I have NEVER had a doctor tell me to stop eating meat. Quite the opposite in fact."
BestGarbagePerson,2020-06-21 02:19:52,fvi0ldy,t3_hcuml0,t1_fvhr0ns,"You forgot also that the religion also grew large enough to own several big companies in agriculture in the grain/corn/soy/sugar industry. Partnering with other gran/corn/soy and sugar companies they worked to find ways to increase the prices and demand for unhealthy grain/corn/soy and sugar processed products, which they could sell at massive markups produced for pennies on the dollar.  Tagging u/Scared-Babe, read this wikipedia:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Nutrition_and_Dietetics  As well as start diving into what the major crops are in the US and what is done with their derivatives.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_the_United_States#Farm_type_or_majority_enterprise_type  And why they are the biggest:  https://www.farmprogress.com/corn-soybean-rotation-still-makes-sense  &gt;Research shows the most profitable rotation in the Corn Belt is the corn-soybean rotation   Corn is actually the largest crop in the US. Half of corn yield by weight is inedible fodder (corn stover)  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_stover  &gt;Corn stover consists of the leaves, stalks, and cobs of maize (corn) (Zea mays ssp. mays L.) plants left in a field after harvest. Such stover makes up about half of the yield of a corn crop[1] and is similar to straw from other cereal grasses;   This industry (corn and to a lesser degree soy as it is used in rotation) drives nearly all of the agriculture in the US, including factory farmed (CAFO) meat (particularly pork and beef).   They are in direct competition with natural raised beef/bison, and other healthy meats such as wild caught fish, goat, free range local poultry etc...They want to convince the world that good sourced meat and dairy (especially red meat) is bad for you, so they can not just continue to sell their corn derivatives as food to CAFO productions, but even convince people that byproducts like soy meal are suitable for human consumption (rather than animal feed) and mark up the price.  On soy meal btw:  https://www.ilsoyadvisor.com/sites/default/files/images/page/Illinois%20Soybean%20Production%20Guide.pdf  (soy produces an average of 3 yeilds per year compared to corn.)  And what soy meal is (its a bypoduct mostly made for animal feed, but people are trying to market it as a protein replacement these days:)  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soybean_meal#:~:text=Some%2C%20but%20not%20all%2C%20soybean,meal%20contains%20ground%20soybean%20hulls.  &gt;Soybean meal is used in food and animal feeds, principally as a protein supplement, but also as a source of metabolizable energy.   &gt;Some, but not all, soybean meal is produced from the residue left after oil extraction. Removal of the oil, which is used mostly in food, but also for industrial oils, soaps and biodiesel, involves crushing and either pressing or solvent extraction. Some, but not all, soybean meal contains ground soybean hulls. Soybean meal is heat-treated during production, to denature the trypsin inhibitors of soybeans, which would otherwise interfere with protein digestion.[2][3]  So all of this, really is just a marketing scheme.

And what veganism, like a cancerous tumor, attracts people to thinking. They end up bouncing themselves on yo yo diets because they starve themselves past equilibrium, from the very concepts you base your negative self on...are perpetrating social dystopia, not actual fitness.  From what I see with your top posts on your page, is a lot of people conflating low body fat content to health, and posing images as if images = health (which is disturbing as it's mostly women there, who actually need to drop this bs).   If they are losing weight healthily, they're obviously doing the kind of stuff most people can do on any couch to 5k plan, no matter if vegan or not. If they aren't doing it healthily (which I suspect from what I know of the vegan diet and how these progress picks on your website have a very short time span and a big change, or a super long timespan and basically no change....) Their body is consuming their own flesh, they are gonna yo-yo as they've disrupted their thyroid/adrenals/liver.   I was also a high school coach, btw.

You don't have to go vegan to achieve that. In fact what I see mostly from that page is a lot of very insecure people with basically no changes, posing like this guy:  https://www.reddit.com/r/veganfitness/comments/h9a94m/coming_up_on_6_years_vegan_this_august_and_a_few/  and this girl:  https://www.reddit.com/r/veganfitness/comments/halq01/pic_on_the_right_i_posted_on_this_page_back_in/  Cuz they got textbook BD."

JessicaMurawski,2020-06-21 15:21:17,fvjluxz,t3_hd6rpw,t1_fvjllhr,"It’s not to make it difficult for small farmers to distribute. It’s because pasteurized milk is safer than raw milk, and because milk is used for a lot more things than just fluid drinking milk. Not everyone wants full fat milk. Some want skimmed milk and the extra fat can be used in cream and butter making."
nsdap_,2020-06-21 16:16:18,fvjrndb,t3_hd6rpw,t1_fvjluxz,"However it is still an imposition if you sell raw milk you go to jail, there is no freedom in choosing just the state forcing both consumers and producers."
JessicaMurawski,2020-06-21 16:18:54,fvjrxek,t3_hd6rpw,t1_fvjrndb,"I think some states allow raw milk to be sold. I think it should be allowed and be an option, but pasteurizing needs to still happen. Also, there would need to be rules and regulations put in place that would protect farmers if someone got sick. The last thing a farmer needs is someone suing them because they got sick from raw milk."
SullyDuggs,2020-06-21 16:32:18,fvjtdem,t3_hd6rpw,t1_fvjllhr,"Oh man, this is one of those situations that just isn't true. There is a reason that the Inland Empire in So Cal still has dairy farms. It's because milk has been a co-op for decades. Small dairies only have the hurtle to find a brand to sell to. They get the promise of selling regardless of fluctuating demand. Their milk never gets wasted. At times they can be at odds with the cartel but for the most part it keeps them in business. They don't even need to treat the milk themselves. It's a sweet deal and guarantees us high quality milk every day."

Bleu_Cheese_Pursuits,2020-06-21 19:00:32,fvk9v81,t3_hd6rpw,t1_fvjllhr,"In America, it varies by state. For example in NY, you can buy unpasteurized milk but you have to buy it from the farm you get it from. Hopefully it will be deregulated, much in the same way that the beer industry was. 15 years ago, it was impossible to own an operate a small brewery because you had to start of producing a certain amount. Allowing microbreweries to exist permitted a huge boon to the economy, by letting people with lesser means to enter the space. Unfortunately, it did not cause cheaper beer."
Bleu_Cheese_Pursuits,2020-06-21 19:02:44,fvka42u,t3_hd6rpw,t1_fvjrxek,"Why would someone getting sick from drinking bad raw milk be any different than someone getting sick from a rotten apple?

JessicaMurawski,2020-06-21 19:57:40,fvkg7wx,t3_hd6rpw,t1_fvke8b7,You’re comparing apples to oranges. They’re not going to sue the farmer for getting diabetes from a processed grain product. They probably wouldn’t sue anyone because diabetes isn’t an immediate disease. But they would have more reasons to sue a farmer who they directly bought raw milk from if they ended up getting sick.

Cometarmagon,2020-06-22 18:25:46,fvntncs,t3_hdr14x,t1_fvn5eo8,Biologically speaking every human is different. Some people absorb nutrients better from only animal sources and some people need plants to help them along. Human biology is not a 1 fits all type of thing.      Example. Medication. Celexa might work for one person and they have no side effects but give it to someone else and suddenly it makes them worse and they have all the dangerous symptoms.      Example: I can drink milk and eat beef at the same time. I suffer no absorbancy issues what so ever. Some people however can't eat beef and drink milk at the same time as it might effect their ability to absorb nutrition.

There’s so much gate keeping in their conversations not just with veganism but all other topics as well. I was in a Christian club in high school and one session that really stood out what how some Christian groups use the “repent or go to Hell” tactic and how ineffective it is and this is EXACTLY what I see with Veganism. They get so angry at non-vegans for being who they are but if someone doesn’t fully commit to being vegan (their way) it’s asinine. I don’t understand discouraging people the way they do. I’ll happily eat animal products because that’s what I prefer but don’t guilt me.
