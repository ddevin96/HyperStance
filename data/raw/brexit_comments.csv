Edit: There’s been some debate here about the true cost/contribution of the EU to the UK economy. If anyone manages to still give a shit then here is a pretty enlightening [article](https://www.ft.com/content/202a60c0-cfd8-11e5-831d-09f7778e7377) from the FT.   Economists (event pro Brexit ones) say a reasonable estimate suggests economic growth which vastly outweighs any ‘fees’ we have to pay (which in the end turn out to be only net £7bn/yr).

Not a snowball's chance in hell. It would not be even debated as a serious matter and receive no traction. It would be a complete non-starter.  Now I'm not advocating to set the result in stone. It should be challenged, after it is implemented and respected for a reasonable period of time before a new vote is held. The previous time this period was 41 years. Being the generous person that I am I'd say that this time it could be in as few as 10 years after the UK actually leaves, but not three years and without leaving first, that would be a travesty."

What about when the next country threatens Eurozone, but this time it's Italy, many times the size of Greece? What will happen when another million or two of migrants from Africa enter the EU? That's a lot of questions that nobody can answer. And I thought you said remain was not an uncertain option.  I wish you good luck waiting for that leader who will make Labour electable again. I don't think such person has joined Labour yet."

If you're going to point to the flyer which was circulated which stated that 'the result of the vote will be implemented' (or words to that effect) then I'd like to see something a little more tangible than a promise (because that's all it was) made by a past government that has long since lost its mandate. Not to mention I'm sure there are a whole host of 'promises' that past governments have printed on bits of paper and distributed that never saw fruition; I assume you see all those as violations of the democratic process as well? Do you have a list of all those past indiscretions too that you also religiously bleat on about? Considering you're not British I assume the scope of your interest in upholding the 'game' of democracy stretches far beyond the British Isles as well.   Of course, maybe there is some other democratic contract highlighting these rules to the game of democracy you're so fond of referencing, other than that flyer, of which I am unaware of.

It was based on an assumption that a new building would be erected which would be better than the building they currently live in. However, when the wrecking ball arrives some clever clogs asks the question, ""how long until we can move into the new building?"". Nobody can answer that question. Then someone else asks, ""well, what's gonna be so good about the new building that makes it better than this one?"" Nobody can answer that either. Then someone else pipes up and suggests, ""maybe it's best to not knock down the building until those two important questions can be answered"". And then there's Bob that's adamant that the building should be knocked down still. The other 9 people are scratching their head and ask Bob, ""why the hell should we knock down the building?"". Bob answers, ""well we voted to knock down the building"". The other 9 suggest that it's not too late and want to reconsider, unless Bob can come up with a good reason to proceed. Bob responds, ""well if we don't knock this building nobody will trust us when we say we're gonna knock the next building down"".  The other 9 think this is a very silly reason to uproot their lives and be made homeless indefinitely and without any idea of it will even be worth it in the long run. Bob keeps muttering about rules of the game, saving face, saving democracy, living on the street being a worthwhile price to pay for the 'possibility' of a better building.

They legislated for one referendum because without that legislation the referendum wouldn't have been allowed to be held. But where in that legislation does it prevent another referendum from being held. These are the 'rules' you so dogmatically refer to so very often, so I'm assuming you could point me to the legislation which makes having another referendum against these 'rules'.   If I have one chocolate bar am I automatically barred from having another?  &gt;It was not only a flyer but a series of consecutive governments and PMs who made Brexit their core goal in the manifesto they stood on.

I'm assuming you have a long list of every government the world over who ever reneged on their manifestos, see as you're so hot on upholding democracy outside of your own nation. I wasn't aware that a manifesto was a legally binding document. Less aware that people's expectations were able to legally hold the government to account.   No offence but just because you keep talking about 'rules of the game' doesn't mean there are any. At least not in the inclination you use.

If parliament wanted to legislate for another referendum now that could. The initial legislation did not preclude them from do so. Just because they haven't and likely won't doesn't mean that they can't. Which is very different from what you have said on many many occasions now.

How do the people hold a government to account *politically* for not fulfilling their manifesto. I know this one... They vote. Yet here you are saying that a second referendum would be against the 'rules of the game'. Rules that you cannot demonstrate exist anywhere but your head. Forgive me for finding this tragically amusing.   &gt;Like with Brexit benefits just because you keep rejecting them all does not mean they don't exist.

Scots have made a big contribution to everything we call British: in science and technology, in the military, in medicine, in architecture, in banking and insurance, and so on.  As regards the European Union, I've spent most of my adult life controlled by an unelected Commission that sends its ""policies"" to a so-called Parliament; which then nods them through with hardly any debate.  This Common Agricultural Policy is designed to protect the outdated inefficient French land inheritance and usage system.  The Fisheries Policy is designed to provide cheap fish in countries with no coastline, such as Austria; resulting in the destruction of North Sea fish stocks.  And so on, and so on.  These overpaid Commissioners are running the show with no regard to the long term benefit of member countries, or the environment,  or the living conditions of ""ordinary"" people.  Just their own wealth and that of their corporate/financial/ideological supporters. I expect no personal or financial benefits from Brexit, but believe that my children and grandchildren will be able to control their own lives, and enjoy the freedoms for which Britain used to be famous."

If all the taxes paid by the bankers went into paying back that debt, it would still take them 20 years to get it back to 2007 levels.   And along with bankers in New York, London's bankers were responsible for the 2008 disaster. Those were the world's two largest financial capitals in the world, by a mile. A lot of the debt was created by the government literally bailing out banks with taxpayers' money.   Also, it's important to remember that the City of London hires a lot of Britain's best technical graduates. If they weren't working for the banks, they would be working somewhere else - most likely in high-tech industries. So they would still be making a huge contribution to UK GDP.   Thirdly, bear in mind that countries like Austria, Germany and Sweden are richer than the British...even if they don't have legions of Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan guys strutting around their cities.   Finally, remember the social costs. It's actually not much fun living in a country in which 27-year-olds get paid [£200,000 a year] (https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/money-diary-finance-200k). It looks unjust at pretty much every level.   So I would be careful what you wish for."

MinTamor,2020-01-13 14:53:19,fe8klji,t3_eo1vy2,t1_fe8dfzz,"I know. I have friends who make more than £1 million a year in the City.   I'm not saying these are all evil people (tho some are). But it's madness to over-specialise the British economy in something this un-productive.   Bankers don't actually *produce* anything. There's a reasonable argument that what they do shouldn't even count towards GDP. GDP's supposed to measure final consumption, not intermediate goods. Finance is an intermediate good.  There's a discussion of this [here] (http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/Akritidis2007.pdf), if you're interested.  Football players at least entertain people. Bankers don't even do that.   Moreover, many City bankers are German, French, Italian, American etc. When they retire, they take their millions home with them (as is their right and is perfectly sensible for them to do so). Hell, even many British bankers retire to France. If you've got loads of money, why live here? So their money doesn't even necessarily stay in the UK economy.   Also worth noting that despite the City of London, Britain still runs service deficits on trade with both Germany and France.   And without wishing to be too glib about it, £29 billion a year in tax isn't all that much. The UK's net payments to the EU are £10 billion a year.   Also bear in mind that the City of London is expensive to maintain. Not just the enormous bailouts, but taxpayers have to pay the salaries of legions of judges who are specialists in obscure financial matters...a huge financial watchdog to stop them committing the crimes bankers so often try to commit...vast amounts of airport infrastructure so they can jet about the world....and the costs for everyone else of bankers bidding-up the supply of available property, making it unaffordable for other workers.    This very rarely gets admitted by anyone. But occasionally, it does. Note this [opaque little comment] (https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/811308/Brexit-Merkel-City-Of-London-Finance-Brussels-Juncker-Frankfurt-jobs) by the City of London's ""envoy"" to the EU, about Germany's lack of enthusiasm when it comes to stealing London's business:   &gt; There's quite a lot of scepticism in Germany about how successful they want Frankfurt to be. When I go to Frankfurt, they're quite enthusiastic about the Frankfurt option; when I go to Berlin, they're not quite so enthusiastic. This is because this is actually quite a burden for the British government and the British taxpayer to stand behind this massive financial centre.  Hence why Sheffield University recently [concluded] (http://speri.dept.shef.ac.uk/2018/10/05/uk-finance-curse-report/) banking was a massive net drain on the British economy.  I don't know how much the current British government understands any of this. But if they do (and Boris Johnson used to be mayor of London but has since lost interest in winning its votes) then the Brexit negotiations this year could go horribly wrong.   Because, like you, I think the EU sees financial services access as some sort of negotiating trump card.   Whereas if the Conservative government understands the points I've made above, that card will be worth next to nothing.  EDIT: One French study suggests that the contribution of banking to France's GDP was overestimated by [as much as 74%] (https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01254475)."

It also doesn't include variable overheads such as uniforms, CPD or any of the other things that extra nurses require to do their jobs.  Also, you can't throw another 50,000 nurses into the system without the management structure and back-office support (finance, payroll, occupational health, HR, facilities management etc) which also costs money.

Textile? good luck competing to bangladesh where people live on 100$ a month. cars? nissan and toyota will relocate into europe, what cars britain produce apart from jaguar? aerospace? they won't survive with a closed border. the famous fish industry? it's basically irrelevant. Tourism? who honestly choses to spend its holidays in the UK over Italy, Spain, or France, expecially now that you need a passport to visit the country?  At that point if your idea is to make your products more competitive you could aswell get a paycut.  &gt;Hi-tech manufacturers will have a better chance of hiring good graduates if they have less competition from the banks.  but with a lower pound good graduates are more likely to leave and go search better pay and better opportunities in other countries. Why work for Jaguar if you can make better moneys at BMW?  &gt;And we can sign trade deals with countries that actually *want* to buy our products, rather than with the French and Germans, who wouldn't buy a Jaguar or a Land Rover if we were selling them for 1 euro.  that's not how you sell Jaguars. Jaguars aren't cheap, they're luxury cars, the average jaguar buyer has moneys to spend, so you don't sell them undercutting BMW or Audi, you sell them making them more desirable than bmw and audi. And trust me if nobody wants a jaguar now nobody will want it after brexit even if it's cheaper.Also cars production doesn't happen in a single factory, they send and subcontracts parts all over europe. Guess what, without just in time deliveries ( due to the closed border ) and without cheap parts made abroad producing a single jaguar will probably cost more after brexit than before brexit, so you won't even be able to really make them competitive.  &gt;Even though a Jaguar's just been named European Car of the Year.  guess what? the market doesn't really care about those awards, those awards are basically self masturbation for manufacturers.

We can also reduce tariffs on things like oranges and wine, which are subject to EU protectionism.

But if you plan to export them into the EU cause maybe you grow lots of things you don't consume and want at the same time import things you consume, then you can't use OGM cause EU won't import food that is not up to their standards.  and second, now that you have so much  OGM food grown, who will pick it?  &gt;We can also reduce tariffs on things like oranges and wine, which are subject to EU protectionism. This makes life cheaper for us, so we have more money to invest elsewhere.  that doesn't make life cheaper, brexit has already costed you more moneys that you would have paid to stay in the EU, wich by definition isn't cheaper, and also remember that part of your plan was to devalue the pound, so you're already poorer, wich means that probably the things you'll import even with lower tariffs will cost more or the same as before but with lower quality.    honestly, what you say seems reasonable as long as you don't try to make it work in reality, then you kinda realize it's just a collection of nonsense feed to people in order to make them buy brexit."

In fact, I suspect the chunk of the British economy sustained by London's bankers is actually larger than the headline figures.   But even so, it doesn't spread their wealth much beyond London and the Home Counties. Banks don't need a network of suppliers and factories in places like South Wales and North Yorkshire. At most, it's a few data centres here and there, and the odd back-office with low-level clerical staff.   Compare this to the German mittelstand, a vast network of suppliers that distributes the wealth generated by Germany's manufacturing specialism across a wide swathe of Germany.   London's bankers keep London's restaurants pretty flush, and a lot of extension builders, and strip clubs and coke dealers. But the opera and ballet get subsidised by John Q Sucker Taxpayer, so does the state-owned Transport for London, while the rest of the country has to make do with crummy privatised trains and buses.     So the wealth London generates doesn't even cascade out as far as places like Leigh-on-Sea and Rochester. Banking concentrates wealth in a few hands, which also helps explain why the UK has some of the [worst inequality rates] (https://data.oecd.org/inequality/income-inequality.htm) in the EU."

You're lucky enough to have been born in a country where you don't need to learn a foreign language to go and work wherever you want and you believe that it's all a conspiracy because the rest of the world want to come and steal your jobs?

I've heard the u.s.a. are building a wall cause all the mexicans that go there to do temporary jobs legally never go back when their visa expire and they prefer to stay there as illegals than to go back home, but i'm sure that won't be a problem in the uk, right?  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;and protectionist policies that make us buy expensive produce from Europe that we could import more cheaply from elsewhere.  again.

In two years, when the pound will be devalued, and you won't have tariffs, you think you'll pay less that orange? You'll buy cheaper lowest quality oranges  with a weaker pound form countries that won't be able to sell you their oranges at lower prices or they'll have to sell them for the same price to the EU ( because they have trade deals, you know ), in the end you'll end up paying oranges the same, if you're lucky, while everything else will cost more.  There's no way around it, you'll be poorer and most of what you're saying doesn't make sense. But i'm sure was enough to convince you to vote leave. Please remember to blame it on the EU or on labour when brexit won't turn out as the paradise you envisioned, that's definitely their fault somehow, and never think for a moment the blame is yours for being gullible and misinformed."

For you, learning English was a no-brainer (not because of the British, I hasten to add, but because of the Americans).   wait a minute, it seems to me you're moving the goal posts as you please.    1st, it can't be a no brainer for me, cause i would have the very same problems that you have moving in any of the other 27 countries minus the uk. It's not that if i move to Siemens for me english is enough but for your friend is not.   If it's a no brainer for me it's an even more no brainer for you since you speak that language by default.   2nd -Also it seems to me your friend was hired by Siemens ( you say he works for siemens ), therefore english is enough to get you a job, i guess it's a given that if i'm hired and i'm planning to stay in the company i'll eventually have to learn the language but at least i'm in. if I send a curriculum telling them i only speak polish, or romanian, or spanish, they wouldn't probably even read it.

He is a naturally talented linguist. Many people are not.   Likewise, I have other friends who work in Munich. They also learnt to speak good German (at university) before they got jobs out there.   I don't really understand why they had a burning passion to live in Germany - I like the place, and I like the Germans who I know personally, but I didn't grow up dreaming of living there and wanting to speak their beautiful [joke] language."

Now bear in mind I’m no economist but I’m convinced that membership of the EU also contributes to our economy in other ways that are much harder to measure.  For example, I studied at a university of art and design which received grants from the EU. Im pretty sure this is not the only example of the EU funding the growth of the British creative sector. The creative industry is now very large and successful in the UK and brings a lot of money into the country. Membership of the EU also doubtlessly makes it easier for these companies to find European customers.  This is of course one example of millions of factors. Another I can think of the contribution of EU national workers (with the south to north brain drain etc). We also cooperated with them in innumerable ways when it came to things you don’t even usually think of like shared use of intelligence satellites which has a different kind of value. I personally consider freedom of movement and mixing of cultures to be a virtue in itself which enriches the world in a way you can’t put a number on. I myself have lived on the continent for five years.   The counter argument is of course that certain industries have suffered from the EU in similarly unmeasurable ways, like North Sea fishing.  Like I say, it’s hard to put a number on it but the gap between our financial contributions to the EU and the post Brexit losses from the calculator is rapidly closing. With that my guess is, definitely by now, on balance the EU had been a positive contribution to our economy and lives.  The British public has been learning the hard way recently about the complexity of the relationship we have had with the EU so let’s not be so simplistic as to try and put it in terms of ‘net contribution/returns’ like this.  Someone somewhere must have written something informative in layman’s terms about this. Where can I find this stuff?"

I'll admit I thought they would refuse the many requests for extensions just to screw the UK, but they've been a lot more calm and reasonable than many in the UK.  Hell, I enjoyed brexiteers screaming ""fascists"" when the EU suggested ""remainers"" needed to be more mature and keep their rude tshirt slogans out of the EU parliament."

chris-za,2020-01-14 08:15:00,fecycy8,t3_eohud5,t1_fecvyym,"&gt;That’s why it’s called a “transition” period.  And I suspect that the EU would be happy if the UK could tell them, what exactly it wants to transition to? Johnson still wants an open border into the EU (in Ireland) and closed borders to the EU everywhere else. Have his cake and eat it... The EU will never agree to internal borders as it defeats the purpose of the EU.  It was supposed to be some kind of implementation period following a month or so for the Withdrawal Agreement and a year or so for a copy and paste Norway style trade deal. Alas, while the EU was ready, the UK has been involved on domestic squabbling and feet dragging...  So the ""transition period"" will more like a negotiating period where the parties decide about what they want to transition to and negotiate the details. 2-3 years is being optimistic. If the UK keep up its modus operandi, 5-10 is more realistic to know where we're going.  And then, I expect it to be followed by 1-2 years of what is likely to be called an ""implementation period"" in the trade deal."

It wasn't stable under May and I can see a number of things destroying the current happiness. On the other hand, looking across the pond, the Republicans appear to be perfectly happy basking in power and the orange reflection of their glorious leader and follow him wherever he leads them, even it's complete chaos. I always expected there to be more responsible people among the Republicans than there actually are. I might be equally disappointed by the current Tory bunch.  So I guess everything is possible at the moment, from the government imploding within a year to serving the whole term.  Don't also forget to consider the current PM being reelected at the next GE, similar to Trump getting a second isn't completely unrealistic.

Likewise if Labour won Tory voters would have to accept Corbyn. Not necessarily agree with him but accept him and Labour as duly elected for the next term.

Tory MPs have moved to the right while the Tory electorate moved to the left.

barryvm,2020-01-14 09:26:09,fed1i0c,t3_eohud5,t3_eohud5,"It's much worse than that: for the foreseeable future, the EU will make laws and decisions that affect the UK, but the UK will have no say in it.  After Brexit, the EU will not magically vanish in a puff of smoke, and neither will its influence. The UK will find itself on the doorstep of a much larger political bloc that it depends on for about half of its trade. That bloc will handle all its foreign economic (trade treaties) and most of its political business (cooperation treaties) as a unified whole. It also has the explicit political mandate to maintain control over its internal market, on which the UK depends, through regulation and judicial control. UK companies, and even the UK government, will have no choice but to either follow EU regulations and standards, or lose access to the EU market. No free trade agreement will ever change that, because if it did then such an agreement would not be in the EU's interest and would not get approved.  In short, Brexit is not ""taking back control"", it's ""losing real power and influence in return for the illusion of control"". The brutal truth is that ever since the second world war only a super power could exert meaningful control over its environment. The UK is not a super power any more and has not been one since the late 19th century. The European Union is a concerted effort to pool the economic and political resources of 28/27 small and medium sized countries to reach a point where it can exert that control and project power to safeguard its members' interests. So far, it has largely succeeded at that and there is no reason why it would not continue to succeed in the future. Meanwhile, the UK has a simple choice: become a satellite state of either the EU or the USA, depending on which regulatory and diplomatic system it wants to accept. So far, the UK government seems to move toward the latter."

It's not as if the EU (and presumably every trade expert in the UK as well) has not made this clear from day one.  &gt; Mr Roberts said: “We need government to back British farming like never before and put in place the right policies so dairy businesses can continue doing what they do best – providing great tasting, traceable and affordable food for the nation.”  Even the best possible free trade agreement can not give you frictionless trade, so what are they asking the UK government to do here?"

An extension would not only mean changing the withdrawal agreement, and thus requiring unanimous consent, but also require an agreement on UKs contributions to the EU budget as well as a (significantly) revised EU budget.   There is a reason for the july deadline to request an extension as well as the chosen december 2020 ending period;  it coincides with EUs 7 year financial framework 2014-2020, which ends in december and a new one needs to be negotiated this year. That will be tough enough as it is. Im not saying its impossible if the UK asks an extension in august, but a last minute complete overhaul of the EUs next 7 year budget planning, thats just not gonna happen."

But I wonder where they are going to find an export market then: the EU will (as you stated) put tariffs on British produce to protect their own farmers. The USA has a much more industrialized, larger scale and deregulated agriculture that will undercut UK farmers in their home market if they sign an FTA with the USA. Other markets without strong import controls have much lower labour costs, so UK farmers will require increased subsidies to compete.  I really can't see any upside to any of this."

Democracy is an ongoing debate, the attempt to silence those who disagree with you is what de-legitimizes results. Over the last 10 years in the US we have seen people protesting ""not my president"" and the like, where does this come from? It comes from the attempt to silence those on the losing side of the presidential elections and those people then respond by de-legitimizing the result.   There is no requirement for remainers to accept the implementation of the advisory referendum. There is no reason to accept having your rights removed as an EU citizen nor to being made poorer as a UK one.  In all likelihood the UK will rejoin the EU. Once the UK is out the economic consequences will set in. Bojo will probably get 10 years to wreck the UK but by the end he will be out and the UK back in some point after."

Europe, and that includes the UK is very densely populated. As a result real estate, that would be farms as well, are more expensive than they are for competitors.  The only way to find upsides would be either to just continue as is (and be happy about blue passports as the up side), or to get the EU to give them money for nothing / have their cake and eat it, as promised by Brexiteers.  If Brexiteers can't hold their promises (and, spoiler, they can't and never really had a chance to. They lied and they knew it.

You are the one saying that a second referendum is illegal, against the 'rules of the game' but is unable to point to anything that back this assertion up. Illegal means it is against the law and as such legislated for. But as I think I've clearly shown, no such law exists. Hence the possibility of another referendum is not illegal. All it would require would be legislation (the same kind that the 2016 legislation required) to make it happen.   You chess analogy is shit. Sorry. But the rules of chess are clearly laid out and universally agreed upon so that people the world over can play the game to a standardised set of rules. Politics IS NOT A GAME (something you seem to struggle to comprehend). It is fluid and the dynamics of it change depending on many facets. Is it illegal to have a referendum on whether Monday should be part of the weekend? No. Why? Because nothing in law says it's illegal to have a referendum on this topic. On your logic every referendum must have already been agreed in principle before it's conception. Something which is impossible without a time machine. By that logic the 2016 referendum was 'against the rules' because it hadn't been legislated for before the WA act 2015.   No offence but I really don't want to waste my time with someone who is so entrenched in their position that they are willing make up complete fallacies to solidify their position just to save their ego from having to deal with the consequence of being wrong.   I wish you the best in your life but please refrain from peddling half truths under the guise of caring for democracy when you clearly don't have any interest in any other democratic process or injustice anywhere in the world but the UK, somewhere you don't seem to have vested interest.

The government and civil service can do only things they are allowed to do by legislation, unlike ordinary citizens who can do anything that is not prohibited by legislation.  Talking to the opposition is what governments do and what they should do. It is in no way similar to asserting that one's opinion is supreme over others' and that a new referendum should be held at the expense of 17.4 million people and the pending result they voted for and still expect to be implemented."

SlantViews,2020-01-14 12:36:00,feda5me,t3_eojtmp,t1_fed9d9q,"Education, education, education. A democracy can only work if the people can make an informed decision. Most people think it's enough to let them decide, but the key is that they have to be well informed before making them decide.  The lies in the Press are easy enough to see through from people all over Europe, because they are usually able to read at least two sets of linguistic news sources, their own native press and the British one. Three, if you include the US, Canada, Australia and whoever else publisehs in English.  The British, however, limit themselves to just one language. They have barely an idea what is written in France, Germany and Italy. And they have no interest in finding out, because the average Briton actually, truly believes that England is the centre of the world. This is not hyperbole, this has crystallized in the past three years. Even remainers are having a really hard time letting it go often enough. The few that do instantly swing to the other extreme and talk about England as if it's already third world. I am not sure if that is genuine or the typical British tendency to either rule the waves or make fun of themselves to ease the tension. Either way, I don't think the idea that come a fortnight, Lithuania has more power over this whole business than the English do has permeated the British perception, yet.  Yes, I said it. Lithuania. The British press never analysed and talked about the power imbalance that Britain is subjecting itself to with Brexit. They never acknowledged that in this dog-eat-dog world, Britain is going to be one of the small fish in the future, while the EU, USA, China are going to be the whales deciding global politics. England may talk big, but everyone on this planet sees what's happening. Do you think just 50 years ago Australia would have casually dismissed the English request for easing of visa restrictions?  All of this is happening because the British are bombarded with propaganda and they cannot use common sense to tell lie apart from truth. So in the end, they reject all of it. The lies and the truth. And they claim that everyone is lying, even the well meaning people that try to help them with advice. That is a dumb person's response. That's someone who is not well educated being frightened into rejecting any movement. And being too afraid to realise that they were manipulated into being afraid.  The biggest strategy of these populists? They create an artificial fear (immigration) to get into charge, and once they're in charge they do some token measures that achieve jack shit and pretend they solved the problem (immigration). They can do that, because the problem never really existed. It's the simplest con, it's really easy to check the numbers and see for yourself. But people fall for it all the time, because fear makes them irrational."

I assume it will be done in 11 month's time.  What I mean is that even once you leave, all your companies and people that do business with the EU will still need to follow their applicable laws and decisions if you want to continue doing business with them.  Hypothetical example: You decide to adopt some of the less stringent US rules regarding your food.  The EU suddenly won't say ""Oh, OK, go ahead and send us food we don't allow our own manufacturers/farmers to sell"".  If you want access to the EU, your largest, closest trading partner, then you will abide by EU rules.  Concrete example: In the US we have some states that just don't seem to give a damn about air quality and pollution. They have littler to no standards for what filth a car can spit out.   California, however, has incredibly strict standards.  So, guess what literally every major manufacturer does here?  They make cars that adhere to the California standards.  It would take you forever to go to a Toyota, Honda, Ford, Nissan, BMW, whatever car lot and find anything that doesn't meet California's standards.  It's simply not economically feasible for manufacturers to manufacturer cars that can be sold in California and cars that can't. The marketplace and economics don't allow for that.   So all those plants outside of California are still following California's rules, they just don't get any vote.  You will find yourself in a very similar situation with the EU. To do business with them at the scale you do today, you'll adhere tot heir rules and regulations.  You just won't have a vote."

I spoke to many mature Brits and thay all live under illusion that UK is well respected and influential internationally. The spin that was installing this thought came after wwii, but became a  sweet lie when the downfall of an empire was spinned through Commonwealth. While losing the influence, UK did not do bad over the years, and did have respect, but EU was doing better. The sheer lack of social policies created one of the poorest working and middle classes in Europe. North of England has 5/10 poorest cities in Europe. On top of this poverty, the spin of great importance and influence was served throughout generations up to the point when people actually believed it. ''EU making policies we don't like, EU compromising on policies we propose, EU enforcing rules we don't like''. All these arguments by leavers have one thing in common: ''We think we could run things better, beacuse we are so strong, influential, capable and respected''. Brexit resonated with people who did not have much to lose and whose whole life was made of limitations and compromises, calling them ignorant or racist is wrong, these are just people who are collateral damage of bad social governing over the years and who projected the blame to EU instead on their own country who manipulated them. Brexit will ironically hit them the hardest, but it will also heavily hit the remainers. It's a lose lose situation and with it, you also lost international respect  that you actually had. We all know that rich will be unaffected.   The sad thing is that I wouldn't be surprised if government spins this as the best decision in history and masks the reality as was done with Commonwealth. The difference will however be, that loss of colonies did not affect your lifestyle and living standard, but backing out from free trade deal with your massive neighbor of 400 million will have dire consequences, and those in the middle and below will need to pay for the damage."

This is why I think the government is going to try this ""stop talking about brexit"" thing, I think it will work. I think just telling brexit supporters we have brexit will be enough. Remember that before 2015 less than 5% of people cared about Europe in polls on things they cared about in politics. The government is hoping we'll go back to that, and I suspect we will. The idea of brexit, just simply feeling brexit has happened, thats enough for most leavers."

When you undertake important things, in the world of tech or business or engineering, you set up measures, metrics, ways of seeing if a thing you undertake has been a success. Then you do the thing, and check the measures.  So, what are the measures of brexit? You shouldn't do a thing unless you can measure whether it was a success. There should be goals - by doing brexit we'll achieve X or we'll be able to do Y. Then you measure those things."

You're missing the fact that the EU has made the situation worse. Consider the following:   1999: [Anger as UK blocks EU tax] (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/541502.stm)  2009: [UK blocks Europe's efforts to take charge of bank reform] (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/ditch-the-directive/6388803/UK-blocks-Europes-efforts-to-take-charge-of-bank-reform.html)  2011: [David Cameron: EU 'constant attacks' on City of London - BBC News] (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15487674)  2011: [Tory Party funding from City doubles under Cameron] (https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2011-02-08/tory-party-funding-from-city-doubles-under-cameron)  2014: [David Cameron to demand EU treaty reform to 'save' City of London] (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/15/cameron-to-demand-eu-treaty-reform)  2014: [Europe rejects UK's financial transaction tax challenge] (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-27218615)  2016: [UK regulators say won't apply EU bonus cap to all banks] (https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-britain-banks-bonuses-idUKKCN0W21ID)   2017: [EU adopts tax haven blacklist, British territories spared] (https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-eu-ecofin-tax/eu-adopts-tax-haven-blacklist-british-territories-spared-idUKKBN1DZ28O)  2018: [Hammond to reassure bankers in speech he will protect them in Brexit] (https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-economy/hammond-to-reassure-bankers-in-speech-he-will-protect-them-in-brexit-idUKKBN1JG3DV?rpc=401&amp;)  Now, you would probably argue that this shows that the EU has been trying to regulate the bankers, and that it's the British who have repeatedly blocked this.   But in that case, *what's the point of being in the EU*??    Being in the EU just means that Tory/New Labour governments spend their entire time protecting London's bankers in Brussels, while letting the rest of the UK economy go to shit.   Worse, they've done deals to protect other countries' Evil Corporations, in exchange for them protecting our Evil Bankers. Such as when Cameron [did a deal] (https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/britain-and-germany-in-secret-pact-to-defy-eu-laws-l50hpgkxw3z) with Merkel to protect Germany's Dieselgate crooks, in exchange for Germany protecting London's banker crooks.   In what way is this system remotely of benefit to ordinary people, either in Britain or Germany? We get gassed to death by VW while having our economy shredded by London's bankers...  ...and none of them ever get punished because the EU system produces dirty little deals like the one above.   It's also why no one can improve the EU's shit system of farm subsidies, or the way small countries act as tax havens inside the EU. Just like the Brits protect the bankers and the Germans protect the diesel-poisoners, so the French protect the Common Agricultural Policy and the Irish protect Apple, Google and the other American companies that dodge taxes in Dublin.   Who on earth can defend this shitshow?"

Dutchlawyer,2020-01-14 18:57:32,fee7xue,t3_eopl6u,t3_eopl6u,"In case it gets stuck behind a paywall:  &gt; By John Ellidge &gt;  &gt; There’s a 1988 Doctor Who story in which the Doctor and his companion Ace land on a planet with an authoritarian regime obsessed with eliminating sadness by, essentially, killing anyone who experiences it. &gt;  &gt; This story – which is called The Happiness Patrol, and whose villain, played by Sheila Hancock, is ever so slightly reminiscent of a certain Tory prime minister – keeps popping into my head as I watch some of the more deranged pageantry of Brexit. The government has already minted two batches of commemorative 50p coins, and last month ordered a third, despite the fact that the first two had to be melted down because events in parliament meant that they featured the wrong exit date. But this week there have been two more stories suggesting that Brexit is doing something very, very odd to this country. &gt;  &gt; The less ridiculous one first. Martin Green, the director of Festival 2022 – more commonly, if upsettingly, known as the festival of Brexit – has given his first interview since being handed control of its £120m budget. &gt;  &gt; It’s a reasonably sensible interview, to be fair, in which Green does his best to play down the Brexit angle and talks mostly about how the arts can bring a divided nation together. But his suggestion it could provide “a bit of joy and hope and happiness” has still led the NME to suggest that the festival “strikes a sour note” – not least because Brexit is going to utterly stuff British musicians by requiring them to sort out a vast quantity of expensive paperwork every time they want to gig across the channel. &gt;  &gt; BrexFest is as nothing, however, compared to today’s big story. The bells of Big Ben have been silent for some time, on the not unreasonable grounds that construction workers are repairing the tower and if the bell was going off every fifteen minutes they’d all end up deaf. (I say this is “not unreasonable”; this did not stop the Telegraph from wasting the summer of 2017 campaigning to keep the bell ringing for no immediately comprehensible reason.) &gt;  &gt; But some people are very, very upset about this, for some reason. They’ve been demanding the bell should ring at 11pm on 31 January to celebrate Britain’s freedom. &gt;  &gt; And, in what looks like a transparent attempt to shut them up, our glorious leader has suggested we crowdfund it. “The bongs cost £500,000,” Boris Johnson told the BBC, “but we’re working up a plan so people can” (I’m so sorry about the rest of this sentence) “bung a bob for a Big Ben bong”. Half a million quid to replace the bell’s clapper for one occasion? Be a fool not to. &gt;  &gt; It doesn’t feel like the government is serious about this – no such crowd-funder exists and there isn’t that long to arrange one – so perhaps crowd-funding is the new “cross-party commission”, a way of chucking something into the long grass. But nonetheless, how have we got to the point where the actual Prime Minister would think it was okay to say that sentence out loud where actual people might actually hear him? &gt;  &gt; The vast majority of Remainers, even those who spent the last three and a bit years plotting to overturn the referendum result, have now accepted that Britain will absolutely, definitely leave the European Union at the end of this month. We lost. For now, at least, it’s over. But is it just me, or is there something ever so slightly sinister about the fact that we’re now expected to be happy about it?"

segovius,2020-01-14 20:38:00,feei8hr,t3_eopl6u,t1_feeh9gd,"So now you change your argument from 'not aligning with thinking' to comparisons between the two examples. Which is? Can't be both.   Either you are arguing that it is merely a case of *something politically aligning with someone else's thinking* or you are arguing that Brexit is not in any way bad and people shouldn't complain about it.   If it's the first one then my point stands... if it's the second one that you changed the goalposts to then surely your point is even more erroneous: people oppose Brexit *precisely because* for them it is very bad.   I know people who have already lost large sums of money and others who shortly will. I myself have lost roughly 40% of my professional clients - these represent around 65% of my European clients.   Which is why people oppose it: the will of people who have nothing to do with Europe, never go there and in no way do business or live there, has been allowed to over-rule those who do and those people have to pay for it. Literally in many cases.   So yeah, I don't feel persecuted. But I do feel some Nationalist morons with a hard-on for Empire get to jerk-off to their fantasies and I have to pay with my livelihood for them to do it. And probably have to clean up afterwards too. So yeah, there's that."

After all, if you can trick everyone into thinking they got what they wanted, and avoid the reality train from hitting home, they can claim they got brexit done and project fear was all a hoax and they should get elected again!  On the EU side, it might be fine too. It avoids actually going through with it and having to deal with the economic fallout, while simultaneously they no longer have to worry about British meps throwing wobblies etc. They get the benefits of having the UK with none of the drawbacks.  Ironically, this transition deal really does kind of turn us into a vassal state for 11 months, potentially longer. We're affected by laws we get no say in. If being part of the EU and getting a say is not sovereignty then this transition is surely surrendering a great deal of sovereignty lmao."

You replied, '*How does turning your back on the Ode to Joy  increase or decrease your knowledge of European history*'.   It's all there very clear.   OP used the word 'have'; as in they already 'have' a comprehension of European history, albeit possibly limited. In no amount of words did OP say that at the moment their backs were being turned did that action have any effect on increasing or decreasing knowledge of European history.

I can understand though, not knowing the ins and outs as an American. There are reasons beyond xenophobia, though remainers like to express that the heart of the brexiteer logic is a hatred / fear of Europe and Europeans / or foreigners in general. I’m not an objective commentator in this discussion, but from my own perspective, I don’t think every pro-leave argument is related to xenophobia. many, but not all may be. Of course, you can disagree depending on what you think classifies xenophobia.   I will give you one example that I think you can relate to. I would compare it briefly, but not majorly to your own country. With your own country, as a federation I understand you have had certain states attempt secession from the federation, on account of wanting full autonomy. The United States, to my understanding with its manifest destiny, expanded into the North American continent and accumulated the 50 states over time which were created when each ratified the constitution and agreed to all of its parts. Those states were only ever a part of America (Apart from Alaska). I think there’s a strong case in considering the variety of ways nationhood is defined, and in America’s case, being more a nation built on the presence and slow mixing together and inclusion of many different European ethnicities in the country’s history, and of course groups coming from outside Europe, particularly the slaves of British plantation owners, turned American plantation owners. (I don’t want to get into a debate about that). I think it’s clear Americans, whatever state they live in, call themselves Americans, feel part of a largely homogeneous nation of people who also call themselves Americans, and a country that has a shared history. Those are key factors in nationhood and besides those reasons, I’m sure there are more you could offer, or you can disagree with my summary of how America came to be today.  I want to emphasise the point that this is not the case in Europe. There is a massive and separate discussion you could have about what defines a nation in Europe - the modern European nations themselves all mostly went through a process of uniting small geographical regions together into a nation state, or even that one dominant region imposed a union on less powerful regions and called it a nation state for sake of homogeneity (Prussia In Germany, Madrid in Spain, many expansions by individual regions of France over time, etc etc). Despite this, my own personal opinion is that the European countries of today and what they grew from, feel distinct and home to citizens that identify themselves as, for example British, or French, or German. I can’t say I’m not oversimplifying it but It would be a very long post if I did talk about every exceptional case. There are arguments you could make against my opinion about this, but I just want to focus on the argument for now.  Euroskepticism (the critical perspective of the European Union) expresses the unwanted, and unsanctioned move towards a Federation of European states, like the United States. Now, in Europe and obviously the U.K., certain people feel paranoia about a federation of European states being The end goal of the EU. A few of the mechanisms introduced are almost undeniably a confirmation of that fact. For instance, a monetary union with a European central bank, an area of no border control and free movement; the Schengen area. the makings of a federal authority (like in the US) that has its own court and primacy (in the majority of cases where the laws it has introduced clash with the laws of national authority ruling on the same sector), the suggestion of, In the close future(although its not tangible or even a unanimous position within the EU) a European army, perhaps to act together, above, or as a replacement for national armies. On this fact, there is a European maritime force, though its not a standing force and the force still consists of troops and equipment contributed by individual nations, rather than just being (property of the Force) as a European convention. If you have heard of Nigel Farage, he’s called it a European navy although that is obviously a widely misrepresented fact. Obviously, beyond that, people feel that areas of policy that only the EU rules on (rather than sharing with national governments), such as customs policy, trade policy, competition policy, monetary policy, marine laws, are more evidence of the EU re-directing these authorities of National governments into a federal bureaucracy.   I want to say that These policies have had tangible and great benefits for the majority of nations with the EU. For myself, and others, even despite these benefits, we are concerned by how the EU has been shifting increasingly towards actions consistent with trying to establish a Federation. I personally feel a Federation could never serve localities as well as their current national governments, and feel so connected to Britain as a nation, were to merely become a state that follows a pre-determined policy by a president, and could only make a partial amount of its own laws, I wouldn’t feel represented or included at all. Pro-Federation Remainers have started calling themselves “Europeans” just to piss off people who recognise Britain as a distinct and separate but co-operative nation when compared to the rest of Europe. I recognise that certain groups within the EU want to believe that a Federation is necessary for European nations to compete with the likes of America and China, but serving localities in how they need is what I think is more important. I hope that gives you some idea of a non-xenophobic argument about leaving the EU."

A people with a shared culture, language, religion and most importantly one supreme narrative on history. It is not impossible to have a national where some of this may not be true, but it becomes impossibly difficult to have a strong sense of nationhood.   If a strong national identity does not exist, during times of stress people will always revert to their core identities. Be it religious identity (Middle East), ethnic (east/west Pakistan) or both (Balkans).   To circle back to why people feel the EU is undemocratic i think they actually mean the EU is illegitimate (as least that is how I feel). For a democracy to function the entire electorate needs to be able to self identify with all the other parts of the electorate. If you don’t see yourself in others in a democracy it means civil unrest and resentment.   It took hundreds of years, lots of killing and oppression to create “England” from Mercia, Wessex, etc. Hundreds more years and more blood to create a “British” identity.  There is no European nation or European identity. (Western) Europe hasn’t had a common identity since the reformation. Any bureaucracy in Brussels that tries to rule over so many different peoples is an Empire in all but name. The bullets in the OP listing the “democratic” mechanisms in the EU are nothing but parlour tricks.

I think you ought to remember though that when you say “British” identity, you may be seen to be ignoring obviously distinct Scottish and Welsh identities with their own culture, history and ethnicity, funnily enough. Scottish identity never merged with English identity, it’s institutions did. I’d also make the case that there has never been a common Western European identity, ever. The process you have described in the making of British nationhood was equally apparent on the continent. The French homeland was a patchwork of regions being constantly expanded into by one emergent empire or another, the Spanish regions came under the imposition of Madrid (that continues today), The unification process of Germany was started essentially by the Prussian militaristic state which inspired a great deal of Germany’s militarism in the first and second world wars. There are many examples of imposed nationhood of one region in a geographical area onto other regions, in Europe. Good job otherwise."

It leads people to vote right wing and against their own interests. Why? Because left has labeled them racist so why to vote left.   I think the biggest hurdle for left is to understand that there are people with different opinions and sometimes they have a genuine reason behind it.   Now there are similar people on right as well,who are in echo chamber and anything left says is socialist utopia.

Here's a copy-paste from a comment I made earlier regarding demands for Big Ben to be [chimed](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/uk-politics-51107646) in celebration of our departure from the EU.  &gt;I return to my football supporter analogy: for a large majority of the leave camp, the financial and political ramifications are irrelevant. They neither know, nor care what the real world consequences of their vote will be. It was a purely emotional vote and that was their only investment in their ""team"" ""winning"". The only pay off from their win is 'bragging rights"". A ""win"" is meaningless to them unless they get to make it clear to the other side that ""they lost"".  This is the fundamental difference between leave and remain. Had we remained in the EU by the same vote margin, I would have hoped that the narrow result would have lit a fire under our government *and* the EU, to investigate the causes of so many of our electorate being *so* pissed off with the status quo.

Every time I have asked people about these points and more, I have been given a condescending answer (you will understand when you are older) or just dismissed as needing to get behind brexit and have faith.   I don’t have faith. I have fear. I fear that in a months time I will be struggling to provide for my family.

Historically FPTP has been perfectly fine in the U.K. with both the conservatives and labour fully supporting it. Or do you wish for more UKIP and Brexit MPs in Westminster via PR? Which would have happened over the past few elections.   Wishing for another voting system to manipulate the result into another answer when that system doesn’t exist isn’t a valid answer.   The same argument would be argued by leavers IF proportion representation was the legal system the U.K. used and FPTP wasn’t used.   Blaming the voting system on what if’s is poor.  And suggesting the U.K. should just change its voting system on one vote because you didn’t like the answer is embarrassing.   A bad workman always blames his tools.

Let's look at this with a parallel. Gay marriage, abortion and such are deeply divisive issues in some countries. You can figure out an issue better suiting for you, but for the sake of argument, these work fine. Let's also think about a country where these issues are deeply divisive, with a lot of public discussion for and against them and fairly equal support for both sides. These exist in real life.  Now, think how people would take it if the government of this kind of country held a publicly funded festival and took a side for the issue. It's one thing to have a government decide something against what you think is correct, but it's entirely another to also spend public money to celebrate this decision you feel stupid. Now, of course for every issue there is someone who disagrees, but when it is about half the population, this feels even more divisive.  Honestly, I am baffled by the idea that a festival like this would bring national unity rather than feeling like the government rubbing brexit happening on the faces of pro-remain people. That said, I am not an UK citizen or public relations expert, so who knows. While I think it is fine to criticize Brexit for its stupidity, I think that at this point one needs to accept that it is likely happening by an apparently legitimate way, even if UK media and political system are utterly idiotic.

Because that cardigan she's wearing is most definitely a mesh top and the way she has arranged its cleavage blatantly draws you to her ""features"" and the way she is displaying them.  She knows how to dress for an occasion, as the interview of her defending her slavery comments on BBC clearly shows. And looking at her CV, she might have questionable views, but she's neither  stupid nor as ""working class"" as she is trying to style herself at that parliamentary sitting. And it's therefore very clear, that she's ""dressing for the occasion"" in this example as well. She's clearly dressing to insult and provoke.

ecanchoun,2020-01-15 09:59:02,feg8o1l,t3_eovdh7,t1_feg4wn7,"1) &gt; The ECHR only has supremacy in lazy countries that don’t have a codified constitution   What a ridiculous statement. I’d be happy if you’d provide a source at least. [Never mind](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-6265-273-6_3), I have done it for you. The fact that Britain doesn’t have a codified constitution is representative of the fact that Britain hasn’t had the severe problems with citizens rights abuses of the past, that other countries have had. Strangely enough also, Britain’s political institutions have existed, untampered with for longer than any other country. If Britain is lazy for being stable and not being subject to the governance of radicals that jeopardised people’s rights so much, the constitution needed codifying to prevent those incidences, is it lazy or is just stable?   2) There’s absolutely no irony there whatsoever. By the way this country functions, referendums are taken across the U.K. as a whole, not across England, Scotland, Wales and NI independently. I absolutely believe in increased devolved powers for all three of the other nations within the union. Those were not the conditions we existed under at the time and changing the prospects of the referendum around is as bad as the leave campaign over-spending.    3) That’s not exactly correct though. The U.K. negotiated an opt-out for the monetary union and later didn’t sign on to join the Schengen area regulation, thus it gained an opt-out, but since every other country in Europe is voting for draft legislation slowly putting into place, federal mechanisms, of which the U.K. has managed to receive an opt-out the previous mentioned ones, how can British voters be assured that the U.K. will be able to get opt-outs for future legislation of the federal kind. What I found funny was that though the UK’s opt out of the Single currency union, as permanently stated in the Maastricht treaty in 1992, it somehow had to again defend against its own inclusion in the single currency in the drafting and adoption of the Lisbon treaty. I get that the Euro was suffering irreproachable damage to its stability through the recession, but a permanent opt-out is, exactly that. I will not say that voters across Europe are unanimous in their support for the EU,  but they are a dammed sight more supportive of it than British voters...oh...wait...British voters didn’t get a referendum on the ratification of the Maastricht treaty. Maybe that quantifies the need for a codified constitution, however I find it peculiar that Europe essentially tried a second attempt to get the U.K. into the single currency and  the coalition of 2010-2012 had to use the UK’s veto to stop it. You frame it as if the EU is protecting British people from their own government, which may be true in the case of the uncodified constitution and the way rights held within that could be subject to misrepresentation, but if the rest of the European member states are on an alternative path to the U.K. - towards a Federation, then not only is there any way to prove that the British government could stop legislation, even when it objects to it in the EP and EC (that is all provided the U.K. has veto powers, of which it does on only a few laws), but if the U.K. and the rest of Europe are inextricably drifting from their respective courses, the U.K. cannot carry on a future in a Union with completely different goals in mind.   I respect some of the arguments you have made but I really cannot see how you think the British government will be able to keep on preventing  legislation passing that seeks to further increase the legitimacy and builds a foundation of a Federation, that includes a European constitution, which was luckily rejected. I wonder which other unions have a constitution that requires ratification by each individual state to then making them a part of the “project”. Say... the United States of America."

Just one example would by the Lydia Foy case. All EU countries that did not have a codified constitution with at least implicit protections of Human rights adopted the European convention on human rights which in turn made the ECHR effectively a court of final appeal. The UK adopted the European convention on human rights into law in 1998. As for example Ireland has not the ECHR judgements are seen as advisory and have been ignored in the past on gender v passport issues and abortion. TLDR if the UK had a codified constitution which at least implicitly protected human rights the wouldnt have had to adopt the European convention on human rights and the ECHR would be toothless in the UK.  2) Agree to disagree I think there is great Irony in one Union pulling out of another and pulling its members out with it. NI and Scottish voters agree given the gains Nationalist parties had in both areas at the last ge.   3) Regardless of what you think or feel the EU could not evolve into a fully federal body without the members politicians having an opt out and in some cases such as Ireland a referendum being held.

They would likely scrap directives if they planned to move in that direction and stick solely to regulations. The ECJ is the real take away point, the EU essentially exists in it's current format because of the ecj and the van gend en loos judgement which removed dualism from the treaties. The ECJ has and does rule against the EU it is extremely unlikely that a move to a federal government would survive a challenge in the ECJ. But even if it did there would be absolutely nothing stopping a country from triggering Article 50 there and then..... unless winding all the way back you dont trust your own politicians to do so in which case why would you choose to give them even more power."

AngSt3r11,2020-01-15 11:40:02,fegd570,t3_eozf6i,t1_fegb1zx,"The European electoral system is better however, in terms of actual representation in the European Parliament (EP) European voter turnout is extremely low. Only in 2019 did it start to rise again as, since the first elections in 1979, voter turnout has steadily decreased. Therefore, I would argue that the European Parliament isn’t as representative as you’d think since there is an overwhelming majority of European Citizens who simply don’t vote.   https://europarl.europa.eu/election-results-2019/en/turnout/    As well as this, the ordinary legislative procedure is the dominant legislative procedure and EP’s powers under this are weak. They rely on the Commission to propose legislation as they cannot propose it themselves thereby, European citizens have little say in terms what legislation is proposed. However, it is arguable that the Member States have increased the participation of citizens in the legislative procedure in other ways by introducing the European Citizens Initiative. This allows for citizens to propose legislation to the Commission so long as they satisfy the requirements. Since it’s introduction user the Treaty if Lisbon, the ECI has a fairly low success rate and is underused meaning citizen participation is still weak.  https://europa.eu/citizens-initiative/home_en   Another factor contributing to the unrepresentative nature of EP is the use of trilogues. These are often used in the ordinary legislative procedure and result in most of the EP being almost completely sidelined from the legislative process: only 30 of the 750 MEPS are present during these. This results in very skewed representation and a tunnelling of the debate as, most of the time, the final legislative text is far removed from what was read in the first reading to EP. Therefore, many MEPs, and thereby European citizens, are not represented in the legislative process.   EP’s powers in the legislative process comes from negotiation; they rarely use their veto and instead the threat of its use provides them with power. They use this threat to get amendments in other legislative procedures where they have even less power. Ultimately, this weakens EP, and as a result European citizens, as the Commission and European Council dominate the legislative procedure leading to the domination of executive politics.     In summary, I would argue that the EP is not as representative as Westminster as they have considerably poorer voter turnout and because the EP is a weak/ negotiating parliament whilst Westminster is a strong parliament able to properly challenge their government. Westminster’s legislative process is also considerably more open and transparent. All this adds up to a Parliament (EP) that is weak in terms of representation and citizen participation.     Feel free to disagree and provide counter-points, I’m sorry this turned into an essay but I study EU law and like to use these subs to get other people’s opinions on these topics so that my university doesn’t just force feed me their opinions and so I gain a greater understanding of the EU.

Especially if you take into account the fact that awareness for these elections is up to it's member states.   In Belgium, we have an obligation to vote.  Because everyone's voice must be heard.  Even if you're disintrested, you can vote blank or invalid.   If you have a right to vote, then you leave that decision up to the public.  People not bothering to vote, is equal to them saying ""I don't care who's in power"".  That's your choice, and that's you simply agreeing to the representation that's chosen.  So choosing not to turn out to vote, is casting a vote.   The amount of seats remains the same - it's not dependant on the amount of people voting.   I would agree that representation wasn't present if it meant that the seats were distributed in terms of votes cast.  This isn't the case.    &gt; Another factor contributing to the unrepresentative nature of EP is the use of trilogues.    Not an expert, but the people in those trilogues are elected officials as well?   And parliament can still discard these changes according to the wiki?    On the flipside you have the UK where MP's sometimes have to vote according to party lines, completely ignoring the wishes of the MP, and his representation.  How is better to have an elected representative who holds an opinion, and then gets whipped into following party lines?    &gt; Ultimately, this weakens EP, and as a result European citizens  Proof?   Ultimately it makes sure that nothing can get passed unless all member states agree.  I fail to see how it weakens the EP.  It's a coin with 2 sides.   Even if it were the case, MEP's playing political games is their choice?  And by exentension also the choice of the European citizens.    &gt; whilst Westminster is a strong parliament able to properly challenge their government.    A government that tries to suspend it's power.  Needs to be unlocked via judicial powers, and even then has problems accepting it?   Or with Boris' current government holding such a majority that oppossition has little or no influence, completely incapable of challenging Government.    &gt; Westminster’s legislative process is also considerably more open and transparent.    Citation needed.    &gt; All this adds up to a Parliament (EP) that is weak in terms of representation    Let's not forget that First past the post system completely whipes out votes of a large percentage of the population.   In a FPTP system my vote for the oppossition is completely ignored and irrelevant.  It doesn't count for anything.   At least in the European system it'll still count and result in more representation of your voice.  Even with a lower turnout it's more democractic.   I'd argue that casting a vote, and being irrelevant in the eventual representation, is way worse that simply not bothering to vote and having a representative with a little less power (assuming that is the case even)."

Christ John Major did it for far more dodgy purposes. Cash for questions.   Like much of the time before the election where the government was in a minus majority the running of the house was being controlled by the speaker and the law courts dictating new laws which never existed at the behest of remainer judges. Tony Blair has a lot to answer for with the creation of the supreme UK courts that have done nothing of note.  So you saying forcing is incorrect. The government pulled it because what they submitted would have been changed due to the negative majority. E.g. having a none functioning parliament.   And your referring to the same thing I said above. The general election was ultimately the only solution to get parliament working again. Or do you think the government should be in power with no power with the order of discussion being controlled by the speaker and the opposition backbenchers. Let alone they had run out of things to discuss due to having a lack of queens speech.   Your parliamentary knowledge is poor dude as with your interpretation of what actually happened.  edit: forgot to say PR has already been decided in recent times. 2011 to be precise.

My only issue is with you saying she is displaying her breasts, when she is only wearing a cardigan. Her chest looks like any other older woman's chest. As you age, your breasts sag. She wears normal clothes; there's no reason to think she would pick these clothes to show off her chest (I mean, why she would even do that?)   And sometimes your chest is observable through clothes, not because you want to flaunt it, but because your chest exists and you can't hide it out of existence. If a woman wears a normal blouse, and you can see the shape of her breats, it's not because she wants to show off her chest, but because all clothes fit her like that (unless she wears extremely oversized clothes like Billie Eilish does)"

Now this isn't like the red lines that were drawn up by the Tories such as ""no checks between the UK and Northern Ireland"" These are red lines that they know won't change.

It leads people to vote right wing and against their own interests. Why? Because left has labeled them racist so why to vote left.  That isn't what we do though. This is always the same complaint, but if you actually read what we write on here you won't find us saying ""leavers are bigots and racists"". From my perspective it looks like leavers **want** it to be so - i.e. leavers want remainers to just be calling leavers racists/bigots, as that way you can ignore our *actual* arguments and claim we're not arguing in good faith.   I engage in debates with leavers constantly, and I don't think I've ever called a single leaver a racist or bigot in my replies or comments. I ask for reasons, and thoughts, and then often get no reply, or when I get a reply I get a lot of odd attacks on me rather than arguments. The arguments I do get are rarely objectivley good ones, and I usually can easily reply and link to fact checking sites, and then... they tend to argue the fact checking sites are biased...   p.s.

Also, the TV was filled with vox Pop from these people declaring with tears in their eyes that they had ""tuk ower cuntree bac"".  The Germans bombed their nan. The French needed rescuing by us in the war. The Spanish should know their place after we sank their armada........  Salt of the earth, but wouldn't know the difference between a realistic trade deal and a kick in the balls. It's not even that they don't understand the ramifications. They just don't care. For them, it's all about ""us bein' better than any forriner"".  Harsh, but true.  &gt;Based on observations over the last say 5 years, do you believe this is likely?  Absolutely. It would have frightened good ol' Dave to death. He *never* thought for a moment that he would lose.  We went from Dave going and having a half hearted whine to Brussels that barely made the news to ""that's it we're leaving!"". The shock from the EU was palpable. They have done all they can to avoid us having to leave since that announcement.  Imagine if we'd had the *ADVISORY* referendum *before* Dave went to speak to the European parliament. I think the results would have been very different if the British pm had stood up in front of them and said ""You've seen the result of the referendum. Things need to change or we will be forced to leave."""

ADRzs,2020-01-15 18:31:55,fehbger,t3_eopl6u,t1_fegr1tw,"No, everything referred to WWI.  It was the US entry in WWI and the progressive build up of American Troops in the western front that changed the equation.  It is unlikely that Britain and France would have prevailed on their own, considering that the Germans had put Russia out of the equation.  Without the US entry,  the most likely outcome of WWI would have been a negotiated peace treaty which, most likely, would have allowed Germany to retain its captured areas in the East. The US entry and the millions of US troops dramatically changed the equilibrium.  In WWI, as far as the outcome of the war goes, both Britain and the US were inconsequential.  The war was won by the Russians.  At the time of the Normady landings, the Red Army was already in Warsaw.  They occupied Berlin 9 months later. If the allies had not landed, it may have taken the Russians probably a few more months, but the Wehrmach was done anyway.  In WWII, the British contribution was more than anemic.  They struggled mightly in North Africa against a tiny German force in battles that could only be described as simple reconnaisances in force in the Eastern Front.  They allowed the Germans to really bloody them in Italy.  The Germans were actually still holding Northern Italy by the time Germany surrendered.  It is difficult to really account for the fact that the British Army performed so poorly in WWII.  They suffered so many key defeats against numerically inferior opponents such as in Crete, in Tobruk and in Singapore.  It is just possible that the British Army had not recovered from WWI."

He might have said the EU *control* £350m a week of our money, which is basically incorrect, but from a specific and narrow POV could be said to be correct.   If he had said they *cost* us £350m then that would be incorrect - the rebate ensures that the most you could argue EU membership costs us is approx £200m a week (and that's very much the gross cost, ignoring all the benefits we receive from EU membership)"
ADRzs,2020-01-15 18:46:51,fehczjr,t3_eouv0o,t1_feg4h35,"Well,  I disagree with you.  You would need to explain to me why the EU is not legitimate.  Do you even understand what this means?  I am all for the European identity.  We share a lot in history, law, culture, art and social development.  We need to concentrate on what unites us, not what divides us.  Patriotism is great, you should be proud for your country...nobody argues with this.  Nationalism, though, is bad because it sets as apart and accentuates conflicts needlessly.  In virtually all cases, the common narrative is a product of fiction.  We should be aware of this.  As for Macron and Merket dictating to the rest of group, this is partly true as they are the biggest and most powerful members of the union.  However, clevel politics in EU summits have allowed smaller countries to combine and push their ideas forward quite effectively.  Italy and Spain managed to deflect French and German conditions on the rescue of their economies during the financial crisis.  The Union has been extremely helpful to smaller countries directing huge sums of money for the development of certain Eastern European states.  The game has to played cleverly, and it is...by the good players.  You can see for example all the support that Ireland have gotten during the Brexit imbroglio.  Now, I actually think that Macron and Merkel have been too tolerant of some of the small states.  Poland and Hungary should have been expelled from the Union because of their intolerant policies,  Instead, the Union has only partially decreased their grants, irrespective of the fact that these states have really restricted democracy.  Hopefully, after the Brexit issues have been solved, the Union must turned its attention to these rogue Eastern European states.  If they cannot live according to the treaties they have signed on their own free will, well, I would be supportive of their expulsion."

The back stop and how it effects the future relationship. It’s gone.  The U.K. won’t be stuck in any type of backstop bar the transition period this year that was going to happen backstop or not.   You may think it’s a small fact but radically changes how the EU treats the future relationship from something that might happen if they NI border is ever resolved to the U.K. actually leaving the EU with a deadline which takes it out of the hands of the EU. Also the U.K. won’t be stuck in a comatose state of having to have regulatory alignment whilst having no way to escape the backstop.   The EU said they wouldn’t reopen the WA but they did. Personally I don’t think until the election that the U.K. was ever going to leave. The penny has now dropped.   Surely you must be aware of this. People have had half a year talking about it.

I wouldn’t exist without immigration! But watching the economy swan dive is such a bad outcome that ironically, I myself have become an economic migrant. Skilled workers like myself leaving doesn’t help the economy or Labour market but it does help net immigration, which is I guess something that might please Brexit voters.

There is a clear division in how Britain wants to go vs the rest of Europe. Perhaps in the case of Britain, the Euroskeptic movement’s partial victory in the U.K’s referendum is only an outlying result. We cannot know that because no other country has had a (recent) referendum on membership of the Eu, however many have had referendums on adopting crucial parts of EU legislation. In this case, perhaps an uncodified constitution not allowing British citizens to have referendums on adopting the many various treaties over the years, has contributed to the U.K. (not unanimously) feeling That the European Union is undemocratic, when the flaws in our own system were paramount. Euroskeptic movements exist all over the EU but because those countries had referendums on adopting pieces of EU legislation, it only makes sense that they feel the EU (along with all of its benefits) are working for them, and surely that easily edges arguments to a pro-EU side."

It is a fallacy that if one ignores bigotry and racism and stay nice, some how, some way, these people may find their way into voting in more thoughtful way.  That would never happen.  This is purely a numbers game.  Only a small part of the electorate is open to persuasion.  Maybe 10 -15%, that is about all.  The bigots would remain bigots whatever insults you throw at them.  These guys are convinced that they have the right answers and anything that I, you, or anybody else would say, would have absolutely no effect.  So, why not call it the way it is?"

I ask for reasons, and thoughts, and then often get no reply, or when I get a reply I get a lot of odd attacks on me rather than arguments. The arguments I do get are rarely objectivley good ones, and I usually can easily reply and link to fact checking sites, and then... they tend to argue the fact checking sites are biased..  It does not matter at all if you call them bigots or not.  You are not going to change their minds.  If they are insistent on their position although they do not have any argument why this is so, anything you would say would make absolutely no impression.   The reason that they do not answer back is because they know that they are bigots and they know that the true answers would not ""play well"".  So, they keep silent"

They were either Remainers or they were OK with a 2nd referendum (and virtually all who supported a 2nd referendum were Remainers).

Yes, Germany was experiencing food shortages, but it had won the war in the East and acquired substantial territories there.  Ludendorff managed to move 40 army divisions to the western front.  Without the Americans (who were either involved in the fighting, or held areas of the front allowing French and English troops to engage), it is quite possible that the Germans may had captured Paris (the got within 40 miles of it).  It was the failure of the German offensive in 1918 that totally destroyed the morale in Germany (and mostly Ludendorff's spirit) .  If they Americans had not entered the war and there was no prospect of millions of troops arriving in the western front, my guess is that by late 1917 the Entente would have entered into negotiations with Germany to end the war by some kind of peace treaty that would have probably restored the status pro ante."

In fact, the British public voted overwhelmingly in 1975 to enter the EC.    The UK was not ""forced to accept immigrants"".  In fact, free movement of EU citizens was enshrined in the Treaty of Rome, one of the treaties that the UK signed on and one that was accepted by the British public in the 1975 referendum.  The UK was not ""shackled"" by any trade deals.  In fact, the UK delegation was a key component in the teams that negotiated all the trade deals.  The UK participated in all the committees, in the Commission, it took part in the summits, it had many MEPs and it actually had thousands of its citizens working in the Brussels bureaucracy.

But, given the current climate of US isolationism and Russian aggression, I think military cooperation across the EU is a perfectly sensible idea. 2. I was aware that the CJEU has the final say on the interpretation of EU laws. Do you think it would be better for each individual state to decide on its own interpretation of EU laws? Would that make any kind of sense? 3. The EU doesn't legislate on ""all matters"", and never has.

That sounds like a really crazy conspiracy theory to me.  What would remain have led to? I don't think people voted to remain because they wanted to go anywhere in particular.

No, people being forced into a single point of view is bad and makes for very unstable societies. You might think this is counter-intuitive because a single point of view gives little scope for disagreement. The problem is, the disagreements simply grow quietly until they explode. In a small way, this is what happened with the referendum vote: name calling and other abusive tactics by remainers (see this forum for a plethora of examples) caused leavers to hold their peace. The vote surprised almost everyone.  &gt; I really have difficulty understanding the Brexiter mind  The key to this, and something you might like to think about, is that the bulk of the Brexiter vote is the older part of the electorate.  These are people who 1. have a considerable amount of experience as to how things tend to pan out and 2. remember how we were taken into the the EEC and the deception involved.  &gt; Is that about right?  No, the British wound up the empire in a very cooperative and voluntary manner moving through stages to complete independence to avoid the instability that tends to occur when nations first become independent. Mostly, it was quite effective. Some of the other colonial nations, however, left on very bad terms with their former colonies. These nations are notably in the Euro zone.

Individual nations have less impact on it's value. This can of course be positive and negative. As you will to some degree be reliant on others.  2. Through international cooperation you can keep the value of the currency even if 1-2 countries do something wrong. Don't get me wrong it will lose some value. But it's much more resistant to hyperinflation. Having the entire area drop it's currencies value is better than having 1 country having essentially no more international economy due to hyperinflation.  3. For travel I love the euro. The fact you don't need to exchange your money, pay fees to do so etc. Is a major advantage for anyone regularly going over to a neighboring country.  4. International trade is much easier due to everyone knowing the respective value of the currency right away. In a trade between 2 companies using the same currency the actions of your government won't simply change the deal  on a short scale. 1 euro is 1 euro at all times. Meanwhile 1 GBP can be worth 1.20 Euro one day and 0.80 euro the next. Again this can both be positive and negative. But for long negotiations between companies within the Eurozone the constant value of the euro is an advantage.  Example: we've been working on a sale of equity from the UK to the EU in 2015. You are trying to sell something to me for 1 million pounds  (1.2m euro)  then as we are about to sign the Brexit referendum happens and the value of the pound suddenly drops by 10%. So now we either renegotiate or you take an effective 10% loss.  Between 2 countries in the Eurozone the value is constant and thus this cannot happen. Making these kind of international transactions easier.  Yes having your own currency allows you to influence the value more, which in some situations is good and in other situations is terrible. Tactical devaluation though is a tool that some others mentioned in other threads, but when that's necessary its generally because you screwed up and are trying to limit damage. So it's generally a last ditch effort.  In the end it's either a choice: have a more stable currency that makes trading more consistent with other countries using the same currency. Or having a currency your nation can influence more, this however can be both more beneficial and more devastating depending on the situation you put yourself in."

The fact you don't need to exchange your money, pay fees to do so etc. Is a major advantage for anyone regularly going over to a neighboring country.  At best it is a very minor advantage.

Did British voters not vote for Heath? Did they not elect parliamentarians who later approved successive european treaties?  Oh wait, we are talking UK here, so I guess thats not entirely correct. Non representative elections, an unelected house of lords and all. I'll grant you that, just dont blame the EU for that.  Whatever Heath or Monnet wanted is so moot. They are dead. They had their ideas. One some will find idiotic, others may find visionary.  But their idea's do not rule. People you elect do.  &gt;The latter was revealed to have lied through his teeth  That doesnt sound familiar at all. Did they also use a red bus?  &gt;The League of Nations and the Coal and Steel Board were definitely NOT elected.  I dont know what the league of nations has to do with any of this, but at least democratic member states did elect their representation. Coal and steel board was comprised of democratic nations and its institutions where all indirectly elected. You know, just like your own prime minister. In europe we have made considerable progress since with far more directly elected representation. And you want to go back to totally unelected lobbyists creating legislation in secret back room deals.  &gt;They will be trade talks, not a route to a federal state.  What do you think the single market is? What do you think trade talks are about?  The concept is identical,  states in question have to agree on common rules to be able to reduce trade barriers and ensure fair competition. Rules aka laws. Someone has to make them aka legislation. Someone needs to oversee implementation aka as the executive. There needs to be arbitration when there are disputes, aka as a court system.  This is as true for any trade deal as it is for the EU. Its the same thing, its just that the EU takes free trade  further than any other group of nations by completely removing all trade barriers between members,  including all non tariff barriers and all restrictions on flows of capital and human capital. Of course that requires a higher level of harmonization which is why we built all those institutions that ensure democratic representation in them, rather than having to rely on secret negotiations between unelected lobbyists resulting in omnibus legislation.  If you dont like that, is that because you prefer trade barriers and less freedom, or because you prefer less democracy?  &gt;Since you mention it, the Labour prime minister Harold Wilson refused to kowtow to the US on the subject of Vietnam at a time when Britain, thanks to our EU neighbours who invaded Poland, was enormously in debt to the other nation. It did not stop trade.  Whats that got to do with anything?  Besides, trade in 60s has almost nothing in common with today. Back then virtually all we did was ship  raw materials or finished goods, and production was overwhelmingly local. Every country built their own cars, made their own steel, had their own textile industry, their own fishing, they built their own planes.  Supply chains where overwhelmingly national. We traded coal for grain. Oil for steel.  That has nothing to do with trade in the 21st century, which is based on far longer and far more complex supply chains. The only way to build a plane or a car today is by sourcing components from dozens of nations, and each component also has supply chains that are just as long and complex.  And more importantly, trade today, at least for us,  is overwhelmingly **services**.  That makes it a completely different animal, because almost all our legislation covers services rather than goods.  Healthcare, education, banking, all employement regulations, social welfare,.. . Thats quite a bit more complex than specifying grain sizes or classifying crude oil. Trading goods is easy. Free trade in services, thats a different story."

But that's why there are regulations and consequences for not following the rules set. That's why not everyone is free to join the Euro. Have some nations taken too much liberty with the Euro? Maybe, was it ultimately a disaster. No, a set back for sure. But it's been solved. In the end it's a risk-reward setup. Your own currency carries its own risks and potential rewards. Having a shared currency allows for lower risks when trading with other nations within this currency with a lower potential reward. Randomly allowing anyone in is a risk as well. But with proper arrangements it's not that big of a deal.   The travel example was not of great importance. Maybe. But it's what most people will notice when going on holidays etc. Most normal consumers don't have anything to do with every currency exchange and aren't too reliant on it. But when they visit another country it is a benefit to mention nonetheless.  It didn't happen (yet? But it could). But the GBP has seen some major drops from 1 day to the next compared to the Euro. It has also seen some rises.  As i said it can be worth 1.20 one day and could be worth half next day. In reality the changes usually aren't that drastic.

This decision took markets by surprise. Due to last-minute polling which suggested that ‘remain’ had the edge, sterling initially rallied – with the pound to euro rate before Brexit rising to €1.32, while also reaching highs of $1.50 against the US dollar.  But as the Brexit result reverberated around the world, the pound experienced its largest intra-day collapse in 30 years. Sterling fell harder against the dollar than it did against the euro – reaching lows of $1.32 and €1.20 respectively – as the eurozone was already facing internal struggles over an Italian referendum and French elections.  As you can see the Brexit referendum results had a quite drastic impact on the value to the GBP. Now imagine another major change such as no deal. In the article they can show that even the threat of no deal already has an impact on the value of the GBP. While most changes aren't huge, in multi million pound/dollar/euro deals every increase of decrease can make a massive change."

This drop was way larger as normal fluctuation of a currency. If you can think of a better reason i'd love to hear it. But the referendum fits the drop most. A massive impending change that wasn't expected and is going to impact the economy in unknown ways. creates a lot of uncertainty. Uncertainty is bad for the value of a currency.  https://www.exchangerates.org.uk/brexit-pound-exchange-rate-tracker Shows some correlations of certain events and what happened to the pound.  The reason brexit has some significant impact on the GBP is because no-one knows exactly what will happen afterwards, the uncertainty this causes leads to a decline in investments, companies will be more careful etc. Others have moved their HQ to other countries in the EU. This is all bad for the economy. There are some clear indications that everytime a large announcement is made with regards to brexit the pound spikes (up or down depending on what happened).  As for the EU being more stable, if 1 member state does the same things the Euro as a whole is less afffected. The UK is leaving, yet this doesn't reflect in the same way on the Euro, mostly because the UK is only part of the EU and not all of it. EU wide implementations affect the euro more as nation wide changes. Hence it is more stable. That being said there are still spikes in the Euro when something does happen. Major changes such as the crisis with Greece can still affect the Euro in a major way. After this crisis the member states have sharpened their rules to avoid another catastrophe like it."

Both Canada and Australia lost more people.  What would have happend if the US didn't agree to go in in force is speculative. The facts are that the blockade and war destroyed the German economy at home and that mainly the French and British destroyed the German army on the western front in late 2018 with support from the Americans.

In any case, even if the US troops were not involved directly in the fighting, they replaced French and British troops in quite sectors so that the Allies could use experienced troops to stop the German offensive.      The American involvement in WWI was key in the Allied victory.  It is not just my position, this is also the position of various historians of the period, including J. Fuller.  The US contribution was massive, I believe that there were about 1.5 million US troops in France in 1918.    If the Allies had not turned the tide in the Fall of 1918, it is doubtful that the tight food situation in Germany would have terminated German involvement.  Considering the vast areas to the East which came under German control, given time, the Germans may have found a way of relieving the shortages.  However, with the battle of Amiens and the clear loss of any hope in winning this war, German morale collapsed.  Again, I understand that both arguments deal with hypotheticals and are speculative.  We cannot go back to the past and validate any assumption (unfortunately)."

On Reddit, I can rage against the machine and scream into the void. The way we've ended up in the position we are in is just incredible to me. I wouldn't have believed the farce of the last few years could be acted out in my country.   I was accused earlier, (possibly by you? I lose track.) of ""sulking"". I prefer ""impotent rage"".   You accuse me of being foolish for worrying because I have no way of knowing that my fears will come to fruition. I would retort: that didn't stop people from taking a massive gamble with my future based on that same flawed method. The only difference between us is I was voting for a known quantity. They were not.  The *real* point is, as you say, the issue and all it's ramifications are *way* beyond the ability of the average punter to predict. That is why we appoint people to make these decisions for us. That's how a representative democracy is supposed to work.  If a Eurosceptic government had been elected to power on the back of a ""leave"" manifesto, I believe the anguished howls from Remainers would have been greatly subdued. A childishly simple ""yes/no"" popularity contest was a crazy idea considering the consequences. After all. Our latest scientific research vessel isn't called ""Boaty McBoatface"" for *exactly* that reason.  So, to wrap up. Thank you for the conversation. I'm sorry I disappoint you, but I'm just adapting to swim in the swamp our current politics have become."

They had to be recalled because Johnson claimed he could take us out of the EU without a deal to meet his October deadline.

What's wrong with Parliament having time to read a law before voting on it?  &gt;You are having a laugh dude. Dictatorship. Please.  Democracy is more than just voting every five years.

Sjwsjwsjw2,2020-01-18 03:43:30,fepf81i,t3_eouv0o,t1_feg7730,"Why do you think FPTP is idiotic? I've been sitting at home in London with a German friend who has come for the weekend and chatted about this. I've always been curious as to why other countries in Europe seem to have a much bigger issue with extremist politics, mostly right wing because thats what gets reported but I'm sure on the left too. I'd always assumed that our colonialist past had led to greater tolerance and truly believe that despite remainers wanting to slur us as racists and fascists we're actually a relatively welcoming and tollerant society. So, getting back to the point, my friend Heinrich tells me that the issue with PR is that governments struggle to make decisions and nothing gets done, hence the extremes become more popular.   You say that more people in other European countries and in the EU parliament have a say but in reality it amounts to very little and marginalises at least as many people as FPTP does in the UK alongside fuelling extremism which to a large extent we've avoided. Please think about this and be careful what you wish for."
elmokki,2020-01-18 10:57:10,feqqxbm,t3_eouv0o,t1_fepf81i,"FPTP takes out many people's ability to have a say. If you didn't vote for the majority party in your constituency, your vote was wasted. If one talks about democracy, I think it's a really, really big thing to have a representative democracy be actually representative. When I put it like this, maybe it doesn't sound so serious, but UK has literally had constituencies where the winning candidate got less than a third of the vote, making over two thirds of the votes cast meaningless. That's just insane.  Now, what you say about extremism makes some sense. The fact that FPTP cements a two party system fairly strongly does limit parties like the Brexit party rising. However, not only is this sort of censorship a bit arbitrarily antidemocratic, it also censors parties that one could feel are a good change. Which, of course, Brexit party is from some peoples' view. Also, Brexit party got 2% of the vote in last elections. That's hardly a large share of the seats even with perfect representation.  I would also argue that FPTP drives the two major parties more towards extremism. They'll never become true extremists, but they will become more and more contrasting from each other. This leads to extremely weird politics.   Now, one true thing about proportional representation is that since it doesn't let two parties become the biggest, getting a majority government is nearly impossible in most countries. Whether this is an issue truly boils down to the political culture. Countries with a long tradition of proportional representation don't get completely paralyzed, although of course having to negotiate does slow things down. That said, not giving a single party all the power also makes a lot of sense: Often there are things that even a majority of a country doesn't want, but that a single party would gladly push through if they had the majority. But, yes, if UK or US moved to proportional representation overnight, it would be a very rough transition since FPTP makes most minor parties one needs to co-operate fiercely regional ones.  The thing is, had I been an UK voter in the last general elections, I would've been very frustrated. I would not wanted to vote either Labour or Conservatives, but chances are that my vote would've been meaningless if I voted for someone else. Unless, of course, I happened to live in the few constituencies where neither was dominant. That said, any Scot who hates SNP was probably equally frustrated.  In case you haven't seen [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9rGX91rq5I), I recommend it. There are caveats for moving to proportional representation for sure, but FPTP definitely has huge issues for representation in a representative democracy. You'd think representation is important for a thing that has representative in its name."

If your a life long green supporter and then have your MP removed for tactical voting how is that fair to the electorate. Classic example with the by election of last year. Where all the parties stood down their MPs to win it, how is that fair to the person voting if only have the option to abstain from voting under duress or vote for a party you don’t want to vote for. Much to the disgust of the MPs that were standing.  I also drag the Brexit party into this with them standing down MPs. So it’s not clever on both sides.

Sjwsjwsjw2,2020-01-19 11:03:53,fexj4r7,t3_eouv0o,t1_feqqxbm,"There are some interesting points,but to me it's a choice between a powerful government that can act quicker and more decisively and make policy that 40+% have voted for or a weaker government which may end up with a compromise which doesn't truly please as many people and may not be agile enough to act in the best interest of the country.  It is always important to vote regardless of whether your party has a chance in your constituency as that informs the main parties what is important to people and how they need to evolve their policies to keep or gain power. As you can see from the last election, Labours refusal to move away from their more left wing policies cost them badly whereas the Conservative party realised that not putting more focus on funding the NHS would have cost them a significant enough amount of votes to not win a majority. It could indeed be argued that the way the Labour Party membership works is more of a problem for democracy than the FPTP system.  As I said, my German friend was explaining the pains of PR government to me and they have been using  PR since WWII so it couldn't be argued that the German system is not mature but he still sees issues with it and he is a centerist so not feeling let down by being on either of the extremes."

However, FPTP is the villain, as it biases a two-party anti-choice duopoly.  &gt;If your a life long green supporter and then have your MP removed for tactical voting how is that fair to the electorate.  FPTP is awful for Greens. They know that if they vote Green in a tight election, they are splitting the pro-environment vote and handing the election to a party that didn't even turn up to the environment debate.  It takes 22 times more votes to elect a Green MP than it does a Tory, which is nuts.  &gt;I also drag the Brexit party into this with them standing down MPs. So it's not clever on both sides.  I have to agree with Farage that standing down MPs is a natural reaction to a crazy voting system. He got 30% in the Euros (a fair election nobody cared about). If you're anti-immigration, then Farage is the only game in town as Tories have been lying about introducing immigration controls for a decade.

I'm talking about the MP standing and more importantly the general public that has it's opinions diminished via tactical voting. Thats completely different than it's a bit bad for the greens.

You can't blame someone for making tactical choices in the face of an unfair voting system.

The hung Parliament we had government which ended up with a zero majority in the end is the closest we have had to a PR government  This was all under FPTP, which rewards divisive politics. We just wasted three years of two main parties unable to work together because the system strongly discourages them from doing so.  PR rewards compromise.

The Italian government has real difficulty in doing anything. With an ever spinning wheel of PMs. Hardly a good advert for PR. Even Germany is struggling currently. It's not a magic solution by any means of running a government.   The main positive of FPTP is if you get a workable majority which had been the case historically in the UK it gives a party a clear path to its manifesto and full filling it. If you agree with it is down to your political beliefs of the manifesto. Johnson currently has this. Blair had a whacking majority for his terms. Maggie had them.     Obviously, the main negative is you have to lump it for a term if you hate the party in power. Sorry, have no sympathy. Conservatives had to endure the Blair and Brown years as much as labour voters had to endure the Thatcher years.   Enough with pinning blame on FPTP. Are you a lib dem? As they constantly complain about it as they have F all chance at doing anything else. I get tired of hearing inclusionism.

Dutchlawyer,2020-06-13 19:35:35,fuqbbkb,t3_h85d86,t1_fuq9584,"Posters really should supply paywalled text themselves, I believe, but here you go:  &gt;  &gt; Winesellers accuse government of misleading over Brexit costs &gt;  &gt; Prices will rise and choice fall given ‘catastrophic’ impact from red tape &gt;  &gt; Daniel Thomas and Laura Hughes in London  &gt;  &gt; The UK wine industry has accused the government of misleading the public over the cost of not securing a trade deal with the EU, warning that prices would rise and choice fall given the “catastrophic” impact from border red tape. &gt;  &gt; Victoria Prentis, a minister in Defra, the department that covers food and drink, told Parliament this week that costs for importing wine after Brexit were expected to be “nil or negligible”. This caused outrage across an industry that has spent months lobbying the government to relax trading rules set to be imposed on European wines after the Brexit transition period — which runs out at the end of 2020, if no deal is secured with Brussels. &gt;  &gt; More than half of the wine drunk in the UK comes from the EU, and this can enter at the moment without checks. If Britain fails to agree a trade deal with the EU, import certificates — known as VI-1 forms — will be needed for every consignment of wine from the bloc, requiring costly lab analysis to keep wine flowing.  &gt;  &gt; This could cost up to £70m a year for the estimated 600,000 consignments, with each form likely to cost around £20 and laboratory tests needed for many shipments at £300-£400. Industry executives estimated these would add about 10p to the price of a bottle of wine. &gt;  &gt; Exporters of the estimated 150,000 consignments of wine leaving the UK for the EU each year will also have to complete a VI-1 form. &gt;  &gt; Executives said they wanted the government to scrap the system after the transition period. &gt;  &gt; Supplies to the UK from some smaller vineyards are expected to dry up as a result. &gt;  &gt; Replying to a question in the House of Commons, Ms Prentis said: “As inspections for imported wine are undertaken on a risk-based percentage, regardless of origin or import certification, no specific assessment has been made regarding additional costs of controls, although it is expected to be nil or negligible.” &gt;  &gt; Miles Beale, chief executive of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, said that it was “extremely disappointing that despite four years of discussing this issue with Defra the facts have fallen on deaf ears and the minister has confirmed that the government has not even bothered to make any assessment”. &gt;  &gt; He added: “The minister has been highly selective in focusing on the costs falling on UK enforcement bodies of requiring import certificates for EU wine and has chosen to completely overlook the significant costs falling to exporters, importers and ultimately UK consumers if we leave without a deal.” &gt;  &gt; The costs of additional VI-1 forms for EU wines will not be “nil or negligible”, he said. “The truth is that for UK wine SME businesses, they will be catastrophic and are likely to put people out of business.”  &gt;  &gt; The industry said the government had not responded to its calls to waive the need for additional documentation and tariffs on wine if there was no trade deal by the end of the year. &gt;  &gt; Defra officials insisted Ms Prentis had not been misleading, as the question posed related to the cost of inspections for imports rather than any cost to industry.  &gt;  &gt; They added that ministers were confident the British public would continue to have a wide range of good-value, quality wines to choose from after Brexit.  &gt;  &gt; A Defra spokesperson said: “We know how important our wine industry is for the nation and the economy, which is why we have removed the requirement for import certificates on wines from the EU during the transition period. &gt;  &gt; “With negotiations under way, we are continuing to work closely with the wine sector to minimise any disruption to the flow of wine in and out of the UK after the transition period.”  &gt;  &gt; John Charnock, managing partner at Jascots Wine Merchants said: “This avoidable additional cost must be recognised and taken seriously — we cannot afford additional burdens on our business at this most trying time.” &gt;  &gt; John Colley, chief executive of Majestic, a wine retailer, added: “Over 60 per cent of the bottles we sell come from the EU, and a requirement to introduce new, costly and burdensome VI-1 forms to keep wine flowing at the end of the transition period would, both inevitably and unfortunately, lead to price increases for our customers.” &gt;"

The £9 billion figure is about right, though it does vary.  However, you seem to be ignoring that this payment was to get various direct and indirect benefits that leaves the UK better off to the tune of about £135 billion a year.  It's unclear which of these benefits the UK will keep, if any, because that is something still to be worked out, but, unless it's pretty much all of them whilst not having to continue to pay anything, which is incredibly unlikely, Brexit will cost more than it saves.  Even before this has been decided, and Brexit has completed, the UK is about £200 billion worse off than it would have been without Brexit happening.  The total net contribution of the UK to the EU between 1973 and 2018 was £216 billion.  &gt;All immigrants speak English and have a non-poverty-level job   Well, firstly, leaving aside why immigrants speaking English appears to be something you're saying will be a positive impact on your life, you seem to think the government's new immigration scheme guarantees all immigrants will speak English.  It doesn't.  Secondly, if the problem you have with immigrants is that they are paid too little, that suggests the problem is really that the minimum wage is too low, or the minimum wage is not being properly enforced, so this is a problem that is not really solved by Brexit at all.  &gt;Escaping the European Court of Human Rights, which sounds good (it literally said ""human rights"") but is actually *opposes* certain human rights like free speech   Leaving aside the statements about it that are rather debatable, at best, you seem think that the ECHR is part of the EU.  It isn't.  &gt;Trade with large currently mostly inaccessible markets like China (yes  this is as yet theoretical, but certainly far easier than trying to get  something through veto-prone EU)   You've finally found something that might be a positive - if you quietly ignore that, due to the substantial size disparity between China and the UK, in order to secure such trade, the UK will basically have to be China's bitch.  &gt;Remove enormous EU agricultural subsidies that increase land waste and property disparity   Unless you want the UK's agriculture industry to be demolished, or standards to take a distinct nosedive, those subsidies are necessary, and will have to be replaced with subsidies from the UK government.  If there is a no deal scenario, then food stocks are going to be under some pressure as it is, so this would not exactly be a wise idea."

Which only applies if you, personally, are going to be communicating with each and every immigrant.  &gt;Look at the lack of belonging felt by Scotland, Ireland, Wales... a  large part of the historical friction and distinct national identities  was a distinct language.  So you're basically saying that Scotland, Ireland and Wales not being England was a big source of all the 'historical friction'.  I think the kind of attitude you're displaying here is a much, much bigger one.  &gt;According to euronews that is a requirement. [https://www.euronews.com/2020/02/19/speak-english-in-order-to-work-in-uk-britain-tells-post-brexit-migrants](https://www.euronews.com/2020/02/19/speak-english-in-order-to-work-in-uk-britain-tells-post-brexit-migrants) It's ""non-tradeable"" in the point system.  Read your own link.  That actually says that immigrants need 70 points to be able to apply to come into the UK.  Having good English gives 10 of those points, but there's other ways to make that up.  Of course, another issue is that, after specifically setting out to create a scheme that blocks low-skilled immigrant workers in favour of high-skilled ones, as they're supposedly unneeded, the government were having to scramble around to make loopholes and exemptions for the likes of the agriculture industry and NHS workers, as it seems those 'unneeded' workers are actually kinda...you know...needed.  This was rather pointedly underlined during the coronavirus pandemic when companies were forced to charter flights to fly in workers from the EU to try to avoid things like fruit simply being left to rot in fields.  So it seems that, even if the government's scheme blocked all non-English speakers (which it doesn't), the government are having to let some folk bypass this scheme, and come in anyway.  &gt;Nothing to do with minimum wage.  ...I'm sorry, I'm sure I can't be reading that right.  I'm reading that as you saying that how much low-paid people are paid is nothing to do with the minimum wage.  I'm sure I can't be reading that right, as that is unbelievably stupid.  &gt;Immigrants should contribute positively to tax-funded social benefits.  They do.

Following the UK's formal announcement on Friday that it would not seek to extend its post-Brexit transition period beyond the end of this year, both sides will stress the urgency of ending the stalemate in the future-relationship negotiations, which have made little headway after four rounds.  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Failure to reach a deal would leave the two sides trading on basic World Trade Organization terms from January 1, with tariffs on goods for the first time in decades.  &gt;  &gt; The EU and UK announced a shift in approach last week, with an intensified schedule of negotiations focused more narrowly on the four main sticking points: the EU's push to retain fishing rights in UK waters; Britain's rejection of EU demands for a regulatory “level playing field”; disagreements over the structure of security co-operation; and a split over the governance arrangements for the future partnership.  &gt;  &gt; UK chancellor Rishi Sunak on Sunday said Britain’s “first preference” was to secure “an ambitious and comprehensive trade arrangement with the European Union”.  &gt;  &gt; But EU chiefs will warn Mr Johnson that the bloc is unified behind the mandate governments have given to chief negotiator Michel Barnier. Mr Barnier has said that, while he is open to exploring compromises, any deal must shield Europe’s companies from unfair competition and prevent the UK “cherry-picking” the benefits of the single market. &gt;  &gt; He accused the UK last week of “looking to maintain the benefits of being a member state” in areas such as freedom of movement for service providers, and mutual recognition of qualifications. “This is simply not in the overall long-term political and economic interest of the European Union,” he said. &gt;  &gt; The EU will also underline that the fate of the trade talks is directly linked to the UK's progress in delivering on commitments made in the UK-EU withdrawal treaty last year to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  &gt;  &gt; EU officials said over the weekend that the mood on this point had been brightened by constructive talks on Friday with a UK team led by Michael Gove. They said the Cabinet Office minister gave assurances that the UK would quickly flesh out proposals it made last month on how to apply customs and regulatory checks in the Irish Sea. &gt;  &gt; Maroš Šefčovič, who led the EU delegation at Friday’s meeting, said he was “very much reassured” by Mr Gove's determination to rapidly turn the new system from “aspirations” to “operational conclusions”. &gt;"

Kango_V,2020-06-15 10:39:31,fuw156f,t3_h9b5dt,t1_fuvw7kb,"The Common Agricultural Policy is a phenomenal EU-Made disaster.  The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is a set of subsidies to European Union (EU) farmers. Giving the lion’s share of the budget to Italy, Germany and France, the average British family loses hundreds of pounds every year in higher food prices.  It not only prevents Britain from fully exploring cheaper options on the world market, but keeps food prices artificially high for British consumers. This is because Britain is prevented from exploring cheaper alternatives elsewhere, while simultaneously giving handouts to inefficient farmers abroad.  Around 40 per cent of the EU budget (£103 billion per annum) is spent on the CAP!  Contrary to false EU-funded reports, all Brexit proposals outline plans to match EU spending for our farmers and fishermen for a minimum of five years at the same level as current “EU subsidies”.  Farmers are paid by the hectare for owning or using land; so the more you have, the more you get. While in the UK benefits for poor people are capped at £20,000 (outside London), these benefits for the rich are uncapped. Some landowners receive £1m or more. You don’t even have to live in the EU to take this money: you just have to own land here. Among the benefit tourists sucking up public funds in the age of austerity are Russian oligarchs, Saudi princes and Texas oil barons.  As a farmer, it's good riddance to the CAP!"

They were well aware of what the rules were. It was just more advantageous to not enforce them to their fullest.   If you were worried about excess EU immigration then requesting the UK government enforce them might have solved the issue. They could set whatever rules they wanted for people coming in outside of the EU.   &amp;#x200B;  Now having more stringent rules might help the UK but pretending that something couldn't have been done from within the EU would be erroneous

So, sorry you cannot be an unimaginative bigot.  FYI, the Qur'an states that 'marriage is void unless entered into by consenting adults'. In 7th Century Arabia, adulthood was defined as the onset of puberty, so it is believed that his wife, Aisha, must have already entered puberty and was therefore an 'adult' when she married Mohammed.  Additionally, Aisha had *previously been married* so probably not the 'little child' being touted by far-right fuckwits.  Something I've just learned is that Aisha was the daughter of one of 55 year-old Mohammed's friends which ages her as significantly older than six, nine, twelve or whatever the aforementioned fuckwits claim.

A lot of countries, including the US, subsidize their domestic agricultural producers. Here in the US, it’s to the tune of about $20 Billion a year when the loan programs, direct payments, and insurance programs are all added up. The interests involved in those programs are too entrenched and too bipartisan for them to be going away any time soon. So it kind of seems that if there’s an FTA between the US and UK (which as an aside, I don’t see happening for a few years), it’s going to involve cheaper American food stuffs entering the British market and competing against British food. Which means your farmers lower their standards to compete or they go out of business.   What it seems you’re ok with, and tell me if I’m wrong, is the destruction of some meaningful percentage of British agriculture in return for the UK leaving the EU. Is that right?"

The implication I was trying to make was that even though Switzerland has four official languages it has, at least in my perception and experience, no problems with forming a strong national identity. Sorry if I was too terse.  You then referenced a Wikipedia article about a regional separation movement where a group within a canton tried to secede from their original canton and form a new one.

Perhaps this URL works for you instead:  [https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1549247](https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1549247)  I'm not sure what ""10 times"" means. When Y is ""ten times"" something, you normally define what that ""something is"". In the above referred paper, I refer you to the data in Tables 5, 6 ,7, 8, 9 (the others are also extremely informative). These indicate the foodborne illness cases (per 100,000) for 5 pathogens across 18 countries (US included). According to your claim, US figures should be elevated by a factor of 10x by ""something"". I will be charitible and in each case identify the number of countries that show 10x cases than the US for each pathogen, as well as the number that are WORSE (or equal) to the US:  Table 5 (Campylobacter spp):   US avg 13.3. 10x fewer cases (1.33):  1/17 (Italy). Number worse than US: 13/17  Table 6 (Salmonella spp):   US avg 15.9. 10x fewer cases (1.59):  0/17. Number worse than US: 12/17  Table 7 (Yersinia spp):   US avg 0.3. 10x fewer cases (0.03):  1/17 (Italy). Number worse than US: 10/14 (3 did not provide data)  Table 8 (verotoxin- and Shiga toxin–producing E. coli):   US avg 1.1. 10x fewer cases (0.11):  1/17 (Italy). Number worse than US: 10/17  Table 9 (L. monocytogenes):   US avg 0.3. 10x fewer cases (0.03):  0/17. Number worse than US: 16/16 (1 did not provide data)  I suppose I could have defined an ""EU average"" incidence of the above rates, but then we'd need to argue of medians vs means etc etc. Not really worth it, given that Denmark, Germany, Sweden and Finland skew the rates to far worse than those in the USA.  I guess we could have just cut to the chase and looked at Table 4, which describes the low incidence rate of each of the above foodborne pathogens as ""Superior"" for the USA, but it was much more fun to assess your claims of ""10 times"" using actual data. If you have contradictory data that controls for factors (no doubt you'll have done some form of regression or principle component analysis, right?), then go ahead and submit it for peer review.

lordfnord23,2020-06-15 22:40:22,fuy9p2d,t3_h9iq8j,t1_fuxloi9,"&gt;Its hardly a major issue in terms of numbers.  Yes. But it is not always about total numbers as it depends on locality. In small fishing towns at the coast,  there is no other business. So this will have influence on the local pub and also on tourism. You can't directly switch to another job there, as there are no other jobs available.  Sure fishing is not really important compared to manufacturing sector or financial services sector if you look at the global numbers. But what could you actually do in a small village on the coast? If you are lucky you can run a surfing lodge (in Cornwall in certain spots with good enough waves for tourist surfers).  You can't expect that these fishermen will move to London and will become employees of Goldman-Sachs and deal with hedge fonds instead.  Having a local run family business that could survive on its own and keeps the village alive, is a real good thing.  It is not always about global numbers.   Quite similar to farming. Sure the EU farming business means a lot of bureaucracy. Depending on EU subsidies can suck, I get why some farmers vote for Leave (and hoped for a better situation, although they actually couldn't compete without subsidies).  Unfortunately, this isn't the reality anymore.   In a WTO/US trade deal scenario, they would compete with Iowa farmers, that have farms as big as some EU countries harvested by automated bots.   Sure the EU farming policy sucks, as it relies heavily on subsidies and there is this overproduce that gets destroyed. ""Communist"" But the US alternative wouldn't be better.   EU farming policy relies on self-sufficiency and the idea that even small family-run farms can work, as farms keep the countryside intact - so even small farms or good.   Anyhoo - back to fishing. Fishing is not important regarding GDP. But this is also true for the EU.  Yet both parties have a big focus on it. And there are some good reasons to prioritize it in the talks."

So the EU would accept a certificate issued by the authorities of those ""poorer countries"" if the necessary treaties ar in effect, making the process at the border a lot faster and friction less. If no such deal exists, the goods need to be decertified in the EU port of entry.  No deal is a head ache not just for exports to the EU. They need to be in place with the minor trading partners outside the EU as well. Unless you're prepared to fine a lot of goods that ar sitting in a harbour some place waiting for the inspector because your own isn't recognised in that country."

The problems with that were equally clear: the ""special relationship"" proved pretty one sided, with the UK being seen as an extension of Washington's foreign policy rather than an equal. The Commonwealth, on the other hand, didn't have much political interests in common with their former colonizers and were much too small and too geographically distant to provide an adequate export market. It all came down on ""Imperial preference"" versus integration with European neighbours."

Also I'm pretty sure there are pro-EU people that bother to check things, as these two are not mutually exclusive and the number of pro-EU people is in the range of millions, so statistically there's an exceedingly low probability that every single one of them wouldn't bother to check things."

The author is saying that the UK political class was somewhat invested in the concept, but didn't like the implementation.  IMHO, even on that point the author is right about one thing: a significant part of the UK political body has never gotten its head around the fact that the UK was now an equal partner, rather than the leader. Maybe Mr. Churchill ""got"" it, but his successors have said and done little to show they do. I do not follow how the author, from this observation, arrives to the conclusion that the UK should have been a key player, as the UK is effectively one of the most isolated countries when it comes to trouble on the continent.  As far as I can see, there was never a time where the UK political establishment was ever really comfortable with being one of the 28 member states. IMHO we should just accept that it would have fallen apart sooner or later and focus on how to get forward. When or if a request for re-accession comes, there should be plenty of time to assess the risk."

And, most definitely never an equal.  &gt;IMHO we should just accept that it would have fallen apart sooner or later and focus on how to get forward.  Fact is, we've had some form of union in Europe, of variable size and membership, for most of the time since the rise of Rome. The one that lasted the longest being the Holy Roman Empire that was, at best a very loose confederation. So, even if the EU should ""fall apart"" it is likely to be replaced by something else. And I suspect any ""falling apart"" is most likely going to ever be a ""crumbling at the edges"" as long as the relationship between Germany and France remains as it is. And that has become an extremely stable relationship with an economy that's interwoven a lot higher than that of the average EU nations. Not to mention the strong historic ties between the two (and sure, animosities as well. But those seem to be fading)."

I would, however, question your claim that the differences are small. The UK is 3.1 per 100,000; Germany is 4.1. That's a difference of about 25%, no?   Belgium is 5.8 compared to Britain's 3.1, which I think is actually quite a huge difference, given that both Belgium and the UK have similar population densities.

And in Germany there is no speed limit on the Autobahn, which probably contributes as well. Plus countless other factors (like tourists travelling through continental Europe by car).   So I think it's difficult to directly compare these numbers and then attribute that to one of the many many differences. Although I do admit that there is likely a small improvement with driving on the left.   As for poor UK regions, first of all the UK GDP per capita is lower than Germany and other Western European countries. Second of all, this inequality cannot be attributed to the EU, because it's the UK government itself that can decide on such things. And lastly, the EU invests in a lot of infrastructure projects in poorer UK regions (Gliders in Belfast, internet, highways and an airport in Cornwall, just off the top of my head) that the UK government isn't willing to do itself. So the EU is actually *improving* this aspect. If the EU funding disappears, these differences will only get larger.   And finally, the UK will be economically worse off in any post Brexit scenario. The deal the UK has right now is really the best deal possible in the current society, it can literally only get worse. So there's no economic reason for Brexit whatsoever.   That being said, I do understand the criticisms about the EU, I just think some of them are overstated, I think think they're not nearly worth the downsides and finally I highly doubt that the UK government is more competent than the EU, especially considering recent events.

The UK, unlike most economies in the EU, is extremely service orientated. And services near always rely heavily on data. Banking, accounting, architecture, you name it, all require the customers data.  As for data passing through any place? Irrelevant. The internet doesn't work that way. Any information passing through the net is split up into so many separate units that you'd still need the whole thing to have usable information. It's basically the main feature and the reason the internet was designed the way it is. The problem is data storage and data protection at the place of storage. That's why many (most?) EU companies don't use servers in the US or Asia. Even if the service would be a lot cheaper, it would basically be illegal for them to di so due to data protection reservations and the resulting EU regulations.  &gt;English soil.

At the very, very, very, very, very, outside best possible long-term scenario after no deal, the UK can expect to recover from the damage of Brexit, then have long-term growth that is markedly lower than it would be if Brexit had not occurred.  Unless, of course, the government decides to either drastically lower or entirely jettison regulations and laws that protect standards in...well, pretty much every conceivable area, such as worker's rights, food safety, environmental protections, product safety, etc, etc, etc.  That way, Britain can maybe compete globally by undercutting a lot of places on price, and this will make a lot of money, for a few at the top.  The lives of most ordinary UK citizens under this scenario, though, will get significantly worse.  How far away from either of those actually ends up happening depends largely on how far away the end result is from a no deal scenario.  The best one requires a massive capitulation from BoJo, with it ending up with a deal that has the UK retaining virtually all of the benefits it currently has, being in the transition period, at the price of still having to carry out virtually all of the responsibilities and obligations.  Or, to put it another, way, getting as close as possible to being an EU member without actually rejoining the EU.  &gt;Imagine being in control of your destiny as a country again.   If you genuinely think that the UK had no power or control over itself as an EU member, then you simply do not understand what the EU actually is.  I suggest you educate yourself on this subject (and no, reading the EU-themed Daily Mail or Express headlines does not count as 'educating yourself on this subject'), as, to people who do understand this, statements like this merely make you sound monumentally ignorant and/or stupid."

Note that none of these procedure provide full legal recourse as it would in an EU jurisdiction. The EU could ask for legal guarantees of course, giving the ECJ the last word if need be (not that the UK would accept that, but then it would no longer be ""adequate"" to share data with, removing the problem in the long run).  In any case, the advice would probably be ""caveat emptor"": when in doubt, prefer a company/data centre under EU jurisdiction over one in a third country.

That debate is especially interesting, IMHO, because Mr. Lamy specifically predicted the problem the UK would face when it wanted to strike trade deals all over the globe: if you lower or remove your own tariffs (what the UK is going to do according to its WTO schedules), other countries have no incentive to open up their own markets to your goods in return. He also predicted what the UK would have to do instead: lower its non-tariff barriers (standards and regulations) in return for other countries opening up their market.  He was right."

It's a classic damned if you do, damned if you don't situation. Essentially, Brexit is about increasing barriers to trade with the UK's closest, most important trading partner.

The only thing the UK can decide is where that cost will fall.  &gt; This is why Tories have failed to deliver alternative trade agreements.  I disagree, to be honest.

They feel that our current standard of living and way of life are a baseline, and can't really imagine any of it going away.  It's going to be interesting to see just how resistant to reality they are.

I imagine that's probably an overly simplistic description of trade negotiations.   Having said that, trade deals are all about access to an economy. The bigger the more lucrative. From what I've seen the EU's prime aim is acting in its members interests in protecting it's market. It was the UK who were banging on about 'they need us' and German car manufacturers.  What other levers are there anyway? We don't really have a navy any more so I guess gunboat diplomacy is out the question.  &gt;I don't see Canada acquiescing to EU laws, and they're far smaller.  What laws are you thinking of? Again probably an overly simplistic description of a trade deal. A quick check shows it took seven years of negotiations and runs to 1634 pages. Something which both parties wanted and signed up to, including rules on dispute settlement.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_Economic_and_Trade_Agreement  I haven't read the EU Canada deal but in the summary the EU says CETA will:  * lower customs tariffs and other barriers to trade between the EU and Canada  * uphold Europe's high standards in areas like food safety, workers' rights and the environment  * respect democracy  You can read it all here. I guess we will have something similar - if we do a deal. Why would we not want the above?  https://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ceta/"

That's in effect what the EU is: a group of countries that agree to follow the same rules, so that we don't need to be concerned about which country has what ideas about how to feed their chickens if we want to move some meat across the border, or electrical compatibility, or a million other things.

He warned that the EU would take a legalistic approach (it has) and would take control of the process to shape it to its advantage (it has).  - That the UK government no longer had an experienced trade negotiation team because that capacity had moved to the EU.

But that only really works if the equivalent good exists and is actually cheaper. Much of what modern Britain consumes is actually imported. So while it’s not going to be impossible for people to switch, they’re going to be making some pretty drastic changes, especially as it regards things like fruit, vegetables, and meats.   Then too is the issue that even with goods that are theoretically built in the UK, like cars or heavy industrial equipment, the parts from which their made are imported. All of this is to say is that the end result is more expense and inefficiencies in an economy which still hasn’t recovered to pre Great Recession productivity levels. Obviously, this doesn’t mean the end of the world, but it does mean the government, so far, has been pursuing a policy which will literally impoverish the strata of society which can least afford it.   On the point about not buying from a country which doesn’t pay the tariff, I’m afraid I don’t understand. With regards to import tariffs, it’ll be UK companies paying the tax, not countries."

In fact, I suspect, you are *deliberately* misunderstanding, because your belief in brexit overrides your ability to rationally analyse the negotiation for a new trade deal to replace the single market membership. It is a normal human thing - we argue for what we've already decided, and rarely relax and let others convince us that what we've already decided might not be correct.  You asked for unreasonable arguments or statements from the UK. How about the UK's chief negotiator. I said that the UK is saying the EU was unreasonable, well, here is the chief negotiator doing **exactly that**:  &gt;Given this reality, we find it perplexing that the EU, instead of seeking to settle rapidly a high-quality set of agreements with a close economic partner, **is instead insisting on additional, unbalanced, and unprecedented provisions in a range of areas**, as a precondition for agreement between us.  This isn't some random ""high ranking EU official"" (by which I assume you're referring to Donald Tusk, after he had left office...), this is the UK's *chief negotiator*. You can read the entire letter yourself, and it comes off as the UK telling off the EU for daring to set terms for access to *their markets:* [https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/886168/Letter\_to\_Michel\_Barnier\_19.05.20.pdf](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/886168/Letter_to_Michel_Barnier_19.05.20.pdf)  The response from the EU was basically: stop posturing, this sort of public war of words isn't negotiating:  &gt;I share your commitment to helping the process move forward together. I do not think, however, that an exchange of letters regarding the substance of the negotiations is necessarily the best way to discuss on substantial points. **It cannot be a substitute for serious engagement and detailed negotiations and, in particular, I would not like the tone that you have taken to impact the mutual trust and constructive attitude that is essential between us.**  The EU is really clear on this, in simple, easy to understand language, without rudeness or demands:  &gt;The EU and the UK are equally sovereign and as such will set the conditions for access to their respective markets. Regardless of what your letter suggests, there is no automatic entitlement to any benefits that the EU may have offered or granted in other contexts and circumstances to other, often very different, partners.  They continue to say the same message they've always said:  &gt;The UK cannot expect high-quality access to the EU Single Market if it is not prepared to accept guarantees to ensure that competition remains open and fair. The EU has been clear about this since 2017.  The EU also points out that the UK keeps asking for access that only a member of the EU can have:  &gt;\[...\] with regard to law enforcement and judicial cooperation, the EU has never previously offered such a close and broad security partnership with any third country outside the Schengen area. Some UK demands in this area go well beyond the well precedented approach it declares to be taking. In particular, UK seeks continued access to EU or Schengen databases. Such access is linked to the obligations that Member States have to comply with and would go beyond what some of them have today.  In private, the UK government leaks the same message over and over:  [https://news.sky.com/story/boris-johnson-eu-trade-demands-are-ridiculous-and-unreasonable-11935283](https://news.sky.com/story/boris-johnson-eu-trade-demands-are-ridiculous-and-unreasonable-11935283)  Or how about the chief negotiator again:  &gt;Chief UK negotiator David Frost today said that the EU’s position would “need to evolve” on key areas such as fishing policy or else the UK will walk away from negotiations, and that Brussels needed to “assess reality” for talks to progress.

All of this is easily researchable. I found all of these previous examples that I had read before but hadn't bookmarked. It was easy for me to find them again. I can go and get all of the other members of the UK government's quotes, which are far worse.

So the funding from the ERDF  helped the middle class more than the working class, who felt left  behind so voted for brexit   If this is what the working class of the north think, then this is, again, a case of perception not matching reality.  The ERDF is actually aimed at redistributing money from richer regions to invest it in infrastructure and services in underdeveloped regions.  Whilst it could be argued that this 'benefits the middle class', that ignores that this is 'middle class help' in the form of supporting and helping businesses, some of which are owned and operated by the middle class, which creates jobs, which helps the working class.  The only real complaint that could be made that actually has some basis in reality is that these jobs aren't generally factory jobs, so the working class might need to learn different skills (which is one thing the ESF helps with) - but expecting all the factories to open back up is just a totally unrealistic expectation that ignores the reasons they closed in the first place.  Frankly, unless these working class people expected EU help in the form of a wodge of money simply handed to them, it's hard to see how they could have been helped more by this EU funding.  As such, what you seem to be suggesting is that the reason why Brexit is so popular in these areas is because people there are blaming the EU for failing to help fix problems caused for them by the UK government, whilst being totally unaware of or just ignoring the help the EU are actually providing."

Successful Northern and Midlands manufacturing output has its head in the block of a Brexit being directed, delivered and implemented by S.Eastern politicians who will of course prioritise the S.Eastern legal and financial services sectors above all else. European prosperity will be undermined by Brexit in the short and long term. That's inevitable. Even worse, the ability of Social Democratic Europe to take on tyranny will also be eroded. That is exactly what Russia and China want. 'Better together', no?  As for the rise of the Far Right and authoritarianism, it is absolutely a problem in Europe and the UK as it is in the US, South America, Russia and China. Sadly, Cameron provided cover and legitimacy for the far-right in Eastern Europe by aligning his Conservative Party with exactly those parties prior to the referendum. The US friend of Brexit, Trump has done the same. The rise in racial abuse in the UK that I experienced in particular since 2016 undoubtedly a direct result of the worst ugliness of the Brexit debate. Electing people who exploit division isn't helping.   Monaco is a retirement home for the rich. But it's not a global player anywhere near the league and clout of the City of London. But sure, I'd do what de Gaul threatened and turn off their water. Same with Lux and I have personal experience of their mob-like laws for laundering assets on behalf of criminal 'businesses'. But then trying to tackle those same business people proved impossible in the UK because the country is too slow to implement EU laws designed to protect people from those British people (or anyone) who break the law across borders. On a note about tackling corruption. When I lived in both Bulgaria and Italy, the British people working in both countries who I met invariably had not registered their employment there (working for UK and Spanish companies), paid no taxes there and lived lives of rolled up local currency tucked into laundry baskets. So yup. There's corruption. British included who see rules as something made for others to jump through. Rarely acknowledged in the UK that there are unregistered British illegals ducking and diving all over the EU.   In my view, the UK financial sector didn't 'pay-up' for the financial crash. The stupid money lent by Wall St, the City, Frankfurt and Paris to commercial property speculators and construction companies on a global scale should have lost them all the shirts off their backs. Instead, those private debts were nationalised onto the backs of taxpayers around the globe who had done nothing wrong. Irish taxpayers will pay for decades. But their political leaders didn't go and falsely blame the poor for the problem, nor the lenders, nor seek political capital. They just got on with it. And higher-rate taxpayers have been paying the social charge ever since to sustain vital public services. When their government proved they could afford the grotesque burden after a number of years, Germany and France dropped their heavy interest rates. The UK did not though."

Grymbaldknight,2020-07-11 03:17:43,fxlm93b,t3_hovuxx,t3_hovuxx,"Most trading blocks are not described by their senior members as an ""Empire"", do not dictate where and when members nations may catch fish, do not legally regulate manufacturing, do not have foreign aid budgets, do not have environmental policies, and do not have foreign policy aims or a desire to control the military forces of their member states.    Most trading blocs... y'know... regulate trade between members, and nothing else.  Compare the EU with the WTO: The only thing the WTO does is regulate trade. That's it. Meanwhile, the EU has its sticky fingers in all aspects of government policy, and is trying to accrue greater powers by the day.  The EU seems to be expanding into a federation, of sorts. To say that ""the EU is a nation"" isn't entirely true... but it's becoming less and less far from the truth by the day. This is a problem.  To address the other point, though, i'm fully aware - as a Brexiteer - that the UK won't get access to the single market now that it's outside the EU. That's fine. The reason the UK isn't agreeing to what the EU is offering is because the UK doesn't want that either. Neither side wants to pay when the other is charging, so they won't sign a deal.    It's less a case of brinksmanship, and more a case that we've got 6 more months of this, so why should each not try and get something out of the other? Might as well do something to kill time, if only because it looks bad publicly if both sides say ""Nah, fuck it."" with months still to go.  Will this negatively impact the UK economy? Eh, it's very possible, especially following COVID-19. However, i maintain - for the reasons above - that the EU isn't worth being a part of anyway. The EU is a deeply, irredeemably flawed organisation, and i would rather be poor than be a part of it.  (Before anyone says anything, i work in a supermarket, so i'm not speaking from an ivory tower when i say that i would ""rather be poor"", etc. I'm very far from rich, and yet i would still rather leave the EU and suffer the economic hit, if need be.

I will use GDP as an indicator. It's probably not the best, but easy to think about.  With Brexit the two statements will most likely be true: - GDP in the EU will decline due to Brexit - GDP in the UK will decline due to Brexit  So the result is a negative sum. Now the EU's goal is to keep the EU decline as small as possible. This is achieved by reducing the incentives for companies to leave the EU to the UK and to make companies to want to leave the UK for the EU. This is achieved by putting up trade barriers and/or ensuring that there is no advantage of being in the UK over the EU (e.g. no huge cash bonus for moving from the UK government)."

It is a harsh truth when it comes to international negotiations, of any kind, really, when there is a significant size disparity, as there clearly is here, it is the smaller country that loses out most if negotiations fail, and that inherently gives more leverage and power to the larger one.  In this hypothetical, it would be as if the UK was a moderately sized country, economically speaking, that already had an existing comprehensive deal with an utter behemoth that covered trade, along with many other things, but was seeking to renegotiate this deal.  There's only three possible outcomes of this from the smaller country's perspective:  1)  Decide it was a bad idea and keep what you had.  This, of course, would depend on whether the other side have any objection to the waste of time and effort.  In this case, the last realistic chance for this scenario has been passed by.  2)  Come up with alterations that they do not object too much to, and will agree to, recognising that it may very easily get to the stage where proposed changes are too much trouble for them to bother, given the size disparity.  So far, the UK government has been negotiating as if the UK is just as big and important as the entire EU, so have been making frankly ludicrous demands that the EU have zero interest or reason to entertain.  3)  Cancel the existing deal with no replacement.  You don't exactly have to be one of the world's leading economists to understand that, in any situation like this, it will extremely likely be a much worse result for the smaller party than the larger one, but the consensus amongst the world's leading economists is that this definitely holds true here."

There are many reasons why it might be a lot less: - Hauler licenses might only cover 1 in 20 trucks. That would mean down to 500 trucks. So they can park each truck for a week. - Trade might move from trucks to containers, where possible - There will be less trade - Trade from EU is replaced with trade from overseas. Also means containers instead of trucks - Trade will go EU -&gt; Ireland -&gt; Northern Ireland -&gt; UK, this way they avoid all ""hard"" borders - British trucks are no longer allowed in the EU due to the side their steering wheel is on (I'm not sure if this might actually happen, I read it somewhere, might be a joke)."

Any Brexit that removed the UK from the single market (this use be called Hard Brexit) would necessitate a border either on Ireland on or in the Irish sea.  Theresa May and anyone else can say everything they like about it being unacceptable, but geopolitical realities doesn't give a fuck about what they find acceptable.  In 2015\~16 it was a possibility that we would have a border fiasco.  By Jan 2017, after Theresa May's Lancaster House Speech laying out UK's conditions for Brexit, it was almost a guarantee that we would have a border fiasco (because the red lines laid out would 100% remove the UK from the single market).  At that point the only question was whether the border fiasco would occur on the Irish sea or on Ireland itself.  This was blatantly obvious 3.5 years ago.  BoJo didn't create this border fiasco, he only decided when and where it would occur.  Even if he didn't bow to EU's demands, it would merely shift the problem from being at the ports of entry to the land border between NI and RoI."

dragonaute,2020-07-11 23:10:52,fxrqzkb,t3_hovuxx,t1_fxrmcbv,"&gt; Incorrect. A nation is the highest level of sovereign power.   You just don't get it.  All member States are sovereign. They sovereignly transfer some competence to the EU, notably regarding trade. Its members can also sovereignly back the competence that they sovereignly transferred to it, as the UK has recently done.  The EU is not sovereign. It can only act within the limits of its funding treaties and is headed by the Council, which is made of the members' heads of State (or governement depending on who actually leads the country), deciding unanimously.  The negociation is between 28 sovereign equals. 27 of them have decided to have a single representative, whose mandate is provided by the Council and is imperative. Michel Barnier cannot agree more than what he was allowed to in his mandate.  In addition to that, the trade agreement with the UK is a mixed agreement, which means that it does not fit completely into the competence that the sovereign member States have delegated to the EU. So it will have to be ratified by the EU for the competence that the member States have transferred to the EU, and by all 27 member States for other matters."
SkyNightZ,2020-07-11 23:48:40,fxruwky,t3_hovuxx,t1_fxrqzkb,I do get it. I get 100% the angle you are going for. It however doesn't fit.  We are negotiating with one body. We are not negotiating with 27 countries. We are negotiating with the EU itself. Which collects its powers from the 27 countries which is the internal debate you are talking about.  The EU is a soveriegn power by the definition no matter how you want to slice it.  Sovereign - possessing supreme or ultimate power.  EU court of justice is just that.

dragonaute,2020-07-12 00:29:13,fxryyf4,t3_hovuxx,t1_fxruwky,"You do not know what you are talking about.  In political theory, sovereignty is the authority that a governing body derives from itself and over itself, and the EU does not have that. The EU's authority derives from its member States. Not a single State in the world recognises the EU as sovereign. The UK does not recognise the EU as sovereign.  The EU has no supreme or ultimate powers. The member States have. In the EU context, the supreme or utimate power is the one to adhere to or withdraw the treaties. If the EU were sovereign, brexit could not have happened without an act of authority of the EU. The EU merely ackowledged the UK decision and had no say in it, because it's not sovereign, while member States such as the UK are.  The UK is negociating with 27 countries who stand by each other's demands. Ireland has demands about Northern Ireland, Spain about Gibraltar, France, Netherlands, Germany, Denmark and Sweden about fisheries. If the agreement is not good enough for Gibraltar, it's the Spanish Cortes that will refuse to ratify it, not the EU parliament. The FTA with Canada almost collapsed because Belgium did not want to ratify it.  Michel Barnier's negociating mandate does not come from the EU, because if it were he would be mandated by the Commission. It comes from the Council, and the Council means the member States.  The EU Court of Justice is a Court created by the Treaties to settle disputes about EU laws. If all member States withdraw from the Treaties, it will cease to exist. It has the ultimate say on EU law matters because this has been agreed to by each member State, and only for that reason."

That is something that I and my colleagues in the ERG would very much support.""  &gt;The report, published by the new Centre for Brexit Policy, includes contributions from Lord Trimble, the former first minister of Northern Ireland, Martin Howe, the Brexiteer QC, and Owen Paterson, the former cabinet minister who chairs the think tank.  &gt;The key elements it says make up the ""poison pill"" include the UK having to remain bound to some state aid laws, the creation of ""burdensome EU customs mechanisms"" at a border in the Irish Sea, a role for the European Court of Justice (ECJ) for another eight years, and the vast divorce payments, for amounts the report states are ""not owing under international law"" and are ""subject to the determination of the ECJ"".  &gt;The report states: ""Although the Government sees the revised Withdrawal Agreement (WA) as only transitional until the end of the transition period in December, there remain serious threats to UK sovereignty that will have crippling economic and strategic consequences for years to come if they are not dealt with now.  &gt;""Exiting the TP with these threats still in place will not return the UK to a fully sovereign state and is unacceptable.""  &gt;The report urges Mr Johnson to replace the Withdrawal Agreement with a ""sovereignty compliant"" agreement. A chapter by Lord Trimble states that the current deal ""rips the Good Friday Agreement apart” by handing law-making power over Northern Ireland to the EU.  &gt;The paper's recommends returning to the Brexiteers' plan of ""alternative arrangements"" to achieve an ""invisible border"" on the island of Ireland and using independent adjudication.  &gt;A government spokesman said: “The Government’s approach ensures businesses in Northern Ireland will have unfettered access to the rest of the UK market and that there will be no tariffs on goods remaining within the U.K. customs territory and no new customs infrastructure.  &gt;“Crucially, at the heart of our proposals is a consensual, pragmatic approach that will protect the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement and the huge gains from the peace process.”"

It is highly likely the trade negotiations will fail and what will they do then to get their fifteen minutes of fame in the tabloid press? Attack the Withdrawal Agreement, of course. Undermine it's legitimacy. Make the UK government refuse to implement proper border controls in the Irish sea. And then, when the EU protests, double down on the aggressive rhetoric.  And when the inevitable ECJ order to implement a proper border comes, the cry will be ""foreign judges telling us what to do"" and ""why would we uphold the WA when the EU has not given us a trade deal"", ... The WA and the Irish sea border will become political poison and the UK government will want to distance itself from both before it suffers the same fate as Mrs. May's government did.  And then the UK breaks the WA and everything falls apart. They'll probably move on to attack the ECHR at that point, but who knows.

Here we go, lots of popups and autoplay videos in a difficult to copy/paste format:   ..........   This is why we left! UK nears HUGE Brexit free trade deal - as India issues WARNING to EU BRITAIN and India look set to begin talks on a huge free trade agreement - with New Delhi issuing a warning to Brussels.   India said trade talks were possible with both the UK and Brussels - and said it was up to both negotiating teams to ""pick up the gauntlet first”. Talks between India and the EU stalled in 2013, with the UK now able to leap ahead of Brussels in the queue as an independent state.   Piyush Goyal, India’s Minister of Commerce and Industry, said: “We’re talking to the EU and I am in dialogue with the EU trade commissioner.  “I am looking for an early harvest deal. Open to discussion of a variety of subjects.  “It’s up to the UK and EU whoever picks up the gauntlet first.”   Over the last six years, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government have been trying to push exports through various programmes but has not succeeded.   Last year, India pulled out of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership amid fears over China’s access to its markets.  New Delhi has also been placing trade barriers to stop cheap imports from China and replaced them with their own locally made goods for domestic consumption and exports.  Mr Goyal believes their locally sourced produce could help engage trade talks with the UK.  He added: “Apart from pharmaceuticals, we have textiles, handicrafts, leather, furniture, industrial machinery, toys are areas where India can engage with UK &amp; EU at competitive prices.”   This potential trade agreement comes after it was announced Turkey was “very close” to signing a post-Brexit free trade agreement with the UK.  Last week, Turkey's Foreign Minister Melvut Cavusoglu met with Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab in London.  He said while there were no differences over a potential agreement, there are some technical issues that need to be ironed out.  Mr Cavusoglu told the Financial Times: “It’s going very well and we are very close to finalising it.   “If you look at the volume of our bilateral trade, 95 percent of it is industrial products, and we agreed on that, and five percent is agriculture and services.  “We agreed already with the UK that in the post-Brexit era we will increase our bilateral trade; in volume we set a $20billion bilateral trade target.""  International Trade Secretary Liz Truss and Trade Minister Ranil Jayawardena will meet with Turkey’s counterparts next week.  The latest round of talks on a post-Brexit free trade deal between London and Brussels ended on Thursday, with significant differences between the negotiating teams still remaining.   But if no deal has been agreed by the end of the transition period on December 31, a trade deal with Turkey could face a major dilemma.  As Turkey is a member of the EU customs union, any FTA deal with the UK would only be implemented once Britain has signed a trade agreement with the EU.  After Germany, Britain is Turkey’s second-largest trading partner and a FTA deal would be crucial for Turkish manufacturers, including carmakers, textile factories and white goods producers.  The Office for National Statistics said trade between the UK and Turkey totalled £18.8 billion last year, with £7.9billion in British exports, and £10.9billion of Turkish imports to the UK.   There are more than 2,500 UK companies operating in Turkey including BP, Shell, Vodafone, Unilever, BAE Systems, HSBC, Aviva and Diageo.  Around 400,000 Turks are currently living in the UK and many have benefited fro, the Ankara Agreement.  The Ankara Agreement, which Turkey signed with the European Economic Commission in 1963, allows people from the country to work and establish businesses in Britain.  Mr Cavusoglu said they are looking at two separate agreements, one is the FTA and the other is similar to the Ankara Agreement.   (clears cookies, washes hands)    &gt;As Turkey is a member of the EU customs union, any FTA deal with the UK would only be implemented once Britain has signed a trade agreement with the EU.  lol."

The UK decided unilaterally to leave, and notified its decision to the EU, who could not refuse it.  &gt;First article 50, has it's power from the EU as a collective.   No. Article 50 as its power over 28 nations (and now 27) derived from the fact that it is in a treaty that was ratified by these 28 nations (now 27).  &gt;The EU isnt a rag tag team of countries that convene and are then the EU only when they are present.   The EU is a sui generis supranational body created by treaties, which are sovereignly entered into by its member States. It contains nothing more than what those member States have agreed to in these treaties.  &gt;No... The EU voted on the withdrawal agreement.  Yes. As did the 27 member States, who ratified it individually according to their national procedures for ratification. But the UK would have left even if there had not been a withdrawal agreement. No permission from anyone was needed.  &gt;I'm not making the claim that the EU is sovereign in the sense of it being a nation. That's fucking obvious. I am saying the EU executes sovereign power that Trump's that of it's member nation's.  No, because the EU derives its power from the fact that the member States sovereignly gave this power to the EU, and can withdraw it from it, just as the UK did.  &gt;It's a sovereign power as it's derived from all the members. It above member states because if any member nation breaks an EU law they will be fined by the ECJ.   But this only happens because the member States sovereignly decided to submit themselves to the ECJ jurisdiction and associated penalties when they entered the treaties.   &gt;There isnt a vote between the nation's first on how to do ithe EU and it's associated bodies operate independently from the sovereign powers of the member states.  Certainly not. The EU is headed by the council, who is litterally made of the sovereign powers of its member States.  &gt;The UK is in fact negotiating with the EU. I'm not fucking dumb. Obviously the EU members are being represented. But the fact remains we are negotiating with the EU. Barnier is not a French rep, not German rep. He is a rep of the EU.  Michel Barnier is a negotiator appointed by the Commission, but has a negotiation mandate which specifies what he can and cannot negotiate. This mandate is given to him by the Council, that is the 27 member States. He negotiates on behalf of the 27 members.   &gt;I don't get how people can honestly pretend that the EU holds no power all of its own.  Because it's true?  &gt;That would be like saying that the house of commons has no sovereign power because it derived it's power from the people who are actually sovereign.  Actually, in the British legal system, the sovereignty does not lie on the people, but on the Queen-in-Parliament. So yes, the house of commons has a sovereign power. If you wish to have a relevent analogy, the house of commons devolves part of its power to Scottish authorities, but can also sovereignly decide to withdraw what it has devolved. It does not mean that Scotland has no power (it has indeed the power that is devolved to it by the UK) but it does not mean that Scotland is a sovereign country."

VOTE  ### BORIS JOHNSON has been urged to renegotiate the Withdrawal Agreement with the EU otherwise he risks jeopardising Britain's sovereignty. But what do you think, should the Prime Minister rip up Theresa May's treaty and start afresh? VOTE HERE    A new report has highlighted the Withdrawal Agreement (WA) negotiated by [Boris Johnson](https://www.express.co.uk/latest/boris-johnson)'s predecessor, Theresa May, contains [several ""poison pills"" which will jeopardise Britain's hard-won freedom from Brussels control](https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1308222/brexit-news-EU-trade-deal-boris-johnson-uk-withdrawal-agreement). Furthermore, the 100-page document by the Centre for [Brexit](https://www.express.co.uk/latest/brexit) Policy (CBP) warns the deal will cost the UK a staggering £165billion.      The document, titled 'Replacing the Withdrawal Agreement: How to ensure the UK takes back control on exiting the transition period', highlights several areas the UK must stand firm on.  Such matters that require prioritising include the Northern Ireland Protocol, EU citizens’ rights, the controversial £39billion divorce payment, future financial liabilities, EU data protection laws, EU geographical indications of origin which are not reciprocal, and provisions relating to UK sovereign bases in countries like Cyprus.  The group also pointed out the Government must not cave to EU demands and allow the bloc to fish in British waters - an important red line for many Brexiteers.  John Longworth, Director-General of the CBP, said: “The British public repeatedly voted to ‘take back control’ and to ‘get Brexit done’.      “But we are now in the fine print stage of our departure from the EU and close examination of the terms agreed by former Prime Minister Theresa May and only partially improved so far by Prime Minister Johnson reveals that we are a still long way from fully restoring our national independence.  “We must ensure that our future relationship with the EU does not undermine our right to take our place on the world stage like other independent nations, free to cooperate with friendly countries but not to be controlled by them.”  Britain's chief negotiator David Frost had already admitted the Government was trying to overcome flaws in Mrs May's original deal.  He said Mr Johnson was unable to renegotiate the whole WA after he became the UK's premier, as there wasn't enough time to discuss the deal prior to Britain leaving the EU on January 31 this year.     The CBP agreed with Mr Frost, and the document serves as a blueprint to correct the flaws in the original agreement.  Former Northern Ireland First Minister Lord Trimble wrote the foreword to the CBP's report pointed out the WA far-reaching consequences for Northern Ireland.  He wrote, “the Withdrawal Agreement clearly rips the Good Friday Agreement apart” by undermining the principle of consent, handing law-making power over from Northern Ireland to the EU so that “there is no way in which the people affected by those decisions will even have a say in the making or application of them.”  Former Brexit Party MEP Matthew Patten has urged the Prime Minister to rip up the deal agreed by Mrs May.     Writing for the Sunday Express, he said: “To regain our sovereignty, Boris Johnson is going to have to rip up and replace the agreement he signed just six months ago that enabled us to withdraw from the EU, set up the transition period, and describe the possible parameters of a future trade agreement.”  The 100-page report also highlights that much of the British public are adamant that leaving the EU must result in a full restoration of UK sovereignty.  The document highlighted a poll carried out by Savanta ComRes on June 8.  It found people in so-called battleground ‘Red Wall’ seats won off Labour by the Conservatives in the December 2019 election believe that leaving the EU will give Britain back independent sovereignty, by a margin of 49 to 26 percent.      This level of agreement rises to two thirds among ‘Red Wall’ residents who voted Labour in the 2017 general election then switched to the Conservatives in the 2019 election – and nearly three-quarters of people who voted Conservative in both elections.  People were responding to the statement: “Leaving the EU in 2020, rather than later, will mean that Britain recaptures the national independence it had before it joined the Common Market in 1973 sooner.”"

By attacking the EU or denouncing ""treason"" of the one true Brexit. Currently, they are busy agitating against making any compromise with the EU in the trade negotiations. Consequently, the trade negotiations are increasingly likely to fail.  What will these people do when the FTA talks fail and the UK leaves without a deal? Start putting actual work into creating policies to implement Brexit in the faint hope that this will get them noticed in the press? Or will they continue what they have been doing for years and will they just seek out the next target to attack. My money is on the second possibility, and the next obvious target is the Withdrawal Agreement.  They will put pressure on the UK government to break the treaty (formally or informally), probably by refusing to properly implement the Irish sea border. The question is whether the UK government will resist them. If it does, Mr. Johnson can expect to be stabbed in the back in the same way Mrs. May's government was. Of course, the ""easy way out"" for the UK government is to take the most radical anti-EU position themselves to outmanoeuvre the radicals. Sooner or later, this will bring them into trouble with the EU.  And when the EU protests? More aggressive rhetoric. And when the inevitable ECJ challenge is made? ""foreign judges telling us what to do!"", ""dictats from Brussels!"", ""sovereignty!"", ""we signed the WA but got no trade treaty in return!"". The WA and the Irish border will become political poison and the UK government will be swift to distance itself from either, causing the UK to break the treaty.  And then everything falls apart.  Everything hinges on the UK government's will to make a stand for the UK's reputation as a trustworthy partner and resist the demands of the radicals in its own party to break the WA. Take a look at the people making up this government and you'll know how thin the thread is that keeps everything from crashing down."

Unless you are prepared to actually specify what the 'deeper moral flaws within the EU' actually are, you are simply asserting that there are reasons for not being in the EU, but not actually giving them, and assertions without detail or evidence are not really going to convince anyone.

Both will blame the other for the new border, but I doubt the UK's point of view will be shared outside its borders.  As a direct consequence of the latter, there will be an immediate political crisis in Northern Ireland as the Good Friday Agreement will fall apart. Note that the people who will be furious about the new border have no incentive to blame either the EU or Ireland for it, so they will blame the UK government no matter how the latter attempts to deflect the blame. I would also expect a negative international response from certain other countries (e.g. the USA), but, to be honest, that will be peanuts to the damage inflicted by the effective severing of relations with all the UK's neighbours. In addition, any countries the UK wants to sign an FTA with will probably think twice before doing so, because the UK will then have a history of breaking international treaties when politically convenient.

There are, I believe,  a few exceptions for national security related work.  However each country is free to decide for itself the conditions that apply to non EU nationals, the EU has no say in this.  Although, in practice, companies may have preferred EU nationals over 3rd party citizens this was just because the countries own immigration laws imposed restrictions making hiring them more complicated. But any EU member state is perfectly able to allow hassle free immigration to any group they wish. Of course that only applies within the host country not the rest of the EU so a company might still prefer EU nationals as makes it easier for them to travel, and relocate if needed, elsewhere in the EU."

There are those voices and the balance of payments deficit, combined with a state deficit push the UK into this direction. However, I don't count Longworth to this camp. For his faction, Brexit is an end in itself and not a tool for something else. It is an unapologising call for hegemony, internally and externally.   Internally, in that way that opposition is crushed and their point of view isn't and can't be questioned anymore. Their pretty vague goal is some sort of Downton Abbey, Victorian age world.  Externally, in that way that their introspectivity rules everything. They are so obsessed with their postcard idyll, that they aren't able to adapt to the world abroad or even recognise it. Everything orbits around your lovely Tory shire with green grass, sheep and hedgehogs and around the world metropolis London.  That this world never existed in this way, and was built on one-sided ""free trade deals"" which were the legal foundation of the Empire, is a footnote, they have unfortunately forgotten.  That all might sound a bit dreamy, unrealistic, detached from the world, harmless and innocuous. But if you are really determined to (re)create this world, it implies a reckless and brutal foreign policy. In the end, also the Generalplan Ost was a dreamy, unrealistic thought piece, where happy Aryans cultivate their lands in the East, helped by their grateful Slavic servants, transforming the Volga basin into the Germanic Mississippi. That is no endorsement, but shall show how barbaric, inhuman, criminal and genocidal policies can be dressed up in a tempting narrative.   So much to this Brexiter faction. I deem them as highly dangerous.  &gt;The real driving force, however, remains the political ambition of the people in power.  Well, Johnson wants to be Prime Minister.

But there is barely any trade between canzuk countries (ignoring NZ-AUS, but they dont need canzuk), companies dont regularly send technicians or sales reps on a 40+ hour round trip for a quick intervention or meeting.  Freedom of movement can be beneficial for one or both parties if there is a discrepancy between countries in education and skills, available jobs, demographics. When the UK needs nurses and young workers and fruit pickers, and Eastern European countries need experienced engineers.  But if you are going to trade one dentist for another,  or one plumber for another, the main point of canzuk appears to be brexiters looking for another sunny place to retire, now that Spain is no longer an option, or a place to flee to when the Uk economy comes crashing down.

Likewise, there may be up to 200,000 HK Chinese settling into the UK soon.  Can you see Australia saying yes to unrestricted migration into your country then?  I honestly don't see it and think a trade federation between Fiji, the UK, Uganda and Panama is not only more beneficial but also more likely. **FUKUP** will be spanning a massive area and four continents, the possibilities for trade will be limitless. Fiji's fish, the UK's financial services, Uganda's coffee and Panama's canal will make for economic synergies that will outgrow lesser, more restrictive trade blocs like the EU in no time."

WannabeeFilmDirector,2020-07-13 22:15:04,fxz5f92,t3_hql0nd,t3_hql0nd,"What's worse is you have literally no idea how bad it can get.  Pre-EU (pre treaty of Maastricht), I was a trade clerk in a bank.  I specialised in cherry pickers but ended up with importing kit into France ranging from ice-cream makers to computers.  The paperwork for one computer was slightly mis-labelled so it was held up at customs for six months.  Other stuff was just left to rot.  The bottleneck in France was Poitiers.  The goods would arrive on the coast, get transported 300 miles inland and then 'examined' in Poitiers where there were 100,000 products shared by just six lazy and pissed off customs officers.  I think it was six but it always seemed to be the same two or three absolute abstards I was dealing with.  They threatened to arrest me, deport me etc... (I was on a carte de sejour which was a type of working visa in France).  We sent a good looking girl down to dig something or other out and when she returned, they refused to say what customs had said to her.  It would've been something sexual because that's what they were like.  Goods would get held up, smaller businesses would have serious problems and larger ones would simply have to deal with this mess.  Germany was the hardest because their rules and regulations were so strict.  It cost businesses a ton of money, aside from the paperwork, visas etc... which cost a ton of time and money.  When I was working there, we wondered how anyone in their right mind could have made up the rules which were a mishmash of stupidity and insanity.  No-one could possibly want to go back to that.  See, being part of the EU gives businesses the ability to tell customs to get lost.  We make the product, ship it and sell it.  That's it.  Going forward, it'll be hell.  As for my business, it'll certainly take a chunk out of it.   No question.  But the chunk won't come out of my side, rather I'll simply hire less people, pay less taxes and my staff will suffer.  That's the reality of Brexit.  Brexit means less jobs, less money, less power and less tax money for services like the NHS or schools.  But blue passports eh.  Which weren't originally blue.

They are so vile that WTO even has a treaty on them.  France used to protect its electronic industry against the Japanese in the 80s and 90s by insisting that all electronic goods from Japan be declared at a singe customs post, hundreds of km inland. So everything had to be shipped in, loaded on a truck under seal, driven inland, unloaded at the customs compound (the theft rate at customs compounds is always impressive), cleared in, and then loaded up again.  The French then manned that post with customs agents that were 6 months away from retirement.   \---  Another barrier is certification. UK goods will require extra certification, which will delay time-to-market. And in this day and age, if an electronic gadget's launch is delayed by a couple of weeks, it's outdated by the time it hits the market."

So it gets the a mandate from the members of the EU and negotiates based on what those nations agreed they are willing to trade.

The slightly more thoughtful answer is 'because any positives have yet to manifest themselves.'  As regards this latter - I have started to think of Brexit as being something like the race to get a man on the moon. Its not a perfect analogy by any means, but I go with it regardless - we are at the very early stages of trying to get a rocket up in the air, we've blowing ourselves up on a regular basis, learning all the time but with lots of things still to learn, and yeah, lots of people are resenting the costs, asking whether its all worth it, and whether or not getting to the moon will actually be of any benefit anyway. In short - at this stage of 'R&amp;D' there arnt any particular positives to report, and many negatives to consider.     It is of course quite possible that there will NEVER be any positives: time will tell. Its quite certain that there will be a LOT more negatives before any positives appear: whether or not Brexit turns out to be a success is something for historians to argue over in about 100 years time."

strealm,2020-07-14 13:19:06,fy17wxw,t3_hqzru0,t3_hqzru0,"It is either this or dishes...  &gt; Leaving the European Union is, I’ve often argued, a bit like moving house.   A good narrative always starts with a metaphor that has something to do with situation at hand. In this case - a house on wheels.  &gt; Instead of being lodgers under someone else’s roof we are choosing a new place in the world where we’re in control.   I'd argue that the situation in the world is a bit more complicated.  &gt; Four years after we made the decision to leave the EU, the reasons for moving are stronger than ever.   0 x 10 = 0  &gt; With control of our economy, we can continue to put in place the right measures for Covid recovery.  I can wash my dishes...  &gt; Taking back control of the money we send to Brussels means we can spend it on our priorities: investing in the NHS, spreading opportunity more equally across the UK and strengthening our Union.   I could also clean my flat...  &gt; We can build a trading relationship with our European neighbours that serves all our interests and develop new economic partnerships across the world.  I could also have a sexual relationship with my hot neighbor, if only there was a minimum of understanding on the other side.  &gt; The deal the Prime Minister struck last year, and which the country backed in the general election, ensured we left the EU in January and means we can look forward with confidence to the end of the transition period on December 31.   I'm sure everyone is excited, one way or another.  &gt; But, just like a house move, we need to make sure all the practical arrangements for our new future are in place.  But first you'll push the house in general direction of Dover.  &gt; Everyone has their part to play, starting with the government.  Haven't you done enough?  &gt; That’s why on Sunday we’re investing £705 million to make sure our borders are ready for full independence. We’re investing in new infrastructure, more jobs and better technology to help goods move smoothly, make our country more secure and our citizens safer.  Obviously not.   &gt; The money will ensure that Great Britain’s new borders will be ready when the UK takes back control on January 1 2021, and will also lay the foundations for us to build the world’s most effective border by 2025. Modernizing our border means we can introduce a migration policy that ensures we’re open to the world’s best talent.   Less talented smugglers will get arrested.  &gt; A new points-based immigration system will ensure we can attract the scientists, innovators and entrepreneurs who can power future economic growth.   Everybody is attracted by more paperwork. Good thing that points-based immigration system will block out most of them.  &gt; It will also help us ensure our NHS has the very best professionals from across the world working in our hospitals. And the new technology we’re introducing will allow us to monitor with far greater precision exactly who, and what, is coming in and out of the country, enabling us to deal more effectively with organised crime and other security threats.  Also in 2025?  &gt; Alongside the investment we are making in infrastructure we’re also launching a major new public information campaign, “The UK’s new start: let’s get going” to give everyone the facts we need to be ready for January 1 2021.   I think I peed myself a little.  &gt; Whether you’re the managing director of a multinational conglomerate or a family business; a UK citizen resident in the EU or planning to work abroad, the new campaign will clearly set out the steps that will help this big change go as smoothly as possible.  A straightforward checker tool at gov.uk/transition will quickly identify the specific steps any business or individual needs to take to be ready, and will allow companies and citizens to sign up for bespoke updates.   There is really no need to rub it in their face!  &gt; Taking these steps will equip everyone for this new chapter in our country’s story. Helping businesses adjust to life outside the EU Customs Union will enable them to more easily access the new opportunities being an independent trading nation will bring, such as those presented by trade deals with the Japan, Australia, New Zealand and other growing Pacific economies as well as deeper ties with North America and the developing world.  North America? Deeper ties?  &gt; We’re negotiating hard, of course, to get the best possible trading relationship with our neighbours in the EU but we won’t back down on the essential principles the country voted for when we chose to leave. We won’t accept control of our laws by the EU or allow our new-found independence to be compromised. Whatever the nature of our trading relationship with the EU we’ll be outside the single market and the customs union – and that means the preparations for new export arrangements and new border processes will be needed whatever the negotiations bring. These have been challenging times for our country, but, as the Chancellor reminded us this week, Government can help lay the foundations for recovery and future growth. That’s what we’re doing this week as we prepare for our new life fully outside the EU. We’re building the border that allows us to take back control. Let’s get going.  Brace yourself.  &gt; Michael Gove is Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster  Ah, some ceremonial position. I worried for a moment."

I'm thinking about all those NHS European workers that came to the UK using that very mechanism they so much hate.  I'm not even sure they've got that. I know you're talking about what they can legally do, but the actual result could be different.  For example I'm not sure the EU will try to avoid people crossing at Calais anymore, since why should they care that those guys are going to the UK?  Also, if they are not in a good position to negociate treaties with other countries, this could end up having an impact on their frontiers in the future: if the £ drops a lot, they will have an interest in getting a lot of people spending their precious € and $ in the UK."

I disagree with you on that point: the majority of people who voted for Brexit were not prepared to wait 100 years for the benefits of it.  Let's a have a little thought experiment: suppose in 30 years the UK decides to rejoin the EU, this time integrating fully with it (adopts the €, etc). And suppose this generates great benefits. Do you think that 70 years later, your same historians would say ""See? Brexit was a success since it forced the UK to rejoin the EU later, which they would never have done""."

Indeed, one could argue that the majority of leavers didn't give a damn what the economic fall out was, the important thing for them was getting a 'leave' vote in the first place, and hanging onto that over three years of wrangling and a general election -  on that basis, they have already achieved the 'success' they were looking for in the first place.    And yes, cynically - in your hypothetical scenario, I think there is an excellent chance that future historians will argue that had the UK NOT voted leave, it would never have been forced to undertake the social, legal, political and philosophical changes it needed to allow it to rejoin and participate as a full member and reap those benefits.

Indirect taxes which the EU already has control over are for example Vat and excise duties. Once the EU has control of direct taxes they are entitled, having established competence in that area over corporation tax, to extend to income tax. These are the  well established facts of competence extension and represent archetypal mission creep by the EU.  As things stand member states have a veto to prevent EU responsibility over all direct taxes. The EU plan is to use a treaty article which was never intended to be used to take control of direct taxes, to establish control of direct taxes. How do we know it was never intended to be used this way? Because direct taxes have always been under veto control of member states by treaty.

British people will still be able to go and work in the EU; to live; to travel; to study; to buy homes and to settle down,” he said. “The only change – and it will not come in any great rush – is that the UK will extricate itself from the EU’s extraordinary and opaque system of legislation.”  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;“There is a European free trade zone from Iceland to the Russian border and we will be part of it… Britain will have access to the Single Market after we vote leave… The idea that our trade will suffer because we stop imposing terrible rules such as the Clinical Trial Directive is silly.”  The Immigration Bill isn't compatible with either of these statements from BJ and Vote Leave."

Zmidponk,2020-07-14 18:55:48,fy2c2c1,t3_hqzru0,t1_fy19do1,"The points-based immigration rules were brought in as part of the argument that Brexit was supposedly needed for the UK government to 'take control of borders' to cut immigration, as the UK was being hurt by immigration being too high.  However, there are three problems with this:  1)  There is quite a bit of evidence that throws severe doubt on the whole idea that immigration is or was actually a problem for the UK, not least the governments own Migration Advisory Committee, which [released a report](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/741926/Final_EEA_report.PDF) that suggested that there is no clear evidence of any harm caused by immigration, and some evidence that immigration was actually of a net benefit to the UK - particularly immigration from the EU and EEA.  2)  Even before Brexit, immigration from outside the EU actually exceeded immigration from within the EU.  If immigration was too high, that's the logical place to start, and there are/were no EU rules stopping this.  3)  There are EU rules that the UK government could have used to cut EU immigration and/or target EU immigrants who were actually a burden to the UK, instead of a benefit.  We know this because other EU countries actually enforce these rules.  Successive UK governments have chosen not to.  So, basically, the Brexit immigration argument is that Brexit was needed to solve a problem that didn't actually seem to be a problem, but would have been solvable without Brexit if it was.  Oh, and, on sovereignty, this is a direct quote from the UK government's own [White Paper on Brexit](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/589191/The_United_Kingdoms_exit_from_and_partnership_with_the_EU_Web.pdf):  &gt;Parliament has remained sovereign throughout our membership of the EU"

The reason why it happened is because the ultra rich and corporate world wanted those benefits so bankrolled the whole xenophobic propaganda campaign to engineer it.   Corporate Benefits: - deregulation, resulting in lower bureaucracy costs. Many of the regulations are there to protect the consumer but without them, operating costs will drop.  - zero employment regulations: making it easier for companies to hire and fire - lower manufacturing standards, meaning higher profits - tax benefits: individual companies will be able to broker deals for tax with the government. That would be illegal in the EU, as Apple found out in RoI.   It’s not just corporations that will benefitEconomic turmoil will hugely benefit the rich: - disaster capitalists can profit from shorting U.K. businesses - cash buyers can swoop on discounted insolvency properties - foreign investors can massively benefit from arbitrage if sterling crashes. (I live abroad, and my UK costs have already dropped)  Brexit would never have happened if it was to no benefit. Unfortunately, the beneficiaries are few, and most people will have to suck up the cost of the economic segue change which is now locked in."

You are talking about taking large corps away from Ireland. A country which is English speaking, a highly educated workforce and has free market access to all of the EU to be replaced with a 3rd country.  A 3rd country with completely different regulatory framework that refuses to conform to the extremely large market that surrounds it. How will those business sell their services to Europe?  The UK can conform to EU rules or it won't trade with the EU and they will make damn sure of that. So where is the attractiveness in putting a business in the UK if you have no trade deals? Will the WTO save you? No, because it doesn't even cover services. Even if the UK conformed to the rules, it's a 3rd country so it won't get even close to the level of free trade Ireland will get.

Hardly so the rest of the Eurozone wouldn't have noticed had they done due diligence though. Everybody knew the numbers presented were rosier than the reality but political considerations were allowed to dominate.   Had the troika not bailed them out it would in many cases have meant their banks wouldn't be repaid as well as interest rates rising sharply for other eurozone members.  The UK does in fact shoulder some of the blame for WW2 due to the (in retrospect) rather short-sighted Versailles treaty.  I'm not trying to shift blame from Greek (or German) shoulders but in the case of the Greeks their were plenty of crocodile tears from those whom shared in it."

However the design of the Eurozone and the fact that the Greeks were admitted despite everyone knowing that they didn't qualify means that there is some blame to be shared. Nothing happens in a vaccume. Also the bailout was as much, if not more, due to the rational selfish interest of the others as much as enlightened charity.  I say that as a Swede; we sent money to Greece despite not being in the Euro which I support but I do blame my leaders slightly for not keeping an eye on (and being publicly honest about) Greek finances. Anyone  who was actually shocked that Athens was lying would be guilty of negligence."

I say that because my prediction is that income disparity will grow by a margin, with trade barriers in place imports and exports both will struggle, investments will drop and eventually SME will starve.

Their finances were pretty opaque from the very beginning. As in too opaque to qualify for the Euro.  As for the Eurozone leaders (and the other EU leaders) then; yes, I would blame them for that lack of imagination. They have no business weilding power on the international stage if they're that naive/uninformed. The world is full of countries that should not be allowed a knife when in your home. Many can't even be trusted with the damn spoon.  As to how much guilt I'm rather unsure and certainly unqualified. Considering the sheer number of people sharing in the lesser blame it should be quite low individually. I doubt many would go much higher than 10% for the cumulative non-Greek guilt. Maybe Goldman could be given a higher bracket. I'd probably go lower myself (unless one blames ""the system"" which is basically just blaming everyone).  My point is that it's basically lieing by omission by not challenging obvious falsehoods. Much like when FOX interviews Trump. Why not lend the DPRK money otherwise? They say they can pay it back.

VirtuaMcPolygon,2020-07-15 17:55:08,fy60haw,t3_hqy7t1,t1_fy0qtz7,Depends if you play 4D chess... I’ve stated above that the Apple ruling is a pretty damning decision. Being the EU you could say was illegally trying to standardise members corporate tax rates via stealth ignoring the treaties.  People say the EU is governed by rules but seems happy to break them when it sees fit.   The bigger question is was the 12 billion expected added to the EUs predicted budget.   If so this puts even more pressure on the EU to get a deal with the U.K. and the UKs ears will be pricking up to say they will offer low taxes on tech firms. Unless the EU play ball.   So in a round about way. Yes it’s Brexit related.   Ultimately to many federalist are in the seats of power within the EU for EU not to gain control of domestic members tax rates via a treaty change. Ireland is on borrowed time with its 12.5 rate

Glancing-Thought,2020-07-15 18:02:56,fy61hcj,t3_hrio98,t1_fy5m59h,I'd argue that technically any government is partly socialist. A government that has no control over any means of production is generally not called a government. While this might be considered semantics it is kinda the word and it's definition that's up for debate.
VirtuaMcPolygon,2020-07-15 18:05:40,fy61u11,t3_hqy7t1,t1_fy0w1i6,See my comment above in another reply. The irony is the EU was found guilty of in its own courts for attempting to break its own treaties for a power grab of domestic members tax rates.   This is far from a race to the bottom. It’s more power gain via stealth. Ultimately the EU will win on this. Federalists will be clinking glasses of champagne the day that happens as the Ireland’s tech revolution is toast bankrolled on its 12.5 rate. Malta would also be screwed over by the EU.   The whole thing the EU fears is the U.K. being a tiger economy that can be fluid with taxation to promote growth which is completely alien to the EU. So yes it’s Brexit related as the U.K. will be droning this point on to barnier fully well knowing the U.K. can be a problem in the long term as the EUs ambitions are to be federalist.
Zmidponk,2020-07-15 18:45:50,fy66z9o,t3_hqzru0,t1_fy2u97v,"The point-based system is only possible because of Brexit, yes, but it is something that is simply not needed, because, as I already pointed out, it 'solves' a problem that doesn't actually seem to be a problem, and, even if it was actually a problem, it could have been solved in a different manner that does not require Brexit.  Also, given the points-based system is explicitly about blocking the access of low-skilled workers, and it is very clear that the UK economy actually needs low-skilled workers from abroad, it is actually going to create problems.  In fact, it kind of already has, despite not being implemented yet, as the government has had to find ways to make loopholes and exceptions in their wonderful new scheme for certain agricultural workers."

In the modern economic climate I don't think it's realistic to think we're a couple of good policies away from the rest of the country not needing London. I wish that was true but really London is only rich thanks to international business and most of them are more likely to move to Amsterdam or Frankfurt than Leeds or Norwich, so it's gonna be one-way traffic for the foreseeable future.

I don't need to give a collection of reasons if you claim that the UK ""cannot hope"" on account of **your own** unspecified collection of why it can't, when there are smaller countries which don't have the same advantages as the UK, but which have assumed the position they have primarily based on cheaper labour, incentivised innovation, the business environment and a more motivated workforce.  Sterling, UK labour and investment in the UK is about to become even cheaper, and it has a means to suck up the best talent from every developing economy of the world.
