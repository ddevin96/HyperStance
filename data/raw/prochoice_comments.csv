OceanBlues1,2019-12-31 13:01:43,fcmy5gw,t3_ehzit5,t3_ehzit5,"Dr. Gu rocks!  Unfortunately, many ""prolifers"" seem to believe a woman is ""supposed to"" be a walking incubator, and nothing else.  Which is why they have no problem whatsoever with stripping women of our most fundamental right; the right to decide for **ourselves** whether to be mothers or not."
pauz43,2019-12-31 15:00:59,fcn6dmj,t3_ehzit5,t1_fcmjlr4,"&gt;the foetus has the right to use her body in later months  Do all humans have the same rights as a seven-month fetus? Why should that fetus have more rights than a father of four or a woman who is a cardiac surgeon who saves lives *if both are in organ failure?*  If a fetus can use someone else's body against that person's wishes ""in later months"" then adults in kidney failure should have the right to demand a healthy kidney from the nearest donor -- whether the ""donor"" agrees or not!   Tell us, birdinthebush74, if *you* would willingly hand over one of your non-vital organs to another human... on demand. How about all those who agree with bitb74's statement? Are YOUR organs up for grabs? Or just the organs belonging to pregnant *women?*"
parkahood,2019-12-31 15:28:39,fcn8ntq,t3_ehzit5,t1_fcn6dmj,"Yeah, um. What? You can revoke consent to an organ donation until you can no longer raise an objection. Like, they can be wheeling you into the suite and you can say no and they have to stop, even if the recipient is already in surgery and doesn’t have another shot.  Suddenly we give the fetus rights to someone else’s body when it wouldn’t apply in any other situation? We don’t compromise on human rights like that. Either everyone has the same rights or they don’t.   Some places don’t have term limits, are those places violating the fetus’ human rights?"
FairyKite,2019-12-31 16:47:32,fcnfupg,t3_ehzit5,t1_fcmjlr4,"I respectfully disagree that the fetus should ever have rights to the woman’s body. Nobody else has the rights to anybody else’s body at any point, no matter how developed they are. If a dying five-year-old doesn’t deserve access to his parents’ kidneys, or a dying pregnant woman doesn’t deserve an organ donation from the person who got her pregnant (despite it saving the life of the fetus too), why would the fetus eventually gain more rights than the woman?"
birdinthebush74,2019-12-31 16:58:56,fcnh17s,t3_ehzit5,t1_fcnfupg,"I agree with you, but pragmatically we need a cut off date to appease the 'middle' of the debate.  Also  after 24 weeks the foetus can be delivered anyway. I of course do not include threats to the health of the women or severe foetal abnormalities in this restriction"
birdinthebush74,2019-12-31 17:07:15,fcnhvg6,t3_ehzit5,t1_fcn8ntq,"I am looking at this as from a pragmatic point of view, later abortions are unpopular with the majority, even those identify as prochoice. Obviously this does not include severe foetal abnormalities or threats to the women's health or life."
parkahood,2019-12-31 17:19:34,fcnja6w,t3_ehzit5,t1_fcnhvg6,"I would argue that this sort of cut off gives the fetus rights we don’t want to give it. Can fetuses be victims of neglect? Are women violating their rights if they continue to take their medication or have a glass or wine?   And abnormalities and threats to life have proven to be so subjective, and that puts people in danger.  Both of those concerns are just as pragmatic. I don’t think that kind of concession does anything but allow for people to shove a foot in the door. Pro-lifers already do that; using a few edge cases to push and push. I see your point; I just don’t agree."
pauz43,2019-12-31 17:26:38,fcnk7av,t3_ehzit5,t1_fcn8ntq,"&gt; Either everyone has the same rights or they don’t.   Apparently, the fetus is more ""special"" than the rest of humanity. OR... restrictions on abortion are a clever way to punish women for not wanting to be pregnant and refusing to do fulfill their ""biological destiny"".  Somehow, women always end up holding the brown end of the stick when men make the rules."
VampireStereotype,2019-12-31 18:57:30,fcnugk4,t3_ehzit5,t1_fcmjlr4,"I normally have a lot of respect for you, Bird, but this is absolutely not okay.  Conditional human rights aren't rights, they are privileges. We, pro-choice people - pro-women people - believe that women deserve basic human rights. Agency, bodily-autonomy, self-ownership. All of these things are rights our culture grants as a matter of course to men. And yet even here it's apparently controversial to suggest that women should have these same most basic rights.  ""Term limits"" are a denial of women's most basic human rights.  The foetus categorically does *not* have the right to use ""her"" body, my body, your body at any stage."
manatorn,2019-12-31 18:59:25,fcnunsf,t3_ehzit5,t3_ehzit5,"I always come back to this excerpt from PP v. Casey:  &gt;Men and women of good conscience can disagree, and we suppose some always shall disagree, about the profound moral and spiritual implications of terminating a pregnancy, even in its earliest stage. Some of us as individuals find abortion offensive to our most basic principles of morality, but that cannot control our decision. Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code.   &gt;   &gt;...   &gt;   &gt;These matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. Beliefs about these matters could not define the attributes of personhood were they formed under compulsion of the State.   &gt;   &gt;These considerations begin our analysis of the woman's interest in terminating her pregnancy but cannot end it, for this reason: though the abortion decision may originate within the zone of conscience and belief, it is more than a philosophic exercise. Abortion is a unique act. It is an act fraught with consequences for others: for the woman who must live with the implications of her decision; for the persons who perform and assist in the procedure; for the spouse, family, and society which must confront the knowledge that these procedures exist, procedures some deem nothing short of an act of violence against innocent human life; and, depending on one's beliefs, for the life or potential life that is aborted. Though abortion is conduct, it does not follow that the State is entitled to proscribe it in all instances. ***That is because the liberty of the woman is at stake in a sense unique to the human condition and so unique to the law. The mother who carries a child to full term is subject to anxieties, to physical constraints, to pain that only she must bear. That these sacrifices have from the beginning of the human race been endured by woman with a pride that ennobles her in the eyes of others and gives to the infant a bond of love cannot alone be grounds for the State to insist she make the sacrifice. Her suffering is too intimate and personal for the State to insist, without more, upon its own vision of the woman's role, however dominant that vision has been in the course of our history and our culture.***  (emphasis mine)"
sloweyarole,2019-12-31 19:18:47,fcnwn9a,t3_ehzit5,t3_ehzit5,They cannot give someone a right to life if it violates another persons right to life and bodily autonomy. Life isn’t worth living if you can’t control your own body.
hadenoughoverit336,2019-12-31 19:23:06,fcnx4u9,t3_ehzit5,t1_fcmjlr4,"Or, a doctor decides what's best for their patient at that point. If a doctor believes that continuing the pregnancy would be detrimental (mentally, or physically), they decide the best way to end the pregnancy. I think early induction should still be an option, if they think the pregnancy is viable. That makes the most sense. Otherwise, you will have women throwing themselves down the stairs. Guess what the end result is of that?"
hadenoughoverit336,2019-12-31 19:24:46,fcnxbuv,t3_ehzit5,t1_fcmjlr4,"I do get what you're saying, but the law would have to be written in such a way, that it gives doctors the right to use their discretion."
Ruefully,2019-12-31 20:23:50,fco4c2e,t3_ehzit5,t1_fcnh17s,"I agree with you. I think cut off dates are to appease fencesitters and moderates. If you actually think about it, PC slogans on a protest sign communicate so much and make such strong points. It's too bad they are ignored.  ""Trust Women"" There's so much meaning in two words. But we don't trust women (yes even many women, considering all the PL women or women who further their internalized misogyny). We don't trust women or PL wouldn't continuously attack abortion through late term abortions, despite the fact we all know that women seeking abortion at that stage are doing it for health reasons.   That's because we all know that if a woman has an unplanned pregnancy, she wants to abort as soon as possible. If late term abortions don't happen for health reasons (I have no data on how many late term abortions are elective in the one or states it is legal, back me up if you like) then you can bet PL had a hand in it. It is in no one's best interest to make abortions harder to get."
Ramesses-ll,2019-12-31 21:56:57,fcod9vk,t3_ehzit5,t1_fco4c2e,"&gt;We don't trust women or PL wouldn't continuously attack abortion through late term abortions, despite the fact we all know that women seeking abortion at that stage are doing it for health reasons.  Why fight for a right you have no intention of using, and in the process of fighting risk alienating the middle?   Uk has 24 week limit unless health.     The straw man of ‘aborting viable pregnancy’ can’t be used in uk cos it isn’t asked for by reasonable advocates."

o0Jahzara0o,2020-01-01 00:19:41,fcopas8,t3_ehzit5,t1_fcnugk4,"I think she was more commentting on the spirit of Roe v. Wade.    I personally believe abortion should be legal and accessible at any point during pregnancy. At no point does a woman stop owning her body based off the gestational age of the fetus.     But I accept how Roe is set up because I think that the issues Pro-life are concerned about with late term abortions tend to resolve themselves. They think that women just randomly decide they change their mind and will kill viable fetuses. But we all know that doesn't happen. Those abortions tend to take place on women with wanted pregnancies who no longer can continue because of health problems or the fetus is no longer viable.    So I think Roe sets it up to where women most certainly do have full human rights, but let's Pro-life know that their (ignorant) fears aren't being carried out."

nosleepforthedreamer,2020-01-01 04:10:31,fcp68vg,t3_ehzit5,t1_fcnunsf,"I don’t think trashing one’s body and throwing away freedom to give life to a nonexistent being is noble. I do see why people want to see it in that light. Society has always come first, not the individuals who are the reason for society’s existence. So to make themselves comfortable with humanity depending on these things from people, they had to tell themselves that the incubators were heroes."
Brownie-1234,2020-01-01 05:10:41,fcp9sgq,t3_ehzit5,t1_fcp5y92,"More like when we have it in the Constitution that women are full people. The Equal Rights Amendment simply states “Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex”. Yet misogynists won’t allow it to be passed because if women are considered full people under the law you can’t force them to be used as reproductive slaves, irrespective of what day of pregnancy they’re in."

OceanBlues1,2020-01-01 12:29:18,fcq9t51,t3_ehzit5,t1_fcp5v8e,"&gt;*Right, they keep saying stuff like it’s biology and women are made to give birth.*  Which is a big **so what** in my book.   It doesn't -- and shouldn't -- mean that women are to be restricted from doing anything else.  You know, like getting a college degree and beyond that, if some women choose.  Like getting a high-income career, which allows women to have their own money.  Like buying, if they choose, their own house, **without** a man having to ""provide"" it for them, and choosing to avoid marriage and motherhood entirely in favor of living as single, financially-independent women.   That last choice really seems to make some male ""prolifers"" go ballistic."

To add on: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-el-salvador-suicide-teens-idUSKCN0IW1YI20141112 &gt; El Salvador’s ban on abortion is driving hundreds of girls who become pregnant after being raped to commit suicide every year because they see no other option. El Salvador is one of about 28 countries globally that prohibits abortion in all circumstances, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights.  El Salvador has one of the highest rates of teenage pregnancy in Latin America, with girls aged 10 to 19 accounting for nearly a third of all pregnancies in the country last year.Many of these girls face the unwelcome prospect of giving birth to an unwanted baby due to El Salvador’s total ban on abortion even in cases of rape, incest, a deformed fetus or when the women’s life is in danger.  &gt;“There’s a correlation between sexual violence and the high rate of suicides among adolescents. Pregnancy is a determining factor behind teenage suicides.” Teenage pregnancy is one of the leading causes of suicide in the Central American country of 6 million people. Three out of eight maternal deaths in El Salvador are the result of suicide among pregnant girls under 19, latest government figures show.  &gt;Under Salvadoran law, it is a crime to have sex with a child under the age of 15, but activists say the law is frequently flouted, citing official figures that show 1,540 girls under 15 became pregnant in El Salvador last year.The offense carries a prison sentence of between 14 and 20 years, but few perpetrators are sent to jail."

Some of them are literally discussing how it’s all well and moral for this girl and anyone like her to die, even if they’d had access to abortion. Literally they think it’s awesome that the girl dies for the “innocent” fetus, because even though the girl died, she wasn’t “killed” like embryos in abortions. I’m so fucking disgusted. Someone go tell Veritas-whatever that if “pro-life” thinks it’s moral for any woman capable of conceiving to consciously suffer and die, they’re not pro-life.

In what sense are we failing to be objective?  women are more than 50% of the human race, and we are advocating for this majority of the human race to be granted basic human rights because it is demonstrably preferable to the alternative.  To the extent that any ethical argument can be said to be objective, I think this one qualifies.  History has shown us time and again that excluding some specific group of humans from having the same rights as other groups leads to a demonstrably less just, less felicitous society for the majority of the population.

Science tells us that there is no pain felt by the fetus.   Philosophy tells us that a woman’s rights come before an embryo.   Anecdotal evidence tells us that parents who are forced to birth their children end up being bad parents.   Reality tells us that most kids age out of the foster system and end up being homeless.   There is documentation on the fact that the adoption industry is very much for profit and flawed in several ways.   But yes you are “brainwashed” lol.   I wonder if sky daddy’s representatives wouldn’t have equated birth control and abortion to murder if they would still hold these beliefs.

But... babies are born at 28 weeks and survive all the time. If a doctor were to perform the same procedure on a 28 week old outside the womb, it would be considered infanticide. This is why the ""moderate"" position exists, and I don't think it makes one a ""fence-sitter"" or not truly pro-choice to not think abortion should be allowed for any and all reasons after the fetus is capable of surviving on its own."

I couldn't do anything on my own, other than force myself to get up. I was in agony. I couldn't pick my daughter up on my own. I couldn't breast feed. I needed help getting dressed.  I had no comprehensive care guide, on how to make moving around easier. I was discriminated against due to my age, and the fact that I was on Medicaid. I was totally, and completely unprepared.

Prokinsey,2020-01-08 23:51:40,fdlmord,t3_elwrdg,t1_fdl34jd,C-sections are anything but easy. You either take the intense pain upfront with labor or you take it in recovery with a C-section. Either way there's going to be some extreme pain and they don't give you an epidural to take home during recovery.   Pregnant/birthing/postpartum people are neglected. No method of birth fixes that.

I've had clients go in for planned Cs and come out with the same experience. The worst C-section recovery I ever saw was a planned C in a major, high-quality hospital. She was in bed, not moving, 1 day PP, and losing her mind over the pain when I visited her. She wasn't even due for pain meds yet. Some people can't lift their arms above their head without intense pain even years later. Some people end up with endo in their scar. They can nick an artery, bladder, or bowel.   Few things piss me off more than people saying C-sections are ""easy""."

A c-section has a higher complication rate than an indiction of labor, D &amp; E or D &amp; X. The complication rate is about 10%. If a pregnant person is very ill those risks are higher. A woman is more likely to die from a c-section than any abortion performed by a trained provider.  Sometimes at 25 weeks there is no chance of survival. That is why you go to OB/GYN or pediatrics school, to learn when a fetus has a chance after birth  Abortion is sometimes needed at or after 24 weeks. Sometimes a c-section is even an abortion.

Yes, there isn't a guarantee that the baby will live, but to say that it wouldn't become a child is farfetched theory.  To your second point, you could force a miscarriage, but if you have to force a miscarriage then there is the thought that the pregnancy would result in a baby. You don't force something unless you think something will happen.  Lastly, you say that evert pregnancy will severely hurt the mother carrying the child. If it is a severe situation like you said that happens with every pregnancy, then how do a lot of mother's live normal lives like anyone else?"

(not that I was given the choice, he was rushed to nicu)  I had to stay in the hospital for 2 days.  Once the  catheter was out, I was asked every 2 hours how much I peed.   If I didn't pee enough I couldn't leave the hospital and a catheter had to go back in.   I was not allowed to do anything for 6-8 weeks, all I could do is hold the baby.  I had to get the staples removed, oh btw I couldn't drive so I had to have someone take me to all my appointments. I was 100% useless.  It's been 4 months and I still don't have all the feeling back, and I have to keep up matiance as there are bald spots.  OH and my abs don't exists anymore, I have to do physio too.

So many of our ancestors died or were forced into motherhood when they didnt want to be.

We as a species became so used to the status quo, the thought of women not wanting motherhood as a given at any point in her life just disgusted some of us. We couldnt deal with this existential dread at the thought of our loving mothers, submissive wives, not wanting to play that role. So we demonized them. And oppressed them.    Indeed, it is 2020.

Because if more girls and women do know, they could decide to go the childfree route, and the ""prolifers"" don't want that happening.    So, they purposely minimize or even dismiss the dangers of pregnancy and childbirth, saying anyone who calls attention to those dangers is ""demonizing pregnancy"" or ""fearmongering."""

Forcing them to be mothers is how we get adults who hate themselves and have to exert an enormous amount of energy just to function in society. Even if the mother sucks it up, provides for the kid, doesn't abuse them, etc, the child can *always* tell if they're not wanted.

And that’s if we are lucky and they recognise us as above the threshold to count as sentient.

Their parents might have never damaged them, **but they created it,** and are therefore generally considered to be responsible for taking care of it.

What about a driver who drives slowly and carefully and, through NO fault of their own, hits someone? Nothing is expected of the driver—no jail time, no lawsuit. Being drunk while driving—something that is both illegal and immoral—is a necessary condition to taking away the driver’s right to freedom or money. Sex is neither illegal or immoral. The fact that you are equating the two signals to me that your perceptions of wrongdoing and responsibility are severely warped. Sex is not wrong. I’d suggest you try an analogy where the actor does something that isn’t inherently wrong/illegal and still has freedoms revoked or consequences to face, but I don’t think you can.  No. 2: The airplane analogy. I can’t believe you just equated a woman’s body to “property” (“dependent on my property to stay alive”)? Why don’t we just eliminate the crime of rape and call all instances “trespassing” from now on? Jesus. In any case, to your analogy—yes, I could toss my friend out of the plane if he pulled a knife and said “I’m about to put this in your vagina tear it a few inches,” and tossing him out the plane was the only way to stop him."

Inflicting bodily harm or death on an aggressor to protect yourself, on the basis that they instigated the situation where your rights are in conflict, is fundamentally no different than forcing the mother to carry the baby, where she created it, and is thus responsible for causing the situation where their rights are in conflict   &gt; it also never agreed to be gestated or to be born  Now that it has already been created, it has a right to life.  You have trouble distinguishing between action and inaction. To not abort it, and continue to allow it to inhabit your body, is not doing anything to it. To kill it, is to do something to it.  Birth is not a significant event, the fetus does not undergo physical change after birth. Rather, birth is merely the fetus waking up and exiting the womb.   So birth isn’t exactly doing something to it, the fetus is just exiting the mother’s body.    Also, if it decides that it didn’t want to be born, then it always has the option of committing suicide later in life. It has no choice if it gets aborted."

Repeating something over and over doesn't make you right.  I directly addressed that with the newborn analogy.   Just because it's naturally that way doesn't mean she wasn't responsible, had she never had sex, it wouldn't have been created and been dependent on her.   When someone creates a fetus, they are creating someone that is helpless and needs their body to survive.   &gt; Is a person at fault for their kid having some rare genetic disease that makes their organs fail?  Presumably they didn't cause their kid to have a rare genetic disease.  &gt; No parent is obligated to donate organs to their kid so you lose.

CanadianAsshole1,2020-01-13 03:51:16,fe6d6ur,t3_ena525,t1_fe5yx3s,"&gt; through no fault of their own, hits someone  That is more akin to a woman getting pregnant from rape, in which case she is not responsible for creating the child. Abortion would be permissible in this case.   I don’t think sex is wrong, merely that it could carry consequences that you must live with should they occur, because to do otherwise would infringe on the rights of another(the fetus). She hasn’t done anything wrong if she gets pregnant and keeps it. The abortion is the immoral act,  not the pregnancy.  **However, even if she didn’t do anything wrong, she is still responsible for putting the fetus in the situation where it is dependent on her to survive because she created it. Therefore, the fetuses rights should take precedence.**  &gt; I don’t think you can  Because pregnancy is such a unique situation.  The best analogy I have, which I didn’t include in that post, is self defence.  Inflicting bodily harm or death upon an assailant, in self defense, is typically justified on the basis that the assailant is the reason why your rights are in conflict. Letting him attack you results in your right to self ownership being violated. Attacking him to defend yourself results in his right to self ownership being violated. Your rights take precedence because he was the instigator, he caused the conflict in rights.  Now, the same logic can be applied to abortion. Even though the mother may have not done anything wrong in creating the fetus, she is still responsible for putting it in a situation where it is dependent on her to survive. She is the reason why the fetus’ right to self ownership(and by extension life)and her right to self ownership are in conflict."
CanadianAsshole1,2020-01-13 04:03:16,fe6e3cx,t3_ena525,t1_fe6d5on,"**Why do you keep ignoring the newborn analogy?**  Are parents not responsible for their newborn’s helpless state because they are that way naturally?  The basis for legally mandating that parents care for their children is that their children are not capable of caring for themselves, and the parents are responsible for that because they created someone that cannot care for themselves.  So “that’s the way it is naturally” is not an argument, even though it’s completely natural for the fetus to be non-viable, she still created it. The fact that the non-viable state of the fetus is natural and the idea that she is responsible for that because she created a non-viable person are not mutually exclusive.   Repeating the same thing over and over again doesn’t make you right."

I never argued that parents financially supporting their kids is the same as parents sacrificing their bodies. The analogy was merely to show that they are responsible for the fetus' non-viable state.  So from there, it logically follows that the right of the fetus to live trumps her right to self-ownership, since she is responsible for why their rights are in conflict. From one of my other comments:  &gt; ""this is no different from self defence.

I edited my comment to elaborate on your points here.  1) Men cause 100% of unwanted pregnancies, through consensual and nonsonensual sex (rape). No woman is getting unexpectedly pregnant on her own . Men are necessary for UNWANTED pregnancy, but not necessarily for wanted pregnancy. Further, consensual sex is NOT consent to pregnancy.  Look..I say this because the only way for a man to ensure abortion does not happen in his life is to practice abstinence or get a vasectomy. If you're a man, I'm trying to help you since you apparently hate abortion this much.  2) Yes. And they often do. However, just like sex is NOT consent to pregnancy, sex is also NOT consent to fatherhood.  So, if we want to legally absolve men from their actions, then abortion should be legal, accessible, easy, affordable - even free - for women.  But it's not, thanks to mostly male politicians.  Get on it.  Go preach to them.   3) How cavalier. Pregnancy is always a health risk. It's a labor, a sacrifice. Do you even know what goes on during a pregnancy? Vomiting, the gestational diabetes, hemorrhoids, bowel problems, incontinence, genital tearing is common for healthy pregnancies. Not to mention recovery time and lost income, since paid maternal leave is not guaranteed. The maternal mortality rate is rising in the United States, as well.  Abortion is much safer than pregnancy and childbirth by far.  No offense, but I think it's really weird you think you can force a stranger to remain pregnant against her will, or that you even want to."

I know I keep talking about human rights, and about the need to not let the conversation be steered away into irrelevant red herrings, but that's mostly for the benefit of fence-sitters.

That obviously will not work most of the times. Jordan Peterson explains it pretty nicely (although I don't think he would like how I used what he said) when he says that to believe means to act on that belief, not just say ""I believe"".   Than you have to understand that a lot people still carry the judeo-christian mentality where the concept of woman's consent doesn't exist. There are rules where they are treated as things (you break it you buy it).   Nowadays with modern secular morality most of almost everyone says they consider women equal to men, but a lot of people still acts on the judeo-christian philosophy. Just like 100 years ago all the cultural people would say they love and respect women, but would also laugh if someone told them they should have a right to vote.

Eev123,2020-01-15 20:29:09,fehnjht,t3_ep3ygz,t1_feh3d4r,The fact that you use this argument and *admit* to misunderstanding consent is disgusting. How dare you tell other women what they consent to. Take your rape apologia elsewhere.
BestGarbagePerson,2020-01-15 20:47:13,fehpf5u,t3_ep3ygz,t3_ep3ygz,"It's not a distraction, this is what they genuinely think. The problem is they are engaging in special pleading, to treat sex as if it were a legal thing but at the same time a pregnant person is treated as if they are a criminal.  That is, you can lose your right to your own body, if you consented to some unlawful act which put others in danger. They consider sex this ""reckless"" act, for which a woman should lose her rights as a result, just for engaging in in the first place.  I have literally had pro-life people repeatedly tell me that consenting to sex itself is *endangering* a fetus, and *forcing* a fetus into existence in the first place, which therefore warrants a woman to be treated as if she is kidnapping a fetus into existence by being pregnant. (OFC they never go so far as to admit the kidnapping part - although I think maybe once that happened years ago with a conversation I had with a pro-lifer on twoxchromosomes but I digress)  Pro-life people will never agree that sex should be a crime, so they go towards some kind of ""duty of care"" by consenting to sex.   It really does hinge on their moralizations that sex is a shameful/dangerous/bad thing that no one should ever have for pleasure and that women who get abortions are abusing the ""responsibility"" of sex.  There are number of ways one can engage with this but I often ask pro-life people if sex is consent to a duty of care that involves guaranteed blood loss, why is it not a draft (and thus, women are paid for their service, just like anyone in the military is, by law?)   Because even with a duty of care that parents have to their born children, no parent is criminalized for protecting their own body from blood loss and trauma, *even from their own children.*  So if sex isn't a reckless crime of endangerment against fetuses, and it's not a draft then what is it?  Because it's not consent. After all a fetus doesn't even exist when you consent to sex with a man. How can there be consent to someone who doesn't even exist when the consent happens, based on the chance they might appear later? And then only then, only if the chance entails they implant in a uterus? And then the right to continuous consent, which all legally abiding people have, is removed if you are a pregnant person?   This is a strange definition of consent, that is only being used in the case of pregnancy people and fetuses. All you have to do is point that out repeatedly in all the ways you can, and hope that you will eventually educate people out of their irrational thinking and ignorance of how the law works.  Often when I get to this point, I hear the appeal to nature fallacy as a justification for the ""special case"" of pregnancy. To whit, I usually tell them what it is they're doing, or if I feel really snarky, I ask them if they want to live in a world where ""nature"" is more important than organized laws, they should go live in a cave with some rats and chipmunks, away from human civilization."
pauz43,2020-01-15 20:54:52,fehq7sf,t3_ep3ygz,t3_ep3ygz,"They'll refer to the fetus as a separate human with the right to life. Which would be fine IF everyone was forced to donate non-vital organs to transplant patients.  Why is the survival of a fetus more ""precious"" and important than the survival of a dialysis patient who needs a kidney or a bone cancer patient who needs a bone marrow transplant? If the law allows a fetus to use my body against my will, then it should permit dying children and adults to demand the needed non-vital organ from the nearest person who is a genetic match!  A day-old infant can't demand his or her biological parents hand over a body part to save the infant's life; why should a woman be forced to allow a fetus to use her body and threaten her health for nine months?"
BestGarbagePerson,2020-01-15 21:05:46,fehrcwa,t3_eozt8p,t3_eozt8p,"Found this information from the boise subforum 4 years ago.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Boise/comments/3t3ypw/in_todays_segment_of_whateverhappenedto_brandi/  &gt;Not a bad synopsis of crazy! When I think of Brandi Swindell I think of 3 things. 1) chaining herself to the 10 commandments monument to keep the city from moving it out of Julia Davis Park. 2). Arrested in China during the 2008 Olympics for protesting in Tianamen (sp?) square with her ""Christ is King"" banner. I believe it was about abortions and human rights. Ballsy move but incredibly stupid. China detained her and kicked her out. 3). Protesting at the state capital a couple years ago to get a bill passed that would require all women to have a vaginal ultrasound prior to an abortion. This included a live exhibition of a vaginal ultrasound being performed.  &gt;She pops up in the news occasionally and is kinda like the Westboro Baptist (in personality &amp; politics) of Idaho.

Of course trolls like that are irritating, but a response like the one I mentioned from a pro-choicer, actually makes me feel worse. Even if the person's intention was good, ignorance sometimes makes me physically nauseous lol.

They didn't impress this upon me, unlike is the case with most former insufferable goody-two-shoes, so I'm still not sure where I got this behavior from. (My mom was actually libertine to the point of emotional incest, so I think this was my way of trying to get her to stop.) Did you also try way too hard to go in the opposite direction once you got older?  &gt;And even if you do everything right and still get pregnant unintentionally it’s no reason to spend eternity beating yourself up.  Exactly. I can't imagine being an entire senior citizen and being emotionally bound to a decision I made as a late teen. Even though she's harassing other women, I genuinely hope this woman gets the help she needs and is able to move on and live the rest of her life in peace."

The fetus can be removed using forceps without the woman having to endure labor or be cut open.   “When the cervix is dilated enough, the uterine contents are evacuated. This is not a delivery and our patients do not need to push.”  I have also read that clinics like Hern’s can stop the fetal heartbeat and then allow a woman to fly back to their own doctor to actually go through a labor if their doctor does think that is a better option.  And in an emergency doctors might have more lee way in how to extract the fetus without making the woman go through surgery or labor that a doctor couldn’t do if the abortion was needed because of fetal abnormalities.  Edit: Also looks like according to the law a D &amp; E is only illegal federally if a fetal heartbeat is present, that is why doctors like Dr. Hern stop the fetal heartbeat first."

And FYI to any ignorant anti-choicers lurking - even patients who are sectioned can choose whether or not they want an abortion, at least where I live anyway. It is there legal right to do so. I know this because I spent a decade working in secure mental health services and we had a few patients who ended up Pregnant, only one opted to keep the Pregnancy. It was 100% her choice and we helped arrange legal paperwork for the baby to go into the custody of her parents until she was well enough to be discharged, we also ensured she was able to go and visit her baby several times a week providing she was well enough to be escorted out and taken home. Those who had an abortion had a staff member (for supervision) and a family member/friend there for extra moral support if they wanted.

Also, I've said this nine million times, but ""consent to sex is consent to pregnancy"" is a rapey statement. The same thinking gets you ""consent to kissing / having a drink with me / letting me buy you dinner/ whatever is consent to sex."""

The second day was more laminaria to dilate my cervix further. The third day the laminaria was removed and I was given pitocin and misoprostol to induce labor.

Contraception is a clear desire not to have kids (or at least not at the wrong time). It isn't perfect like abstinence, but abstinence is not practical for everyone.  Pro life acts like abstinence has always been an ideal. It isn't. People have always wanted sex without pregnancy.  &gt;Loss of life  Most abortions are done when it's not complete yet.

If I stop taking it, my pregnancy compounded with my illness would rob me of my health for years down the road.  This is a non exhaustive list. Even wanting a baby won't make these go away. Pregnancy should not be an obligation: women aren't obligated to be self sacrificial saints.  If your answer is ""good medical care gives no excuse for abortion"", needing a hospital at all means it isn't not a big deal: I should have a say on my body.

It's an incremental process. I don't relate to something that doesn't have a brain yet. You focus in the future, I focus on the present. I relate to women who never wanted to be pregnant and have kids. I empathize with women whose doctors tell them they can't carry any more children, or she'd die.*  Women aren't obligated to be pregnant. Women aren't obligated to be saints at the drop of a hat, sacrificing themselves.  *If she redeems herself, by denying herself an abortion and dies/becomes disabled, she is no saint at all for not being able to be there for kids she already birthed into this world. Half of women who have abortions already had kids.  &gt;Nobody is asking you to stop having sex, just use something to stop yourself from becoming pregnant. Again, the pill has a 99.7% effectiveness rate, there are even male pills being passed! Use a condom and a pill, PP gives out a bunch.  With birth control you need to look at two rates: failure with typical use and failure with perfect use. Typical use of the pill is about 91% or 93% effective."

Jellyfish are living; no brains.  But people eat jellyfish...  &gt;fact, I don’t see you arguing that mentally challenged individuals are less human than everyone else  The issue is with the fetus tethering to a woman's body whether she likes it or not. And compromising her health and quality of life. More people agree that killing a newborn is abhorrent, than people can agree on abortion.  &gt;what makes a zygote any different.   There is a reason doctors get more strict with abortion after 24 weeks: pain receptors. Without a brain it can't comprehend, without pain receptors it can't feel pain. If the woman still needs an abortion for whatever reason, it is anaesthesized before abortion.  &gt;Nobody is forced to be pregnant (except rape), nobody forced you to have unprotected sex, nobody decided that they were going to force you to undergo a pregnancy. YOU CHOSE IT  A woman can like dick in her vagina. She may even like ejaculate. But that doesn't mean she wants to be pregnant. It's called taking the third option.  Banning abortion would force women out of a safe abortion. The ghastly consequences of diy abortions clearly did not stop women from terminating.  &gt;it’s ironic that pro lifers are the ones who uphold their individual choices.  That is why they don't resent their pregnancies: it's their choice to keep. Giving up my body is indeed self sacrificial.  &gt;That’s not being saintly, it’s being decent.  Do you expect a young girl to keep it too? It doesn't matter if she wanted to sleep with a boy of her age, or was raped. Her body is too young to carry.

You assumed I'm the sort who hates condoms, or is lazy to get pills. This is what pro life assumes of most women in an abortion clinic: they didn't use protection, that's why they're there right? No. Many of them do use contraception, they are just unlucky to be pregnant.  Like I said before, ""Contraception is a clear desire not to have kids (or at least not at the wrong time).""  I know I said, ""A woman can like dick in her vagina. She may even like ejaculate. But that doesn't mean she wants to be pregnant. It's called taking the third option."" But why use women like her to deny other women an out? Pro life suggests blanket solutions, and one-size-fits-all of banning abortion is an ill fitting suggestion.  &gt;You realize even an infant is tethered to the mother, so I don’t understand why you draw the line at birth.  A zygote is not the same as a baby. A newborn can be passed to another person while still being alive. A fetus needs to be connected to me to stay alive, and imposes on my body 24/7.  &gt;Self sacrifice is when you don’t choose it, but the situation appears, you CHOSE this.  This still counts as pro choice, because the woman chose to keep her pregnancy instead of abortion. Being forced would mean she wants sex but don't want pregnancy, and is denied an out through a safe abortion. Being forced also might mean she has an abusive partner or family who force her from going to the clinic."

On top on how deadly and demanding pregnancy could be, they were treated badly and the resulting babies were sold to couples.  Increasing standard of healthcare is no excuse to deny women an out for pregnancy. By denying safe abortion, you will only get more maternal deaths, deaths from diy abortions, and an increase in unwanted children at the mercy of a broken system.  &gt;Unfortunately, there are not enough *pro-lifers* to rescue every kid in the foster system.

Just like conservative parents who claim that teaching about sex and protection condones premarital sex, while in reality it protects more people than abstinence would.  In the same way, allowing abortion doesn't mean you have to like it, but recognise that various women and reasons can't be solved with a blanket ban.  You keep saying the fetus is denied a life.

You tell me a fetus is an incremental stage like a child, teenager or adult. You tell me you don't need brains for life. Guess what? Life begins at conception is a religious sentimentality. It barely has any functions yet, and the body is so strict, this gets flushed out naturally. That is why hating first trimester abortion is bizarre.  If I am knocked up or raped while in school and wish to attend class without morning sickness and other more serious stuff, I would abort. **Even if I wanted the baby, the end result is the same: the fetus imposes on my body and affects my health.** I don't care how petty I come across to you: it's my education and future.

But I don't want to be pregnant.""  They replied, ""If you like unprotected sex you have to understand that you may become pregnant"" and it's immoral to abort any pregnancy that results.

VampireStereotype,2020-06-13 16:03:18,fupnhfn,t3_h8a1fc,t3_h8a1fc,"While most forced-birthers certainly do think that women are... ""incompetent and mentally ill dumbasses incapable of making their own decisions"" (eloquently put) I think we all can see this as a lie intended to make forced-birth seem more palatable to outsiders.  If forced-birthers were given their way, women who seek abortions would be punished harshly. They say as much when they think outsiders are not listening."
sselinsea,2020-06-13 16:09:33,fupo5kk,t3_h0dzh7,t1_fuplrr0,"&gt;The problem is: you think it imposes on you “without your consent”, but you were the one that failed to use protection, you were the one that went out and had unsafe sex.  Don't assume that pro choice does not understand cause and effect. I can dislike a natural consequence and do anything to keep it away. Who knows? The woman who likes jizz may have a partner who got himself snipped.  &gt;If you invite someone to a party and they stay the length of the party, that’s not imposing on you, that’s a completely normal result of your actions.  Pro life likes to say I *consciously* invite someone to my house only to kill him. But pregnancy is not a conscious decision, it happens whether I consciously wanted to be pregnant or not. It would be ideal if a pregnancy would only occur if both partners consciously want it, but we don't live in an ideal world. Sex and pregnancy is personal, and so is abortion.  Anyway, I don't agree that a foetus takes precedent over the woman no matter what, even if she hates condoms or forgets the pill. I won't wish the effects of pregnancy on my worst enemy.  &gt; A) The unborn develop in incremental stages the same way the born do, dosent mean a teenager is less human than an adult.  The issue here is a foetus squashing my organs and compromising my health. That is why we don't kill newborns, toddlers, children, *teenagers, and adults*: they don't need to compromise my body to survive. Even a newborn has all of its parts: most abortions are done first trimester where they don't have a brain to comprehend, and pain receptors to feel.  *But most importantly, it is easier to remove before it develops further, gives the woman nasty pregnancy symptoms and harder to remove.*  Heck, your problem isn't fetus death, because the body does flush zygotes and fetuses out. You care about the woman raising her hand against the course of nature.  &gt; Buddy, calling the fact that life begins at conception a ‘religious sentiment’ does not disprove the other things I told you, it’s just a last-resort accusation that has no actual meaning.  If life begins at conception, why aren't you mad about the zygotes that get flushed out of the body? There is a reason why trying for a baby isn't easy! Again, it's not about death: it's about what the woman does that you have a problem with.  I repeat: it having human rights doesn't mean I am obligated to be its donor 24/7. Bodily autonomy is a *personal matter.* It would be better if every child is a wanted child, but not every parent can grant that."

Controlling a woman's body, sexuality and life is a byproduct of pro life beliefs whether you believe in controlling women or not.  I haven't met one who doesn't want all or any of the following: to throw abortion doctors in jail, women in jail, women for ""counselling"" (telling her why she's ""wrong""), and the most egregious of all: shutting down save avenues for abortions.  **Who are you to tell her you know more about her, than herself?**  &gt;abortion is unnatural, unnecessary and artificially alters human life.  &gt;Abortion is unnatural, miscarriage is not.  Don't use nature to your own benefit when there is also syphilis. Access to contraception and abortion is unnatural, yet increases women's quality of life*. Life isn't just about popping out babies anymore: in developed, stable nations, women can choose when they want to have kids (or even if they want to have kids) to pursue education and greater career opportunities.  *Don't tell me hospitals giving maternal care increases my quality of life. You can pay off my hospital bills and the kid's expenses until they're an adult. It won't change the fact I don't want pregnancy and its negative effects.  &gt;Why do you think so many women are pro life.  Some feel love and connection to their fetus. Some are driven by religion. Some may think others should not abort because she can't have children of her own. It doesn't matter, as not even another woman is entitled to my body.  You think every pregnancy should happen like a wanted pregnancy? You think it's a woman's duty to carry any resulting pregnancy? **Dream on. Some women will never want one even if you made the world perfect for women.**"

There are a lot of self-styled ""feminist"" forced birthers who *say* they want to make the world so equal for women that no  women would ever consider aborting, because having a baby wouldn't ever be a burden on the woman. My responses are that:  1. They betray themselves in never actively fighting in a visible way to enact that world first; you don't see forced-birth ""feminists"" out in front to push better protections for workplace discrimination against moms and pregnant people, free childcare for all, free healthcare for all, stronger child support laws etc. etc. / whatever they support other than abortion. You'd think if they really cared about women they'd want to make the world perfect first, so no woman ever felt forced to abort. 2. They erase women like me who would never ever agree to carry a pregnancy to term even if conditions were perfect. I'm still the kind of woman a forced-birth ""feminist"" would strap to a table and force to give birth, because that's the only way I'd ever do it."

Once you're born, do you lose your ""innocence"" and suddenly don't matter anymore?  I have long suspected that the more ""innocent"" someone is perceived to be, the more forced birthers value them and it doesn't take a lot of loss of ""innocence"" for them to feel like a human being is used tissue paper, fit to be thrown in the trash. That's how they feel about women who have sex, for example.  The  only people ""Innocent"" enough to matter to forced birthers are those in the womb."
jrw2868,2020-06-13 19:02:49,fuq7mw4,t3_h7zsxr,t1_fuobvyr,"Right. If they really cared about fetuses, they'd be picketing outside fertility clinics. A lot of forced birthers will claim they don't like IVF clinics, but the truth is that they destroy far more embryos than the typical abortion clinic and you don't ever see forced birthers getting worked up about it or forced birth lawmakers trying to legislate it.  I think it was Clyde Chambliss who said “The egg in the lab doesn’t apply. It’s not in a woman. She’s not pregnant.” Absolutely couldn't be clearer."

They aren’t going to get to kill the number of women they want to kill. Menstrual extraction came about shortly before Roe and was used by feminist groups to give an unknown number of women safe illegal abortions. Groups like the Jane collective performed thousands of safe illegal D&amp;C abortions shortly before Roe and never lost a patient. And today ingesting a set of pills is enough to perform a safe illegal abortion. Additionally, today we have the internet and social media and a vast collection of books that tell women how to acquire abortion pills and set up a device with simple and easily bought items that can be used by feminist groups to give women a menstrual extraction or vacuum aspiration abortion. While anti-choicers will succeed in killing and maiming some women if abortion is made illegal, thankfully this isn’t 1972 and there are would be a variety of safe but illegal options.  Abortion care has come a long way in the last half century."

For how much they wish to eredicate the woman from the discourse, it simply can't be. There's a breathing, living sentient and intelligent person there who needs to carry the fetus, a murdered person wasn't in the killer body to start with, you can't simply choose to overlook it  2. They treat the fetus as the sentient and living being and wish it had the same rights as people already born, and treat the woman as its house. They accuse us of ""de humanizing"" the fetus but that's it, the fetus has the potential to be human but its not human yet. They attach complex emotions and abilities to the fetus like: ""I can't breathe"", ""it wanted or choosed to live"" ""It didn't want to be murdered"" etc.. the fetus has none of this ability. It doesn't secretly or magically thanks the pro life whenever they manage to persuade a pregnant person to carry the pregnancy, it doesn't think, breathe, feel until a certain stage.   3. In order for most of the pro life stances to make sense and abortion to be murder, fetus should develop inside a tiny baloons without influencing other people bodies. You can't otherwise when it takes another person body in order to make the fetus survive. You can't.take.the woman choice and decision.away. period. And also why their ridiculous ""it's not your body so it's not your choice"" in favor of the fetus is simply plain laughable and delusional"
k710see,2020-06-17 10:06:38,fv3x311,t3_hajdbm,t3_hajdbm,"Take a deep breathe, love. As someone who also lives in the US, I understand your fear. But remember that regardless of what the law says and what anti-choicers want, we own our bodies. That isn’t up for debate. We are in control of our bodies and that includes deciding when we want to become pregnant and if we want to stay pregnant.   It is very unlikely that abortion will be outlawed throughout the country. Even if Roe v. Wade were to be overturned, the legal status of abortion would vary from state to state. In more liberal states such as California and New York, abortion would remain legal. In more conservative states, however, it’s more likely that abortion will be made illegal. If you live in a red state, I would highly suggest saving up money in case you ever need an abortion and your only option is to travel out of state. If you’re able to, save up to where you’d be able to spontaneously leave the country to obtain an abortion elsewhere such as Canada.   Currently, there are numerous organizations that collect donations to aid women in need of abortions by helping pay for their gas, hotel room, daycare for other children, as well as the actual procedure (National Network of Abortion Funds). If Roe v. Wade were to be overturned, there would without a doubt be an increase in donations because people know that women will seek an abortion regardless of whether or not it’s legal. The majority prefer women do it safely. There are also a few reliable sites online that can discreetly mail you abortion pills. If you’re worried about abortion being outlawed, you can stock up on some now in case you, or anyone else you know, need them in the future.   Your body, your uterus, is yours. Always has, always will be. It’s okay to be afraid, but know there are steps that you can take to preserve your bodily autonomy in the instance that abortion rights are stripped. Just because abortion may be come illegal in some states doesn’t mean you can’t still safely have one. It’ll be harder, but still possible and there’s thousands of people that will actively support women if that time ever comes. You don’t need the law to tell you what you can and can’t do with your body."

They don't put ""We provide abortion services"" on their websites- instead, they'll have a tab or page with ""Information about Abortion"" that is full of neutral descriptions of procedures, without ever actually saying that they perform said procedures.  So you call and say ""Hello, do you do abortions?"" and instead of saying yes or no, they'll tell you ""Just make an appointment and come in and we can go over all of that with you.""  Their dream target is, [in their own words](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/a38642/heartbeat-international-conference-crisis-pregnancy-centers-abortion/), is a woman who is seeking an abortion, so they do everything they can to obfuscate the fact that this isn't something said women can obtain at their organization.  I'm honestly not sure if they'd be liable to a lawsuit or other form of complaint for actually lying and that's what's keeping them from straight-up saying ""Yes, we do abortions here, come on by!"", but it's my understanding that they don't typically do that.  They'll just use every trick in the book to make you *assume* that they do abortions, and never correct your assumption until they've got you in the room."

If they weren't as poor, or weren't as at risk (2-6x more likely to die than white people), maybe there wouldn't be as many Abortions. If healthcare in the US was universal, if contraception was free, if extended paid maternity leave was provided with legal job protections, if childcare was cheaper or free, maybe the number of abortions for POC would reduce (as would abortions in general), and if sex ed was comprehensive and **mandatory** for all from age 5. I'm of the opinion that parents shouldn't have the option of withdrawing their child from sex ed. I consider it part of their science education, and i strongly believe that children are *entitled* to accurate information about their bodies and reproductive health. I don't think a child should end up as a teenager who was simply told to ""abstain"", or who wasn't told about contraception, fertility (such as how to track your period/ovulation), consent and boundaries, or sex in general. I think it's a huge disservice and part of the reason why teen pregnancy is so high in a lot of US states."

I covertly attended a ""pro-life training"" seminar once, and while it was mostly as expected, it was extremely interesting to me when a younger girl asked the presenter why we were so focused on arguing about abortion, because shouldn't we just be working to convert people instead, since that would take care of making them pro-life?  (Obviously, she seemed unaware that there are pro-choice Christians).  And I do think that conversion is one of the secret (or not-so-secret) goals of CPC's as well; [this quote](https://cand86.tumblr.com/post/182556475277/these-pregnancy-center-workers-and-im) from Meaghan Winter (the author of that linked article) is very illuminating to me:  &gt;*These pregnancy center workers- and I’m generalizing here- but a lot of them tend to be Evangelicals, and they really believe that there’s one way to live, and it’s according to a literal interpretation of the Bible, as I’m sure many of your listeners are aware.  But I really didn’t understand the extent to which many of these women really do believe that abortion harms women, and not only abortion, but an entire what I’ll call ‘lifestyle’, which includes premarital sex, not attending church, not accepting Jesus as a personal Lord and savior; all of these things are bound up together for many of these pregnancy center workers. So it’s not really even about abortion for many of them, abortion is just one part of a much bigger worldview and a much bigger kind of life’s work, to basically liberate suffering people from a life of sin or a life of emptiness or loneliness or however it’s described or however those particular women feel about it.  So within that kind of larger context, many of these women, these pregnancy center workers, believe that women who arrive at their centers are suffering, and not just because they’re pregnant, but because they’re part of this whole sinful life, they’re not living in accordance to the Bible, as these pregnancy center workers believe we all should.  So in light of that, many of them believe it’s their duty or the kindest thing they can do, to persuade women not only to not have abortions, but to stop having sex, to become faithful followers of Jesus, and that will kind of release them from whatever suffering they’re carrying around with them, and of course we all suffer, so it’s an argument they think applies to pretty much everybody.  These pregnancy center workers- and again I’m generalizing- but from what I’ve heard from them, they really believe they’re doing a good thing.  They really believe that abortion hurts women, and they really believe that this is what they need to do, not only to save what they call unborn children, but to save women and to convert them … When reproductive rights advocates dismiss the beliefs that these pregnancy center workers hold, I think they miss an opportunity to criticize the centers, in fact, because so much of what they’re doing is related to conversion, and that raises a lot of questions in terms of their government funding … The more we kind of look into their underlying goals, the more questions we can ask about what’s happening in terms of the overlap between public policy, public health, and their mission.*"
JJsGirl83,2020-07-12 21:01:04,fxv5kxz,t3_hq1wmy,t3_hq1wmy,Personally I am pro choice for women regardless of how far along she is in the pregnancy and whether she is keeping the baby or not.
Snoo_25435,2020-07-12 21:11:24,fxv6png,t3_hq1wmy,t1_fxv5kxz,"So you believe a woman has the right to subject her child to a life of severe disability and suffering? Because that's exactly what happens with fetal alcohol syndrome. FAS kids/adults often have extreme difficulty in school, work, and relationships because they cannot connect actions with consequences. Plus they tend to have lots of physical health problems as well."
VampireStereotype,2020-07-12 21:19:33,fxv7llr,t3_hq1wmy,t3_hq1wmy,"Yes I would say it is.  I don't, however, think that it has much relevancy to the ethics of abortion. Nor do I think that we can or should make laws about such things or punish those who do such things.  Before we go any further...  Breathing polluted air causes birth defects and affects the future health of in-utero children. Do you feel, therefore, that it's immoral to live in a city while pregnant? Or that it's immoral to become pregnant while living in a city?  You don't actually have to answer that, but I suggest that it would be difficult for someone to explain why drinking while pregnant is immoral while living in a city while pregnant is not.  ""My body, my choice"" explicitly *does* apply to everything a pregnant person does with their body - including smoking.  However, we can accept that some actions would seem to be needlessly more cruel than others.  *Nobody in the history of the world has ever had an abortion just for the sake of having an abortion*.  People seek abortion because they do not (or no longer) wish to be pregnant. Abortion is not the end, it's the means. That makes it qualitatively different to, for example, drinking. Even where it is an addiction, drinking is not a means to an end, but the end itself.  Even if one chooses to cognise abortion as cruel I suggest that it is not *needlessly* cruel. Whereas I suggest drinking while pregnant is *needlessly* cruel. It is sacrificing the future wellbeing of another person just for the sake of one's own pleasure.  Compare my above point about city air.  Living in a city while pregnant certainly is compromising the wellbeing of your future child - but is it *needless*? Few people have the luxury of being able to just go live somewhere else on a whim. Almost everyone, even most addicts, do have the 'luxury' of abstaining from drink for nine months.  Compare that, to the extent that we can, to abortion.  Going without a drink for nine months does not compromise one's health (quite the reverse, in fact), does not risk one's life. Does not requite one to sacrifice their body do another's use.  Moreover, denying a person a drink does not compromise their bodily autonomy, but denying a person an abortion does.  For that reason alone, I really cannot see the two questions as being comparable at all."
cand86,2020-07-12 21:23:51,fxv82hg,t3_hq1wmy,t3_hq1wmy,"I personally feel that you are liable for the harms that you incur on someone, even if said harms occurred in utero, so if you end up birthing someone who suffers from fetal alcohol syndrome due to your actions, it's wrong, inasmuch as we agree that FAS and other issues caused during pregnancy by the mother's actions are detrimental to someone's life and well-being.  That said, I also believe that in many cases, pregnant women are struggling with addiction, and they want the best for their children, even while they slip up and make mistakes.  I believe a certain level of compassion is needed- women who are addicted to drugs and alcohol are more likely to neglect prenatal care, for example, if they are condemned rather than offered help, or if they fear being jailed or judged for poor birth outcomes.  I think it's very . . . telling . . . that we only treat certain activities dangerous to fetuses as bad, while others are good.  I've posted this before, from Lynn Paltrow, in Jennifer Block's book [*Pushed: The Painful Truth About Childbirth and Modern Maternity Care*](https://www.amazon.com/Pushed-Painful-Childbirth-Modern-Maternity-ebook/dp/B00A4JNG3K):  &gt;*""She also maintains that they must be seen in the context of a culture that celebrates the woman who conceives quadruplets after multiple fertility treatments- treatments that put the fetuses at risk for severe prematurity, neurological damage, and death- yet imprisons the woman who puts her fetus at far less risk with illegal drug use.*  And finally, I think it should be noted that there's so much different advice from medical authorities regarding drinking- whether a beer or glass of wine a week or a month is fine or still cause for concern- that I don't think that we ought be practicing judgment just because we see someone who we know is pregnant or a stranger who is visibly so consuming alcohol."
VampireStereotype,2020-07-12 21:33:48,fxv950g,t3_hq1wmy,t1_fxv82hg,"&gt; I personally feel that you are liable for the harms that you incur on someone, even if said harms occurred in utero, so if you end up birthing someone who suffers from fetal alcohol syndrome due to your actions, it's wrong, inasmuch as we agree that FAS and other issues caused during pregnancy by the mother's actions are detrimental to someone's life and well-being.  I don't think that's a particularly controvercial idea.  We are all responsible for the things we choose to do affecting others. We all have a moral duty to do least harm, to the best of our ability, including our ability to determine what is best.  But the thing is... do you personally think you have the right to tell another person what she may or may not do with her body?  Because I certainly do not think I have that right.  I think someone who chooses to drink while pregnant is making an immoral choice - a choice which I would try to dissuade. But I think that if I chose to try to stop her - to deny her that choice - I would be making a considerably *more* immoral choice.  A person who does not own her own body - who lacks the right to bodily autonomy and to self-ownership cannot be said to have any rights at all.  And frankly, my conception of myself as a remotely moral person could not allow me to deny another person that most basic of all rights, even where I think they may be misusing it.  I don't want to live in a world where other people can choose what I may or may not do with my body."
ITriedSoHard419-68,2020-07-12 21:35:09,fxv9adp,t3_hq1wmy,t3_hq1wmy,"Yes, it is.  I'm going to use my usual analogy for abortion, and then I'll expand on it to get into why.  Parenthood is a choice. It's always a choice. You can always relinquish that responsibility. When a child is born, you relinquish by adopting out, and when the child has not been born relinquishing responsibility is called abortion. You can give up responsibility for a child at any time, but if you choose to keep that child you better take care of them. A woman can't choose to keep a child and start beating them; CPS is going to come and that child's going to be taken away and put in the adoption system anyway. Same thing with responsibility for the unborn. You can choose to keep or not keep, but if you choose to keep, you better take care of them."

Low sperm quality can cause miscarriages by genetic errors and it can lead to birth defects.

However, I don't own other people bodies, so the choices they make are theirs. I like to mind my own business."

We don’t say it’s wrong if a woman needs to take anti depressants and it causes harm to the baby.   The problem with calling it “wrong” is that it implies she needs punishment.   It’s harmful might be a better way to phrase it.   I would frown on a woman who does not take action to address her dependency though."

Snoo_25435,2020-07-13 02:10:39,fxw1buj,t3_hq1wmy,t1_fxvz7kg,"1. The risks are not even comparable. Inhaling a small amount of pollution is not the same as pickling your child.   2. A lot of people don't choose to live in a bad environment. They're usually poor or have other circumstances that would make it nearly impossible for them to get away from urban pollution. Drinking alcohol, on the other hand, is always a choice."
newibsaccount,2020-07-13 04:55:38,fxwftln,t3_hq1wmy,t3_hq1wmy,"The drinking is not wrong. She has no obligation to provide any kind of incubation service to the fetus, so it has no right to complain that the service it receives isn't good enough.  On the other hand, birthing a child that is going to suffer is wrong, but that's the case for every child born.  Abortion is always the morally superior choice."
defending_feminism,2020-07-13 06:51:57,fxwnwc1,t3_hq1wmy,t3_hq1wmy,"I think it's definitely a bad thing to do, that should be discouraged. That being said, I don't think people have the right to legally prevent a woman from doing it, for bodily autonomy reasons.      On the other hand, I think abortion is a moral act. That's because drinking while pregnant causes harm to a future person. Abortion simply prevents that person from ever coming into being (note I am using ""person"" in the philosophical sense, as a being with mental states and experiences. A ZEF doesn't have these.)     So while drinking while pregnant is a bad, if permissible, thing to do, abortion is a \*moral\* act. That is, there's no reason to discourage a woman from getting an abortion, while there's very good reason to discourage a woman from drinking while pregnant with a pregnancy she wishes to keep."

The way the fetus completely changes the brain chemistry of it's ""host"" turning them into their personal ""slaves"" is some Sci fi shit. 😬😬😬  It should Always be voluntary imo."
sselinsea,2020-07-13 15:00:39,fxxnq8a,t3_hqecya,t1_fxxnizc,"Then why do surrogates feel attachment to a fetus in her body? Even though she knows someone else is borrowing her womb for their genetic material (not hers)?  There is a story somewhere in this sub on how a woman felt the hormones and felt that she could carry the pregnancy, but aborted it anyway."

However, it's still their choice whether or not to give in to those cravings. If it wasn't their choice, then no one would ever be able to overcome addiction. So clearly choices play a role."
Snoo_25435,2020-07-13 15:21:38,fxxq4rj,t3_hq1wmy,t1_fxwftln,"&gt;it has no right to complain that the service it receives isn't good enough  You act like a woman is always doing the ZEF a favor by bringing it into the world—but that's not necessarily true. If a woman chooses not to birth a child, the ""child"" is unaffected because it doesn't exist yet. Abortion is a morally neutral choice.   Once you decide to bring a child into the world (carry to term), all other parenting choices *do* involve morality. If a woman chooses to damage a fetus and let it become a person anyway, that's no different than a parent abusing their child after it's born.   Also, it's not just about the fetus—it's about the burden to society. If a woman brings a severely brain-damaged child into the world, someone will have to take care of him/her, possibly for the rest of that child's life. Is that fair to anyone? I don't think so."

lewd-spagghetti,2020-07-13 16:10:48,fxxvzc1,t3_hqel33,t3_hqel33,"This was an incredible read and I absolutely agree. When I first delved deep into the abortion debate and debunkings from both sides and stuff like that, pro-lifers had WAY more resources, apologetics, trainings for how to answer prochoice questions, funds to help new mothers, etc. Not to mention their catchy slogans that stomp the average prochoicer (i.e. prochoicer: keep abortion safe!” pl: abortion can never be safe because it always kills a human being). Or, prochoicer: “my body my choice!” prolifer: “except the fetus is not your body, as it’s a unique independent human being from the mother”.  Of course I’m out of that mindset now but I know in my soul that pro-lifers as a whole are winning in the US because they’re willing to pinpoint ways to manipulate the public’s emotions. All planned parenthood and NARAL seem to do is repeat the same jargon of mY bOdY mY ChOiCe. Even during the 2019 abortion bans they seemed so inactive and barely encouraging the public to get involved and fight back. And as we all know, wins for the pro-life movement are catastrophic for women’s lives, health, wellbeing, etc."
Snoo_25435,2020-07-13 16:53:32,fxy18rp,t3_hqecya,t3_hqecya,"I agree with you, there is a chemical basis for parents bonding with their children, even in utero. A pregnant woman cannot interact with her embryo/fetus in any meaningful way. For most of the pregnancy, the ZEF is not even conscious (as far as we know). Therefore, the bonding that people experience with their unborn child must be based on something other than a reciprocal relationship.   But really, it doesn't matter whether the bond is based on chemistry or something else. What matters is that not everyone experience that bond, and no one should be demonized for their feelings. Not everyone wants to be a parent, and not all parents bond with their children right away. Pro-lifers act like pregnancy, birth, and child-rearing are magical and wonderful when in reality they are complex biological processes that affect everybody differently. In my experience, pro-lifers tend to get emotionally attached to things very easily, and they tend to demonize others who don't make every decision based on fuzzy feelings."
