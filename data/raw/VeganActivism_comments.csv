curiouspika,2019-11-04 16:01:55,f6irq2f,t3_drixar,t1_f6ipul4,The poster pictured doesn't mention animals. Are you saying it isn't advocating for veganism?
Duke_Nukem_1990,2019-11-04 16:04:22,f6is1iy,t3_drixar,t1_f6irq2f,I was referencing your title.  Veganism is not about food or health or the environment.  It's about stopping the exploitation of sentient beings.
outsidersXX,2019-11-04 16:04:22,f6is1kn,t3_drixar,t1_f6ipul4,It is literally 100 percent about the animals. The rest is the positive after effects.....  I'll back any movement to make vegans not seem so socially deconstructed. But I will never back that its ok to not focus on the animals..
curiouspika,2019-11-04 16:09:11,f6isol6,t3_drixar,t1_f6is1iy,"My title is in direct reference to the picture, which makes no mention of animals, yet very effectively advocates for veganism.  The point is that if some people are more concerned about water or the environment, then it's okay to use that angle to plant seeds about veganism.  Honestly, I'm a vegan for the animals first and always, but in-fighting and bickering does no good for our cause. We're all on the same team."
outsidersXX,2019-11-04 16:17:08,f6itqp1,t3_drixar,t1_f6isol6,True. Vegan = Ethics
BrokenDawn,2019-11-04 16:37:11,f6iwfjy,t3_drixar,t1_f6is1iy,I think they were saying you can use other incentives for plant based diets (there are many) to encourage people to consider veganism. It‚Äôs like trying to get someone to use plastic. You can say plastic is bad for the environment and doesn‚Äôt biodegrade and kills animals. OR you can say using reusable things are cheaper and cost less in total. It‚Äôs not really the point but it still pushes the message
vegancandle,2019-11-04 16:45:38,f6ixkfm,t3_drixar,t1_f6is1kn,If you can get them attracted through other means then it might lead them onto concern for animals. Some people will be put off by focusing on animals initially. There are people who have gone vegan for environmental or health reasons and moved on to concern for animals following this. Once they are into it they might be more open to exploring other reasons for being vegan.
outsidersXX,2019-11-04 17:53:51,f6j6ri9,t3_drixar,t1_f6ixkfm,I cant argue that. üëç
exoticcatpoopcoffee,2019-11-04 17:56:36,f6j74vi,t3_drixar,t1_f6ixkfm,It's true.  That's how it happened for me.
Tundur,2019-11-04 19:16:21,f6jhxfc,t3_drixar,t1_f6is1kn,"It's a rhetorical tactic. Everyone who isn't an idiot is currently thinking ""ah gee I need to be more eco-friendly"", to various extents. It's seen as society's flaw that we're all working on together and even middle aged white men who look like gammon have reusable coffee cups now.  Meanwhile meat is perceived as a personal flaw, so people take it as a personal attack.  This is just a much less confrontational approach, and a plant-based diet helps animals even if the person didn't intend for that to be the case"
outsidersXX,2019-11-04 19:18:36,f6ji8ot,t3_drixar,t1_f6jhxfc,I agree completely. Thank you.
outsidersXX,2019-11-04 19:23:22,f6jivz3,t3_drixar,t1_f6jhxfc,"Do you think thats why we get labeled as having an ""agenda""? Because they take it as a personal attack? Ive never understood how something so peaceful and non disruptive could have a negative ""agenda"".."
Smushsmush,2019-11-04 20:38:00,f6jt9lz,t3_drixar,t1_f6ixkfm,"Yup for me it was a slippery slope from reducing meat for eco reasons, to cutting it out since I didn't want it anymore to realising I don't want to harm any animals ever. Took a few years thought ¬∞_¬∞  So now when I do outreach with AV I always go for ethics since there is no reductionism possible :)"

notin10000years,2019-11-05 02:35:40,f6kuxwr,t3_drixar,t1_f6isol6,"For someone who went plant based for the environment, what stops them from using cosmetics tested on animals, leather, other forms of animal exploitation other than factory farming?  Are they vegan if they think the use of animals for those reasons is justified?  I‚Äôm not saying it isn‚Äôt effective, and people eating less animal products is great no matter why that is. But it‚Äôs not advocating veganism. That‚Äôs what the guy above was talking about"
iwnguom,2019-11-05 11:44:26,f6lnghi,t3_drixar,t1_f6ipul4,"You might not be directly advocating veganism but you are making it easier to advocate for veganism by making it easier for people to really hear and take on board the arguments.  I originally aimed to go plant based in order to reduce my environmental impact. Once I was already massively reducing my animal product consumption, it was so much easier for me to contemplate the ethical arguments for veganism because I didn‚Äôt feel like I had to defend my own actions, I was already most of the way there, and I had removed that need for the cognitive dissonance of having to believe one thing but do another.  Personally I think people who are plant based for environmental reasons are the tiniest little hop away from veganism. Plus, it IS important to reduce our environmental impact so it‚Äôs not a bad thing either way.  Not only that but in the end, surely from our perspective the aim is to end animal suffering. At the end of the day it doesn‚Äôt matter if people are cutting out animal products for the animals, for the environment, or because a cow told them to in a dream - ultimately, the result is the same."
iwnguom,2019-11-05 11:47:28,f6lnltj,t3_drixar,t1_f6is1kn,"For me, I was already on my way to being plant based for the environment - that made it so much easier for me to accept the ethical arguments as well.  If people are already on board with the lifestyle changes, one of the obstacles to veganism (the cognitive dissonance between a person‚Äôs learned actions and adopting new beliefs) is removed. Removing obstacles to veganism IS a form of vegan advocacy."

letzgo1,2019-12-21 11:39:40,fbj9nz1,t3_edolin,t3_edolin,"Living by example only goes so far. You‚Äôve just got to be upfront with her that her actions are unnecessarily harming animals.. (show her vids of animal cruelty, explain what happens to animals etc.)  The strongest indicator why someone goes and stays Vegan is if they go Vegan for the animals, not because they feel great in regards to their health.   Also if all people see is the benefit they get out of being Vegan (for health for example) there is no incentive to stop them if they feel like having ‚Äúa cheat day‚Äù.   The focal point of your advocacy should be morality, not health. Veganism is about non-violence to animals not your health."

stopclimatechange-,2019-12-21 14:10:10,fbjomar,t3_edolin,t3_edolin,"Hey. Things like that is tough, especially when it‚Äôs friends or other close ppl. But my advice is to listen to the socialpsychologist and vegan activist Melanie Joy. She has reasearched ‚Äùthe psychology behind eating meat (and other animal products)‚Äù for 20 years. Listen to her speaches about vegan advocacy!   She says things like: the important thing is not WHAT you say (the facts etc), but HOW you say things. Bc ppl will remember more strongly how you made them feel, rather than the words you said. And that you should share your own story of going vegan. Walk them trough it, lead them, trough your eyes (your story). And that it‚Äôs important to not make someone feel judged or attacked. That you wanna direct their anger towards the lies they‚Äôve been told, instead of directing the anger towards themselves. Also: People will go vegan when they‚Äôre ready, no matter how much facts they know etc. If they‚Äôre not ready, they won‚Äôt make the change. And that‚Äôs prob how it‚Äôs like with your friend.   Maybe find a way to gently get to know why she‚Äôs not ready. Or just tell things that held you back (if you had any). For me: I would share the story of me going vegan. Telling her it was a long process, where I was vegetarian but ate mostly vegan for 3 years. Telling her I knew about all things in the animal industry those 3 years and that I wanted to go vegan, but that social fear held me back. Then I would tell her the point of no return, where I told myself to fuck my fears and just do it. And that it was the best decision ever and so much easier than I thought.  You can also look at models of behaviour change. Like the transtheoretical one."

UnexpectedWilde,2019-12-21 16:31:56,fbk7e6b,t3_edolin,t1_fbjcbzy,"I agree with @Vaegeli, I was the same way. If anything, make a point of legitimately not caring whether or not she goes vegan. Even if she tests you by telling you she's thinking about it or saying ""I may go vegan one day a week,"" ""I'm going to give going vegan a try,"" etc., don't show any excitement. If she ASKS for advice, give some, but generally be disinterested. If she's ever likely to come around, this will maximize the chance."

Though the sample is small, the consensus seems to be that, to be effective messengers, we should avoid aggressive, guilt-inducing tactics that do nothing but reinforce stereotypes and inspire defensiveness. Instead, we should be respectful, encourage small steps, and lead by example.   There is some good advice in this article. I get frustrated when some vegans argue that we shouldn't encourage small steps or ""transitioning"" to a vegan lifestyle. If your goal is to instantly convert everyone you interact with about veganism to an overnight 100% vegan you're not being realistic.   &gt; 37.5% of vegans ""transitioned over a period of time"" according to a 2019 survey of almost 13,000 vegans in 97 countries.

Supermarkets, restaurants, and even fast food outlets have developed numerous high quality and affordable vegan options.

If we are to reduce animal product consumption in the UK and around the world, the development of high quality affordable alternatives to animal products is key.‚Äù"

Emergency-Chocolate,2020-01-14 02:26:03,fec8zjk,t3_eoaw7i,t1_fec4hr9,"The thing is that a lot of people don't have the time. Half an hour a day (10 minutes a meal) doesn't seem like a lot to you but 3.5 hours a week is a huge amount of time to a lot of people. Thats an extra 14 hours a month they could be spending at work, or with their kids, or working another job, ect.  In many cases how convenient something is can be a huge barrier to entry- make it convenient, easy, and cheap for the lower level consumers and the higher level ones will eventually follow.  Knowing the barriers to entry and working to lower them is the best way to solve the problem- not, you know, railing against the millions of people who are struggling to stay afloat and who have too much on their plate to even think about adding more it and helping alienate them as a result."
Emergency-Chocolate,2020-01-14 02:42:49,fecat12,t3_eoaw7i,t3_eoaw7i,"So now the best way to handle this is to convince them being vegan is easier (less expensive and more convenient) and better tasting.   I'd imagine that the best way to do so would be to focus on the bottom and work our way up- start with helping low income workers make the transition (teach them that they could save $X by cutting out animal products and still get the taste, teach them recipes that are fast, super cheap,easy, and keep well, ect) and slowly work our way up.  If lower income people start going vegan to save money and time that negates two huge barriers of entry for people who are middle class and up, making it easier to get them to go vegan.  &amp;#x200B;  \[And while obviously not every low income person is going to go vegan, especially since its easy to say you can save money when you can buy in bulk, every little bit helps\]"
Emergency-Chocolate,2020-01-14 04:02:15,feci7wg,t3_eoaw7i,t1_feceqj0,"True. I apologize- I should have taken more time to consider my wording earlier. I agree with you 100%.  The root causes of things people consider barriers- ""veganism is a sacrifice in taste"" likely arose because many people aren't vegan by choice so being vegan is a sacrifice they make because they can't afford animal products and ""veganism is expensive"" likely arose because the fact that only people who can afford to be it by choice are people who aren't poor gets combined with the fact that things like beyond burgers are super expensive- are mostly artificial.  Reframing things that people likely consider a negative will help remove the barrier to entry.  Right now the fight to spread veganism is just a massive PR campaign. I see a lot of people attacking nonvegans online and I can't help but feel its counter productive and actively hurting the cause in the long run.  Right now just about everyone knows going vegan is better for the enviroment so instead of alienating potential vegans like so many in the comunity seem determined to do we need to focus on teaching them that doing so isn't going to be the huge sacrifice they think it is- teach them fast, easy, cheap, and tasty recipes (many of which they already cook) and that will be a huge help to get the ball rolling."

Saying ""It just takes 10 minutes per meal"" doesn't help, saying ""It usually takes the same amount of time (or less) to cook vegan food than it does to cook nonvegan food"" does.   All acting like they're selfish/morons/horrible (even online) does is start an adversarial relationship between them and veganism. At this point getting people to go vegan is a PR/marketing issue."

Tobias Leenaert argues that meat reducers make it easier for people to go vegan because they increase demand for vegan products, leading to an increase in availability of vegan products.   He compares this with gluten-free. Over the last 10 years or so, there has been a large number of people seeking to reduce their consumption of gluten-free products who aren't actually allergic. This in turn, has massively increased the availability of gluten-free products, which is extremely beneficial for people with gluten allergies.

Point out that not owning, raping, mutilating slaves - because slavery is devastating to the economy, is just as good of a reason as any. * Think about how you would feel if you owned human beings for profit * Be nice, be careful not to make people feel guilty for the whippings, rapes, and stealing of others lives. Have a sense of humor. * The point isn't to make people understand why what their doing is wrong. The point is to get slave masters to like you enough to maybe start to listen to you. * Don't be the abolition police. Accept that some people make a lot of money off of the captivity of others. Not everyone is going to care about their victims. * Make people think about how much better the quality of their cotton would be if the slaves got something out of the arrangement, and were more motivated. * Be patient, some peoples entire fortunes are built on the subjugation of others. 95% of people aren't on board with abolition yet. Our movement is young. Slavery is ancient. * Take care of your health. believe in people. Remember slave masters are humans too, just like their slaves. * Be modest, have you ever owned a slave or purchased the product of their subjugation? Remember we all have blind spots.  I'll tell you it's a good thing no feathers were ruffled over that whole slavery thing. Everyone was just super kind to the slave owners and it just sort of faded away.

I think that most of us in the animal rights community have been aware of the public health threat posed by animal agriculture and the wildlife trade since long before these issues were making headlines. As soon as the news broke that Covid-19 had originated in a wet market we asked the World Health Organization to call for the closure of live animal markets worldwide (including the ones here in the US). We started doing everything we could to make sure that the role animal agriculture played in this pandemic didn't get swept aside. And we called on the public to take personal responsibility by going vegan for the animals, and for the health and safety of our communities."

We have always been a pragmatic organization and continue to be, because moving animal rights forward is more important than philosophical purity. That said, if you look at our current campaigns they are firmly rooted in ending animal exploitation altogether, because there has been so much success in transforming the way the public sees animals, and the companies that wouldn't even acknowledge us a few decades ago know now that they cannot ignore PETA and other animal rights activists and groups."

ashlovesmongo,2020-05-27 21:47:42,fs0un87,t3_grr78d,t1_fs0ojy4,"Obviously we encourage people to avoid supporting industries that exploit animals, and the meat industry is one of the worst. We have a lot of resources on our website for people who want to feed their companion animals a vegan diet, but we also ask people to consult their veterinarians to be sure they are meeting the needs of their individual animals. And we are excited about companies like Wild Earth that are currently working on lab-grown meat options for cat and dog food."

We all need to be looking for every opportunity, big and small, to get the word out for animals, because it is making a difference. Public sentiment about how we should treat animals is shifting rapidly, and people are questioning the environmental and public health threats posed by the meat industry, so we just need to keep pushing every chance we get, and we need to be ready for every possible opportunity to make the connection for people.

As we all know, considering the impact we have on animals is not a convenient thing to think about. People will do just about anything to ignore thinking about how their behavior hurts animals. With our video game efforts, like many of PETA‚Äôs provocative and conversation-starting activities, we‚Äôve made it impossible for tens of millions of people to not stop and think ‚Äì even just for a moment ‚Äì about animal rights again and again. We consider this a win for animals.   We‚Äôve done this by embedding hard hitting videos in the games, by putting in snippets about how animals are abused, and more. We honestly can‚Äôt care less if at the same time many people mock us ‚Äì it‚Äôs not about PETA, it‚Äôs about planting the seeds of animal rights. That said, we don‚Äôt believe the people who tweet at us and say they are gonna eat a burger for every time PETA does X, Y, or Z.   The entire 13 years I‚Äôve worked at PETA I‚Äôve heard that so many things hurt PETA, but I‚Äôve only seen the organization and our impact grow. I believe whole-heartily in PETA‚Äôs strategy to get attention for animals in all the create ways we can, whether it‚Äôs through video games, asking for fish to be renamed Sea Kittens, or any of the other light-hearted things PETA does to get our message out in the public.   And we‚Äôre certainly not against video games ‚Äì there‚Äôs so much to love in Animal Crossing, for instance. We hope that knowing that PETA is watching nudges the companies in more animal-friendly messaging in games."

I think a mix of radical, uncomfortable honesty about the reality of what happens to animals, delivered with as much patience, kindness, and firmness as possible seems to get through to people. So at PETA that may mean a controversial demonstration, or a striking ad, or graphic undercover footage, but coupled with willingness on the part of activists to communicate calmly (NOT always easy, but so important), answer questions, and listen. I also think it is vital to give people an action step- you can't just present them with gruesome, heartbreaking images of animals being harmed, you need to tell them what they can do to fight it, because if people don't feel helpless they are less likely to just tune out."

I think spending years being part of the campaign to stop Ringling Brothers Circus from exploiting animals, and then watching their attendance drop until they finally shut down completely was one of the most meaningful victories for me. I spent a birthday right after I started working for PETA following one of the Ringling crews and filming them as they led a line of elephants from the train tracks in a city in Virginia to the arena, and a saw them up close, and the broken look in their eyes absolutely destroyed me. And I remember thinking ""this will end in my lifetime"", and then it DID, much faster than I expected, and it was proof that activism works, and that the world can change. As far as PETA's greatest achievement, that's much harder! There have been so many victories, from getting the first-ever prosecution and conviction of an animal experimenter on cruelty-to-animals charges back in the 80's to releasing the first-ever expos√© into the angora-wool rabbit industry that got more than 110 brands to drop angora-wool from their lines in the 2010's, PETA has had so many landmark victories that have had a ripple effect on how animals are thought of and treated. And I think that is really PETA's greatest achievement- the organization has played an instrumental role in shifting the way society thinks about animals and animal exploitation."

Thanks for doing this, by the way, I've had mixed feelings over the years, but overall am a fan of PETA and owe the organization a lot for all it's taught me (and yes, I am a member).  So first, I read PETA purchased enough shares in some major meat companies to be able to vote in shareholder meetings. I can see the rationale, but it also seems like a conflict of interest. Can you offer any insight into how that came about and what're some explicitly goals?  Second, PETA has a lot of different campaigns and messages from violent ages down to cutesy stickers saying stuff like ""I'm not a nugget."" I was wondering what kind of research goes into deciding when to use the violent/graphic/bold stuff vs. the sexy/celeb/veganism-is-cool vs. the cute stuff. I assume you probably have a decent sized marketing research team or...?

They feel you could be more effective by disassociating with such branding.  As a personal example, sometimes if I link PETA sources when having discussions with non-vegans they immediately refuse to read my citations or begin to argue the typical arguments against PETA (""Peta kills animals so the argument you're making is invalid""). This is often very frustrating so I end up referencing Mercy for Animals or other organizations.  It seems like PETA's controversies and controversial marketing is stained it enough that using PETA as a source is completely negated by non-vegans (at least I've seen that largely influence how I have to reference PETA in my activism).

We want to diminish the perspective that PETA is unreasonable to bring more people on board.  I'll take progression no matter how small, and continue to fight for more. I'm not going to follow a path of absolutism, it might make PETA and others feel good about themselves; I'm much more interested in progress over time.

TriciaLeb,2020-05-28 15:32:01,fs3j5q4,t3_grr78d,t1_fs3hmwl,"People will call PETA ridiculous for anything it does. That's the nature of being an activist. LOTS of people called me ridiculous for protesting Ringling Bros. Circus in 2013, but they're not laughing now.  Fishing is portrayed as a harmless activity by SO many games (including ones that I play! So not judging anyone's game choices). This is damaging to fishes and to our world, period.  Activism is about getting the word out, denormalizing things that others might see as perfectly fine despite the harm it causes. Of COURSE people will get mad about any way you choose to do that. They'll say, ""Protesting in the streets isn't the right way!"" ""Calling people out on social media isn't the right way!"" ""Blocking traffic isn't the right way!"" ""Kneeling during a football game isn't the right way!"" Because to people who don't like what you have to say, no way of saying it is ""the right way.""  I agree with you about progress, we just disagree with what IS progress. Denormalizing violence against animals is the goal, but you don't reach people by doing things that don't get attention. The fact that people are talking about how absurd it is means they're internalizing the message. It's social change strategy 101.  I GET where you're coming from, I really do. I was once a PETA-hater myself, many many moons ago. But when I  finally started doing animal activism about a decade ago (after having been ""into animal rights"" for a decade before that without actually taking to the street or doing anything other than not eating animals), I realized how hard it was to get people to pay attention to animal rights issues. No one wants to think about the ways in which they do harm. So they bury their heads in the sand and never talk about it. I'd MUCH rather them talk about how ""stupid"" PETA's protest of virtual fishing is for them to never consider how fishes suffer when they are dragged from their homes and suffocated.  The fact that you are talking about that protest at all makes my point for me! Did you hear about the time [PETA gave out free vegan fishless filets in Florida](https://www.peta.org/blog/giant-fish-saving-kind-one-fishless-filet-time/) to promote the end of fishing? Didn't think so."

I'm very supportive of the handing out of free vegan fishless filets; I actually think that's actually very useful and can be used as a tool to persuade others into trying out a vegan lifestyle. I applaud PETA in those efforts.  ""Activism is about getting the word out, denormalizing things that others might see as perfectly fine despite the harm it causes. Of COURSE people will get mad about any way you choose to do that.""  I disagree with ""any way you choose to do that"". I'm for being socially aware and strategic for when that word is delivered. I could bring up Veganism and the negative effects of a meat loaded diet at every single family function I attend, but I know it would only work against me - my family wouldn't be convinced; they'd just be annoyed that I won't stop talking about it and it might result in them growing a disdain for the cause.  Instead, I could persuade them and be intentional in how I go about showing them that a vegan lifestyle has an incredible amount of benefits. I could work on myself to be someone who is physically and mentally fit even on the diet that they are so skeptical of. Intentional persuasion is more useful and will result in a faster movement towards a vegan world.  That's all I'm getting at here - Animal Crossing is not the game to go after. More social awareness is all I'm asking for; go after ""Big Buck Hunters"" if you're going to start a feud with a game - not a video game that literally has leather alternatives within the game, and does a genuinely good job educating people on animals."

These blogs are lighthearted ways to get attention to important issues. The blog post in question was ALL over the news when it went live, because it was timely, relevant (since Animal Crossing is currently culturally relevant), and a little bit absurd.  Sometimes I feel like we vegans think that everyone already knows the issues. They don‚Äôt. Vegans make up about 2% of the population by the most generous estimations. PETA isn‚Äôt trying to reach you. You‚Äôre already on the animals‚Äô side. They‚Äôre trying to reach people who have never heard of veganism and animal rights.  When a nonvegan gets upset about PETA‚Äôs animal crossing guide, they can have a nice long laugh about how PETA cares about virtual fish. In the meantime, they‚Äôll be made aware that some people are against fishing. Not something most people really consider (I grew up in a super small town in the Southern US and I know I certainly never considered that some large group of people were against fishing, even after I‚Äôd sworn it off as a child when I saw a poor fish have his/her eye poked out with a hook).  Animal Crossing and PETA win from this one. I PROMISE you Animal Crossing is happy with nearly any publicity because that‚Äôs what marketing is.  And the point about the fishless filet giveaway was that you‚Äôd never heard of it! I appreciate food giveaways as much as the next person, and I have done more of them than I could possibly count. I can remember getting press at exactly one of them, and that was a PETA one that had some other press gimmick attached to it. Def great for local outreach, but not shifting the cultural narrative IMO."

oldnewbieprogrammer,2020-05-28 16:50:33,fs3tbjk,t3_grr78d,t1_fs34bv1,"\&gt;Calling them the exact same thing minimizes their societal and cultural impact  Comparisons do not mean they are the exact same thing. It means there are  things similar and for what we're talking about (abuse, oppression and suffering) they can be compared. Edit: Just to be clear, I'm not the person above you replied to, I disagree they are \*exactly\* the same, just pointing out they are very comparable when it comes to many aspects.  You can compare apples and trains as long as the element you're comparing is in both. I can say, on average trains are bigger than apples, because both have size. I can say apples are softer than trains, because both have density. I can't say Apples have more juice than trains because trains don't have juice so it makes no sense.  Just because two things are not the same, doesn't necessarily mean they can't be compared in some ways.  \&gt;A chicken can‚Äôt write 12 Years a Slave.  If we judge value by their ability to write a best selling book, very few humans are valuable.  \&gt;It diminishes the value of human life and suffering in the eyes of many.  In the eyes of many, everything about veganism diminishes the value of human life and suffering. If you get involved in debates, you'll hear it all the time. This is not a valid argument as the reality is, there is no inherent ""Value"" in any life.  Talking about the value of A VS B, first requires you to justify your value claims. Why is a human more valuable than a cow? Don't get me wrong, if a human and a cow were both drowning, most of the time I'd rescue the human, but if it was my cow and the human was Hitler, I'd rescue my cow, because all value is created by actions, connections, past history and more and exists solely in the mind of the person making the value judgement.  Saying X lowers the value of humans, is really just saying ""I don't think X is as valuable as humans"". Which, coming from a human, makes sense, but it's important to remember that that's just a subjective value that you have placed on something, it's not inherent, it's not ""right"", and it's not objective.  \&gt;We‚Äôre much more evolved beings capable of so much  There's no such thing as ""more"" evolved, that's not how evolution works. The only reason you believe human life is more important is because you're human. If you were a cow you wouldn't give a rat's ass about 12 Years a Slave, or any other human achievement that didn't involve improving the life of cows. You'd be saying ""How dare humans compare their paltry 20 Million dead holocaust to the billions of us that they torture, abuse and kill every year?""  Saying humans are more valuable because we're capable of so much would ringer truer if we weren't in the midst of a human created pandemic, while waiting to see just how bad the human created climate change is going to damage our world's ecosystem. Not to even start on the multitude of other human created problems going on every day in our society, or the numerous holocausts and genocides where humans rounded up and mass murdered millions of their own species for lies. Maybe cows should be considered more valuable because they don't commit atrocities against other cows... Value depends on who is judging and what attributes you are looking at to make that value judgement. Humans judge ourselves based on our best qualities and ignore the horror-show that goes on everyday. I've never seen a white cow kneel on a black cow's neck and choke it to death.  \------  To be clear, I don't often use the holocaust as a comparison simply because so many people react poorly to it. I just go with dog fighting or something along those lines. But the comparison \*\*is\*\* 100% valid.  It's also important to remember what PETA does. They aren't here to placate people, share vegan recipes and encourage Meatless Mondays (not only anyway). They are here to grow the movement. To do that you need media attention, and these comparisons do that very well. The more people we have talking about these things, the more the message is getting out.  ""But they create anger!!""  The anger is already there. What they actually create are learning opportunities. people get angry, say ""How dare they compare X!?"" and then it's our (activists) job to gently explain ""They aren't the same, but both are horrible and neither is something we should support."" PETA's PR department's job is to create media attention, and they do that.   I've had plenty of conversations, like this one, that starts with people saying ""How could PETA do this?!?!"" and then you explain how they could, and most of the time the other person leaves with understanding, they don't always agree, but there is a definite method to PETA's madness, and judging from the number of activists who put PETA as the one who introduced them to these ideas, it works."

oldnewbieprogrammer,2020-05-28 16:58:55,fs3uerw,t3_grr78d,t1_fs1e35u,"The reality is this isn't a PETA problem, this is a Society problem. Peta is like the adult that has to deal with 7 billion whining children that want to breed thousands of animals, abandon them to the streets to suffer, starve and be abused, but then gets angry when an adult comes along and says we shouldn't be doing that and tries to help get the situation under control.     So the question becomes, do you have a better idea? What we need is an organization that can handle housing, feeding and giving medical care to hundreds of thousands of dogs, many of which are un-adoptable and suffering from horrific health conditions that will cost vast amounts of money and time to deal with.     So you need lots of land, a huge facility, large numbers of volunteers and millions upon millions of dollars every year. Once you've got that, reach out to PETA management and let them know because everyone is waiting for this solution, and yet no one has been able to make it sustainable. Instead everyone sits around whining that PETA is mean while they completely ignore the reality of the situation, but I'm sure you're not one of those whinging children, I'm sure you have a real solution all lined up! So let's hear it!"
YourThoughtsHaveBeen,2020-05-28 17:41:15,fs3zv7t,t3_grr78d,t1_fs3si3t,"Genuinely think you're missing the mark here but I appreciate the back and forth.   You are seeing PETA's efforts towards Animal Crossing as ""hilarious and undeniably effective"", the rest of the world sees it as ridiculous, over the top, and out of touch. I'd love you to show me or link me to any positive reaction to this campaign, and any minds it swayed in the process.  I do not agree with the perspective of ""all media is good media"". I work for a marketing company and this kind of perspective falls flat when it results in general opinion of your company being negative. There are effective marketing campaigns, and there are bad marketing campaigns. This is an example of a bad one.  I thank you for engaging me though, and appreciate your efforts towards the same thing I'm trying to achieve."
americanjizz,2020-05-28 19:43:05,fs4fbms,t3_grr78d,t1_fs3uerw,"I get that it‚Äôs a huge problem, that it‚Äôs not PETA‚Äôs fault, and that no real solution exists now. But how does that justify *killing* them?  Again, would it be right to euthanize thousands of orphans if we couldn‚Äôt find a home for them?  I don‚Äôt have a solution, but I do have a more ethical alternative than what PETA does: set the animals free. Sure some will die, but many will not. If even 1 out of 1000 manages to survive and live a happy life (who knows, maybe someone will find them and adopt them?) then it‚Äôll all be worth it."
TriciaLeb,2020-05-28 20:01:19,fs4hmsn,t3_grr78d,t1_fs3zv7t,"I too appreciate the conversation and efforts. I do understand what you are saying, but I have been in this movement for a very long time, and I don‚Äôt look at the immediate impacts of an action as the metric by which we judge them.  For example, disrupting fur-wearers/designers at fashion shows was once seen as obnoxious and absurd. People complained about it constantly and said it did more harm than good. Twenty years later most major fashion brands are fur-free because the public perception has changed. It did not change by accident.  PETA plays the long game, and PETA doesn‚Äôt really care about its public perception in the short term (as someone on r/vegancirclejerk so eloquently put it, ‚ÄúPETA gives absolutely zero fucks about butthurt omnis‚Äù). The only thing PETA cares about is that people are talking about animals, because anyone who really thinks about animals for any extended period of time can tell that vegans and PETA are on the right side of history.  As I often say, two billion individuals died today. Two billion more will die tomorrow, and the next day, and the next, ad infinitum. The numbers are quite literally impossible to comprehend. But every single one of them was a someone just like your dog or my cat, or you or me. We have a moral obligation to bring animals into EVERY conversation, and I will always appreciate PETA‚Äôs commitment to doing just that, regardless of what some people think of them because of it."
oldnewbieprogrammer,2020-05-28 20:25:00,fs4km3q,t3_grr78d,t1_fs4fbms,"So you are suggesting we should leave thousands of pitbulls, rottweilers and other large dogs, to roam the streets in feral packs where they will be starving, abused, and aggressive? And you don't see a problem here?  I've lived in a country with a feral dog problem for a decade, they were mostly little chihuahua sized dogs and they were already known for biting people, attacking children and being a huge nuisance to everyone. I'll give you one guess what happens to them, \*hint\* it's not adoption, it's usually being beaten to death by someone they annoyed or slowly and painfully dying of disease...  I applaud your desire for a better solution, and I agree I wish we had one, but we don't. Until we do, the kindest thing I can see to do is to put them down so they don't have to suffer in this horrifically immoral world we have created. PETA is doing that because no one else will, blaming PETA for it, is gaslighting of the highest order. The humans paying breeders to breed more animals while millions sit unadopted are to blame.  And comparing all of this to our treatment of orphans is silly. We take care of orphans (somewhat), we don't leave them on the streets to suffer, get abused and die. If you want to treat these animals like orphans, again, find the money, space, people, time and energy to do so. No one else has been able to, but maybe you can, so get on it!"
americanjizz,2020-05-28 20:53:10,fs4o4nw,t3_grr78d,t1_fs4km3q,"Honestly you make a good point, in my mind I (naively?) pictured stray dogs as just fearfully wandering around searching the trash for food, and didn‚Äôt think of the possibility of them becoming a nuisance/danger to humans. That is indeed a real problem.  But I guess I must come back (again) to my point... the problem here is that I‚Äôm seeing the situation in a purely ethical way, and you in a more pragmatical one... anyway here it goes: If orphan children were running around attacking people and being aggressive, should they be put down? Sorry!"
oldnewbieprogrammer,2020-05-28 21:06:37,fs4prwl,t3_grr78d,t1_fs4o4nw,"My point is that ""purely ethical"" doesn't work in our society because we're not an ethical society.      \&gt;If orphan children were running around attacking people and being aggressive, should they be put down?      No, they should be helped. Failing that they should be housed. Failing that... I don't know what you can do. if the choice is to leave society to be overrun with feral orphans who commit crime, attack others, and suffer horribly until they die young and in pain... I don't know.      I tend to try and approach everything from a ""What would I want to be done to me if I was in that situation?"" and honestly, put me down. Don't get me wrong, if there's money for rehab, put me in rehab. If there's a shelter, put me in shelter. If there's hope, let me fight for it. But if there's no hope and the best I can ever look forward to is to fight, hurt others, steal, and die young and in pain... what's the point? Put me down and let me move on to the next life because this one wouldn't be worth living.      For me, it's about hope. If there's hope for these dogs, help them. But there isn't. There's too many, they're unwanted, many are sick and diseased, many others are so badly abused that they can't be trusted to not be violent...     I complete get your point, and I struggled writing all of this because my brain is screaming ""NO! Orphans/dogs must be helped!"" And it's right, but what if there is no help...? It's not nice, my brain hates the idea of it, but it's the reality in which we find ourselves."

But to give you the basics, we absolutely are NOT against pit bulls- our policies regarding pit bills are all focused on protecting them from abandonment and abuse. We are against breeding pit bulls, just like we are against breeding any and all dogs and cats while millions die each year due to a lack of good homes. And we see more pit bulls being abandoned in shelters, and abused by cruel people than any other dog breed, so if you care about pit bulls, as we do, it is especially urgent to address these issues. PETA's community fieldworkers see some of the most devastating cases imaginable, and the number of pit bulls who they find starving and neglected on chains in backyards, or beaten, tormented, sick, injured, and in other states of misery is staggering.

The entire point of intersectionality is to acknowledge all experiences of oppression, but also to fight where it is most needed to address those inequalities.  Historically, civil rights fights have left out the most marginalized. White women threw women of colour under the bus to further their own goals. Well-off white gay men who lived lives most similar to their straight counterparts threw trans people and ""less respectable"" queer folk under the bus to get marriage equality, which didn't address any of the other issues queer folk were having (health care, primarily.)

Inasaba,2020-06-03 13:24:40,fsqt5wu,t3_gvjceh,t1_fsqsvau,"People of colour, queer people, and other oppressed peoples all over the world *are* suffering. This is what the worst forms of oppression do.   It's fine to fight for animals: they indeed are oppressed a lot and suffering badly. But it's not okay to completely discount and ignore other suffering just because you don't relate to it."
Lexithym,2020-06-03 13:24:44,fsqt67e,t3_gvjceh,t1_fspg5xi,"Using technology that comes from slavery like Work conditions isnt vegan either imo. Still most ""vegans "" use those."
Lexithym,2020-06-03 13:27:54,fsqtic8,t3_gvjceh,t1_fsqt5wu,Everyone is suffering. I just concentrate on those who i believe have it the worst.
Inasaba,2020-06-03 13:33:12,fsqu2ei,t3_gvjceh,t1_fsqt67e,"Some of us have avoided this by getting used electronics. The issue you bring up is an unfortunate side effect to modern life that many people don't know they may be actively contributing to. Being racist is an *active* and malicious form of oppression. They are hardly comparable.   What you have just done is called ""whataboutism."" We hate it when omnis do it to us, so why are you doing it now?"
Lexithym,2020-06-03 13:44:58,fsqvcxy,t3_gvjceh,t1_fsqu2ei, Because I believe it is  whataboutism what the poster did and I wanted to show it this way.   Most of the time racism isnt active nor malicious. But I dont care whether actions are Active or Malicious I care about the consequences of those actions.   Animals suffering in factory farms is also a side effect of the modern lifestyle. I dont think that makes something acceptable.
Inasaba,2020-06-03 13:56:03,fsqwl4n,t3_gvjceh,t1_fsqvcxy,"&gt; Most of the time racism isnt active nor malicious.  This shows that you are ignorant to the plights of racialized people. You seem to have not read this article, which I implore you to do, and also to read up on the realities of modern day race relations in the United States. Doing this research will not impede your animal rights activism in any way and will actually help you in your outreach."
Inasaba,2020-06-03 14:21:38,fsqzifz,t3_gvjceh,t1_fsqtic8,"This is exactly what intersectionality is about, as I stated above. What you are overlooking is that you have not been properly informed about the realities of many people's experiences, so you do not have a real idea of who is suffering ""worst."" It is worth reading about.   At the very least, stop with the whataboutisms and just stand up and state that you support the struggle for justice and accountability that black folks in the US are currently calling for. Introspect how you personally uphold the status quo ‚Äî because unless we actively fight it, we *all* uphold it. Doing these things costs you nothing.  [Here are some small things that you can do for racial justice.](https://medium.com/equality-includes-you/what-white-people-can-do-for-racial-justice-f2d18b0e0234)"
Lexithym,2020-06-03 14:29:28,fsr0fdi,t3_gvjceh,t1_fsqwl4n,I am sorry if I have offended you. I dont see racism from a usa centric view.  You implied that buying technology is not active and my point was that most racist actions are not more active than buying technology.  Why should I read up on racism in the USA?  I would rather put my energy in some other cause.  I am not saying it is not important. I am just saying you can be vegan and not really care about what is going on in the us .
BertieTheDoggo,2020-06-03 14:35:48,fsr165y,t3_gvjceh,t1_fsqrdd9,This conversation was great
Inasaba,2020-06-03 14:47:50,fsr2m8z,t3_gvjceh,t1_fsr0fdi,"&gt; Why should I read up on racism in the USA?   Because the same systems exist everywhere, though they may not be as obvious. And like I said, it doesn't take away from your animal activism. You could be using the time you're wasting right now arguing with me in a more constructive way, like learning about how humans are still oppressed and suffering in this world and why ignoring it is being complicit in it.  I'm not from the US either, but I still care about the suffering of racialized people."
Moritzzzu,2020-06-03 15:42:28,fsr9fd2,t3_gvjceh,t1_fsqt5wu,Are queers and blacks getting holocusted by the billions? I think not.
Inasaba,2020-06-03 15:45:35,fsr9u3z,t3_gvjceh,t1_fsr9fd2,And this is why oppressed people roll their eyes at vegans.
Moritzzzu,2020-06-03 15:47:11,fsra1dy,t3_gvjceh,t1_fspl7q0,"You dont need love, empathy or compassion to be vegan, ethics and logic alone can lead you to veganism."
Moritzzzu,2020-06-03 15:48:54,fsra9ab,t3_gvjceh,t1_fsr9u3z,Instead of vaguely implying something you could answer with a clear argument. Why should an activist not spend his time on the worst issues?
Inasaba,2020-06-03 15:50:53,fsraip7,t3_gvjceh,t1_fsra9ab,"As I said before, because you probably do not have a clear picture of what ""the worst issues"" are.  You are sealioning and I will not continue this any further."
Moritzzzu,2020-06-03 15:52:59,fsras9z,t3_gvjceh,t1_fsraip7,Wtf? Are you telling me animals arent the worst opressed?  And what is sealioning?
VA_Throwaway64,2020-06-04 15:52:45,fsvde6k,t3_gvjceh,t1_fsvbwb6,"I think if they want to then it's not really a problem. As long as they're not forcing members to come, but I don't think any vegan activist group does that anyways. Would be kinda cool to see anonymous for the voiceless do one of their set ups but for black lives matter instead"
sheilastretch,2020-06-04 16:16:44,fsvgg8d,t3_gvjceh,t1_fspavuo,"I specifically see veganism as beneficial to humans who are badly treated within the livestock and fishing industries. Most people working at slaughter houses are immigrants and/or have darker skin. They are abused, taken advantage of, work in horrible and dangerous conditions where they suffer serious injuries, emotional trauma, and have some of the highest death rates, comparable to police and military occupations. There are other examples like those who work in tanneries who work with dangerous chemicals, rotting flesh which carries deadly diseases, and also have disgustingly high death rates compared to other job sectors.    It pisses me off when people act like my concern for animals means I can't care about my fellow humans. Rather, I want us to work towards a system that doesn't prey on or abuse *anyone* regardless of what species/race/culture/religion/orientation they are a part of. I specifically chose veganism because it covers so many of my concerns at once, from social justice to water conservation, food scarcity to air pollution, deforestation to ocean health.  By the way, thanks for posting this article. I thought it was well written. I hope more people read it and take the writer's words to heart, because we all need to support each other if we want a fair world :)"
aca4eva,2020-06-05 06:21:01,fsy3cdi,t3_gvjceh,t1_fsvgg8d,wow thank you so much for this comment! loved how you worded everything. and yes i agree. many people tend to think that veganism is mainly and/or only about the animals. but it encompasses a WIDE variety of all these injustices within the world. which is why it should be advocated for even more from all people.
