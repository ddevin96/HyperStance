On top of that the government re-distributed a lot of wealth which benefited many Afghanis. The problem was that ultra conservatives, primarily from the North opposed all those policies, hence the head of government started having protestors killed in droves. The Head of State realised the HoG was a nut job and was bleeding popular support so he asked the USSR to intervene against reactionaries and depose the HoG and the USSR did just that, but not before the Hog had the HoS killed. It’s all a mess really."

Yet it did, by about a decade.  When the communist regimes in Eastern Europe were falling without support from Moscow, the Kabul government was successfully consolidating power.  Arguably, the lack of foreign control is one of the reasons the communist government lasted so long."

This post is asking for **evidence** that the communist government enjoyed popular support of **the masses**. I cited a book by a historian where he specifically details how the communist government never was popular, and therefore had to start imprisoning protesters in mass. I’m asking for evidence that contradicts that. So far no one has provided anything. Sound like it’s settled that the Communist government was very tyrannical. Thought this sub would at least try to defend them but I guess we can at least agree in this case"

BalticBolshevik,2020-01-02 02:28:40,fct3rtu,t3_ei7el2,t1_fcs61l3,"I’ll make a minor correction since I was both speaking in reductionist terms and not remembering every detail of the documentaries I watched a while back. Women might’ve had de jure universal suffrage but they didn’t have de facto universal suffrage, this is a common occurrence when oppressors try to score progressive points. In Northern Ireland after  Northern Irish locals were granted equal voting rights to English settlers they were regularly blocked from entering polling stations by the local governments previously elected by the settlers and by the settlers themselves. In the US even after African-Americans were given the vote, in the South literacy requirements were introduced for voters, Black people were disproportionally poorer due to slavery and due to how much of a failure reconstruction was, white people were given a way out through the Grandfather Clause which allowed people to vote if their parents or grandparents had voted meaning many poor/illiterate white people could vote too. In Afghanistan most women were housewives and didn’t have the opportunities to go out and vote, courts weren’t very widespread and therefore enforcement of universal suffrage wasn’t either. When in 1978 the socialists granted women equal rights in all areas, such as marriage, education, careers, etc, the Afghan Women’s Council was set up to help improve education and literacy rates among women and to encourage them to go out and vote, hence moving toward de facto equality."
GhettoNeddo,2020-01-02 02:35:30,fct4bg2,t3_ei7el2,t1_fct3rtu,Okay that makes sense
supercooper25,2020-01-02 04:23:25,fctcjgz,t3_ei7el2,t1_fcsuwc8,"&gt;Successfully consolidating power isn’t proof that a government is popular.  Every regime in the history of the world has required a certain degree of popular legitimacy to maintain power, that the Afghan communist government survived as long as it did without any foreign support is enough evidence to prove the existence of a significant support base. Now of course whether or not they had a majority backing is a different question entirely, it may very well be the case that they didn't, but Marxists aren't really interested in pure numbers so much as class, especially in semi-feudal countries like Afghanistan where the proletariat is only a small minority.

Lanfranc_di_Cambria,2020-01-02 05:15:05,fctg1vc,t3_ei7el2,t1_fcsw15c,"Here is a quote from Afghanistan: A cultural and political history. It describes how the masses saw the Soviet regime and their opponents:  &gt;The international funders justified their support of the Afghan conflict in ways that had little relevance within Afghanistan. They portrayed the struggle in Afghanistan as a Manichaean conflict of competing ideologies (e.g., Islam versus atheism, socialism versus capitalism, freedom versus oppression, feudal reactionaries versus progressive patriots, modernists versus traditionalists).   &gt;Afghans never saw the war they were fighting in such black-and-white terms because politics in Afghanistan was less ideological and more personal. It was a world where yesterday's enemy might become today's ally, meaning you should take no one for granted.   &gt;The mujahideen parties, for instance, had good connections with Kabul government bureaucrats throughout the war and could generally get any information they needed from them. Such bureaucrats sent the message that no matter who held the top positions and set policy, they were the functionaries who kept a government running.   &gt;Defections from one side to another were based more on personal disputes and private interests than on any ideology. If a village son rose high in the PDPA's ranks, one could be sure that the district would throw its lot in with Kabul. If he defected or was purged, that district was sure to discover the merits of the resistance.   &gt;Even more common was spreading risk by placing different community members in rival camps to protect the group as a whole. At the national level, the philosophical differences between the resistance and the Kabul regime, which seemed so sharp when the war began, blurred with time.  It seems that *the masses* hedged their bets."

flesh_eating_turtle,2020-01-05 02:16:27,fd6gdfw,t3_ek6a0o,t3_ek6a0o,"What do you mean ""refuse capital?"" It's impossible to avoid taking sides in this sort of conflict; attempting to remain neutral is just another way of complacently supporting your own government. Lenin wrote an entire piece dealing specifically with this issue:  * [Marxists Internet Archive | ""The Defeat of One's Own Government in the Imperialist War"" by V.I. Lenin](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1915/jul/26.htm)  As Lenin says:  &gt;Those who accept the “neither victory-nor-defeat” slogan can only be hypocritically in favour of the class struggle, of “disrupting the class truce”; in practice, such people are renouncing an independent proletarian policy because they subordinate the proletariat of all belligerent countries to the absolutely bourgeois task of safeguarding the imperialist governments against defeat. The only policy of actual, not verbal disruption of the “class truce”, of acceptance of the class struggle, is for the proletariat to take advantage of the difficulties experienced by its government and its bourgeoisie in order to overthrow them. This, however, cannot be achieved or striven for, without desiring the defeat of one’s own government and without contributing to that defeat.  During an imperialist war, a Marxist living in an imperialist country must support the defeat of their own government. To refrain from doing so is to take an essentially reactionary position."

flesh_eating_turtle,2020-01-05 02:27:16,fd6ht0v,t3_ek6a0o,t1_fd6hei8,"No one is saying that you should *hope* a war occurs; the point is that if a conflict has to occur (which seems rather likely, given the current situation), a Marxist should take an anti-imperialist stance, supporting the defeat of their own government. We do not put the class struggle on hold in times of war; we continue and intensify it, even at the cost of our own country's war effort.  EDIT: Another good quote from Lenin's piece, which sums the issue up quite well:  &gt;Whoever is in favour of the slogan of “neither victory nor defeat” is consciously or unconsciously a chauvinist; at best he is a conciliatory petty bourgeois but in any case he is an *enemy* to proletarian policy, a partisan of the existing governments, of the present-day ruling classes."

flesh_eating_turtle,2020-01-05 02:41:02,fd6jnz3,t3_ek6a0o,t1_fd6isry,"I think this position is (to put it bluntly) short-sighted and dogmatic. When the world's largest imperialist power is bearing down on a less-powerful country (one which it has previously attacked numerous times, no less), refuting to support the smaller nation because we don't like its leaders is, in practice, a pro-imperialist position. Remaining neutral in a conflict with this sort of power imbalance is no better than giving your support to the imperialist power, just as refusing to take part in politics is no better than being a reactionary. If you refuse to *actively oppose* imperialism, then you might as well be supporting it.  Perhaps a historical example will clarify the point. Saddam Hussein was no great Marxist hero, but nonetheless, communists gave our solidarity to Iraq *against the imperialist invasion.* This is not because we all suddenly became Ba'athists; rather, it is because we oppose the actions of imperialist governments.  You say that you see too many dead working people? Well, so do we. That's why we oppose the imperialist governments who start the wars that kill them.  EDIT: You omitted the next line of that Brecht quote:  &gt;What if they gave a war and nobody came? **Well then, the war would come to you!**  Brecht supported the struggle against imperialism in his own time, despite his stridently anti-war views, because he understood that the end of war requires the end of imperialism."

However, if a war occurs, to refuse your support to the weaker nation when imperialists are attempting to crush it is to fail in our duty of solidarity to the oppressed.  Think of the logical extension of your position here. When Iraq was invaded, would you have advocated standing by and doing nothing? Or when the United States interfered in Libya to help overthrow Gaddafi, which led to the mass impoverishment and misery of the Libyan people; would you advocate neutrality on our part, because Gaddafi was not a Marxist?

However, you realize that the kid he's beating up is somebody who you really don't like. Your friend suggests that you intervene, but you say ""I don't like either of them,"" and do nothing. Now, is there any *practical* difference between neutrality, and supporting the bully? After all, the outcome is the same: the smaller kid gets beaten up, and the bully gets what he wants. The fact that you get to feel good about not supporting a bad government is *useless* to the Iranian people who will die in a senseless war.  &gt;I never suggested sitting back and allowing a US attack.  So you support communists taking action to obstruct and oppose American attacks on Iran? Because if you don't, then you *are* suggesting that we sit back and allow a US attack."

If one mafia dominating another implies the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people in the second mafia's territory (which it *invariably* does when the US goes to war), then for us to refuse to intervene because we oppose them both is practically to allow the deaths to occur.  We are not in a practical position to immediately overthrow the US government and prevent them from going to war in Iran. From an actual, realistic perspective, supporting the Iranians in any war against the USA is the only real option.

All communists oppose capital internationally, and that means supporting whatever real-world course of action is mostly likely to weaken the capitalist class, and benefit the oppressed.  In a potential war between the USA and Iran, an Iranian victory would be better for the Iranian people (who wouldn't be occupied by the USA), and inconsequential for the American people (who would go back to their lives. An American victory would be a *disaster* for the Iranian people, and probably worse for the American people as well, who would be roped into a continuous war of occupation.  &gt;Are you one of those Posadists or something?  Yeah, because saying that ""if a conflict is inevitable, we should support whichever side is most likely to weaken imperialist capitalism,"" is the same thing as believing that nuclear war is going to bring us into contact with aliens who will guide us to communism.

One of these outcomes is demonstrably worse than the other. *There is no third option.* In theoretical terms, we communists oppose both governments. But in the real world, *one has to win.* If we are really concerned about the oppressed people of the world, we must do our best to bring about the outcome which will benefit them the most.  For the record, I'm a Maoist, so I don't like the current Chinese government. However, if the USA tried to go to war with them, I would support the PRC without a moment's hesitation.

The primary reason for the famine was that peasants were, at gunpoint, forced to produce steel to bolster the available resources of the state instead of growing enough food to survive the year."

Once again, the communists are the ones who end up ending famines in and area that had once been historically prone to them. You have to look at the material conditions surrounding events instead of just condemning them as evil authoritarianism. As for the execution of secret police members like the NKVD chief Yezhov that was done because he had gone too far and caused countless people to die. Were the Great purges bad? Of course, but once again, material conditions must be taken into account. Any paranoia on behalf of the Soviets is understandable due to past events.

This, in turn, raised the quotas, with the same punishments for those who failed to meet them. While natural disasters were originally to blame for the famine, the fact that China possessed enough grain at the start of the famine to avoid it and the government failed to distribute it to the rural communities based on a perceived lack of need due to earlier, authoritarian policies highlights the economic drawbacks of strict authoritarianism. As for Stalin's purges, his unchecked power allowed him to act on his paranoia and slaughter his officers.

The situation in China is a bit more unique - despite the failings of the party-line in the past such as the Great Leap Forward, China has a consistently decreasing poverty rate and is the second largest economy in the world. Additionally, when compared to a post-colonial state like India, China has a much higher life expectancy rate and a much lower child mortality rate.  If we compare the socioeconomic situation in India before independence versus post-independence and China before Communist party rule versus post-Communist party rule, China wins out in essentially every single factor - and that is the most telling fact to me.

spookyjohnathan,2020-01-05 13:31:52,fd9bo9o,t3_ek8p9v,t3_ek8p9v,"Forgive my canned responses. There's a lot to cover here. Some of it is only tangentially related to your question but I think it brings up some interesting points that should be covered nonetheless.  *[copy/paste]*  [Social ownership of the means of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism) never killed anyone, so the policy that all socialists advocate in common is responsible for precisely zero deaths.  The public has a right to use public resources to build a public means of production so they can [work for themselves and keep the fruit of their labor to themselves,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_each_according_to_his_contribution) just like we build public military to protect ourselves, and public education to educate ourselves.  If reactionaries try to infringe this right, we have the right to defend ourselves from them, the same as anyone has any right to defend himself from an aggressor, so socialists who fought for this right are responsible for precisely zero deaths; those deaths lie at the feet of [the aggressors, who resorted to violence to stop us from exercising our rights, and forced us to defend ourselves.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_involvement_in_regime_change#Cold_War_Era)  Policies that have nothing to do with the implementation of social ownership of the means of production, like [the eradication of sparrows under Mao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Pests_Campaign) which backfired, causing crops to fail when it turned out that the sparrows did more to protect crops than harm them, may have caused many deaths, but they have absolutely nothing to do with socialism. Chinese farmers had considered sparrows pests for generations, [and many capitalist countries still do](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_tree_sparrow#Relationships_with_humans) - if China had been a capitalist country during its industrialization and modernization, the result would have been the same. Eradicating pest species, even ones that turn out to be beneficial, is not unique to socialist countries. In this regard, socialism is responsible for precisely zero deaths.  For deaths in socialist countries that were the result of the actions of non-socialists, I have this to say. It's something I discuss a lot, so forgive the canned response.  *[copy/paste]*  [Russia experienced severe famine on average every decade under the Tsars.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droughts_and_famines_in_Russia_and_the_Soviet_Union) The USSR inherited a society that was still largely un-industrialized in the 30s. They modernized it, and at every point after that, [they produced more food than the US.](https://artir.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/compar1.png?w=640) Even during the crash before the dissolution, the worst part in the modern era, they were producing more food than the US during every point before 1975. [These facts come from no other source than the US government itself.](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000498133.pdf)  There were famines every decade under the Czars, after the Nazi invasion the Soviets rebuilt their country and they ended famines in the USSR permanently. The famines didn't return to North and Central Asia until the adoption of capitalism; [there have been three major food shortages since then, with the old pattern apparently resuming.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droughts_and_famines_in_Russia_and_the_Soviet_Union#Post-Soviet_Russia)  *[copy/paste]*  The last famines in the USSR were during the Nazi [Siege of Leningrad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Leningrad) and in [1946-47, when the country was trying to rebuild after the Nazis invaded the heartland and destroyed hundreds of miles of agricultural development.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_famine_of_1946%E2%80%9347) There were only two other major famines before that; the first during the Russian Civil War, [which ended as soon as the Bolsheviks won and took power,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droughts_and_famines_in_Russia_and_the_Soviet_Union#cite_note-7) and the famine in Ukraine between 1932-33, when [the landowning class in Ukraine hoarded and then destroyed nearly 90 million head of cattle and immeasurable amounts of grain.](https://books.google.com/books?id=Bp31GmfH-6YC&amp;pg=PA159#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) That's about 7 million tons of meat from cattle and likely twice as much grain, between [two and four tons of food for every person who died during the famine.](https://lb.ua/news/2010/01/14/19793_nalivaychenko_nazval_kolichestvo_zh.html)  This is not my argument. It's the argument of a fervent capitalist who made it his mission in life to discredit the USSR at every turn, [the professional anti-Communist propagandist Robert Conquest,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Conquest#The_IRD_years) and even according to him, the pro-capitalist landowning class in the Ukraine destroyed literally tons of food for every starving person in the USSR.  It's ridiculous to blame socialism for the deaths caused by the devastation of a Nazi invasion, or the deliberate and willful destruction of food by landowners to keep the peasant class hungry and dependent. In these cases, socialism is responsible for precisely zero deaths.  *[copy/paste]*  &gt;...Soviet executions?  A quick rundown of some terms I think most people here will agree with, so that we can address the question of exactly what it means to be anti-communist in a communist society.  [A communist society is a classless, stateless, moneyless society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism) built on a socialist economy, [a socialist economy being one where the means of production is socially owned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism) so that workers can use it to [work for themselves and keep the value of what they produce for themselves.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_each_according_to_his_contribution)  This is opposed to [capitalism, where the means of production is privately owned so that workers use it to work for the private owner who keeps the value of what was produced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism) and pays the workers [a wage, which by definition, is less than the value of what was produced, so the owner can extract profit from the work of others.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_labour)  So, to oppose allowing people to work for themselves on a socially owned means of production, and to wish to re-create conditions that require them to sell themselves to the rich in order to survive is a serious problem.  An even more serious problem are the monarchist loyalists and other people who wanted to return the USSR to its previous state, which is hardly even a step removed from abject feudalism, and the fascists who wanted to turn the USSR into something even worse than the monarchists.  Does that mean all of these people deserved to die? No, of course not. Unfortunately, when you have the entire world against you, just waiting to exploit any weakness, and malicious groups working from within to destabilize the fragile society you're trying to build and spread the influence of those who wish to re-enslave you, not to mention fascists gaining strength and amassing an army at your borders like the USSR did, drastic measures are necessary.  That said, the purges only affected a minority of people in the party or working in government. It wasn't a problem that affected the average person at all, and even among the people who were charged, the overwhelming majority weren't executed for their crimes. Many served punitive sentences and most were rehabilitated. I think that's the least we could do, to give everyone at least a chance of being part of the new, better world we're trying to build.  &gt; ...Stalin dictator/political repression?  One of Stalin's closest advisers and the person who eventually filled his role after his death, [Nikita Krushchev, was anti-Stalin,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikita_Khrushchev) so I don't think the situation in the USSR was anything like capitalist propagandists have made it out to be.  Krushchev had this to say about Stalin -  ""And here was something interesting (which was also characteristic of Stalin): this man, in a flairup of anger, could do a lot of harm. But when you demonstrated to him that you were right and if  you adduced good facts, he would understand in the end that this was a man who was defending a useful cause, and would support you... Yes, there were cases when you could firmly disagree with him and if he was convinced you were right, then he would yield his own point of view and take the point of view of his interlocutor.""  Here is a man who opposed Stalin, debated, argued, and deliberated with him to his face on a regular basis, and still went on to lead the USSR after Stalin's death. Stalin simply isn't the dictator he's made out to be.  All of this isn't to say that I have no criticism of the USSR. I think there were times when mistakes were made, and some of them had disastrous consequences. After Stalin the gradual liberalization of the USSR is by far the most egregious one, but there are also examples that other users here might bring up, things I'm still learning about and may still be on the fence about, but presented above are the specific subjects being discussed in the OP, and my opinions on them as I understand them based on the facts I've presented.  It's worth noting that although I'm glad to discuss this information here, I don't think much of it has very much to do with the concept of social ownership of the means of production. Stalin might have preferred apples to oranges, but that doesn't mean eating apples is an inherent part of socialism.  tl;dr - The starvation trope is a myth and miss-attribution of causes, and socialist ""authoritarianism"" is an act of self-defense to protect the rights of the proletariat against those aggressors who wish to undermine it."

This famine killed an estimated 5 million people, primarily affecting the Volga and Ural River regions, and peasants resorted to cannibalism. The famine resulted from the combined effects of economic disturbance because of the Russian Revolution and Russian Civil War, exacerbated by rail systems that could not distribute food efficiently. One of Russia's intermittent droughts in 1921 aggravated the situation to a national catastrophe. Hunger was so severe that it was likely seed-grain would be eaten rather than sown. At one point relief agencies had to give food to railroad staff to get their supplies moved. **The United States sent food and medicine that fed about 11 million people.**  Also...the USSR had no problem with taking handouts from the “evil fascists”"

To sit back and not choose a side, is to allow America to murder hundreds of thousands of Iranian citizens and occupy Iran, which will continue the oppression of the working class and lead to decades of more deaths, i.e Iraq. As communists, we are in a conflict with Capitalism, that is true. But we are also in a conflict with imperialism. It is our duty as communists to go against the imperialist forces, even if the government we're defending is also a reactionary government. Choosing to do nothing, is siding with the oppressors because when you choose to do nothing, and just sit here and say ""Yeah well, they're bad too"" the main bad guys are going to get their way. There is no resistance to them slaughtering Iranian people and occupying that country until it's resources are used up, causing the deaths of hundreds of thousands during the war, and going to total to millions by time the occupiers are done.   Iranian people see their government as illegitimate. But they are going to defend their country to the death from US occupation, because that is seen as the bigger threat to them.

BUT, even if you all don’t believe me that I was talking about the 1932-1933 famine which was as a result of the Holodomor (which obviously all of the communists here will most probably say is “Western propaganda” anyways, so no reason to discuss that because we won’t get anywhere) my point still stands still yet to be refuted. Why couldn’t the all knowing extremely efficient economic planners foresee the Kulaks being pissed off by their policies?

A war that won't get anywhere by time the Iran war kicks off. Your choice is inaction to the imperial forces of the US.

But in regards to your question the planners most likely anticipated pushback from the Kulaks but they had to collectivize in order to try and feed the rest of the population. If they hadn’t collectivized everyone else would have starved except the Kulaks, so it makes sense that they were willing to take the risk in order to secure food for the rest of the population. It’s also hilarious how you can shift the blame from the people who would rather destroy their food than feed their compatriots to the planners and the government that tried to secure food for the rest of the country. You also try and say that there were “many” famines during the Soviet period when in reality there were only 3 serious famines: 1922-23 caused by ww1 and the civil war, 1932-33  caused by poor harvest and sabotage, and 1947 which was a result of ww2 devastation.

But the end in its turn needs to be justified. From the Marxist point of view, which expresses the historical interests of the proletariat, the end is justified if it leads to increasing the power of man over nature and to the abolition of the power of man over man.  “We are to understand then that in achieving this end anything is permissible?” sarcastically demands the Philistine, demonstrating that he understood nothing. That is permissible, we answer, which really leads to the liberation of mankind. Since this end can be achieved only through revolution, the liberating morality of the proletariat of necessity is endowed with a revolutionary character. It irreconcilably counteracts not only religious dogma but every kind of idealistic fetish, these philosophic gendarmes of the ruling class. It deduces a rule for conduct from the laws of the development of society, thus primarily from the class struggle, this law of all laws.  “Just the same,” the moralist continues to insist, “does it mean that in the class struggle against capitalists all means are permissible: lying, frame-up, betrayal, murder, and so on?” Permissible and obligatory are those and only those means, we answer, which unite the revolutionary proletariat, fill their hearts with irreconcilable hostility to oppression, teach them contempt for official morality and its democratic echoers, imbue them with consciousness of their own historic mission, raise their courage and spirit of self-sacrifice in the struggle. Precisely from this it flows that not all means are permissible. When we say that the end justifies the means, then for us the conclusion follows that the great revolutionary end spurns those base means and ways which set one part of the working class against other parts, or attempt to make the masses happy without their participation; or lower the faith of the masses in themselves and their organization, replacing it by worship for the “leaders”. Primarily and irreconcilably, revolutionary morality rejects servility in relation to the bourgeoisie and haughtiness in relation to the toilers, that is, those characteristics in which petty bourgeois pedants and moralists are thoroughly steeped.  These criteria do not, of course, give a ready answer to the question as to what is permissible and what is not permissible in each separate case. There can be no such automatic answers. Problems of revolutionary morality are fused with the problems of revolutionary strategy and tactics. The living experience of the movement under the clarification of theory provides the correct answer to these problems."

Bengal's population had mostly relied on food shipments from Burma, the breadbasket of the eastern end of the subcontinent. That region had been recently occupied by the Japanese. Churchill refused convoys to be shipped to India because he needed a large supply of troop convoys for the landings in France the next year.

flesh_eating_turtle,2020-01-05 20:10:16,fdb8url,t3_ek6a0o,t1_fdb7df7,"The point is not that we have to like the Iranian government; the point is that as Marxists, we are supposed to make an analysis of the real material conditions, and choose whichever action will weaken imperialist capitalism and benefit the oppressed. If the USA and Iran go to war, there are two options:  1. Iran wins: no US occupation, Americans go back to their lives, US government is humiliated and weakened. 2. USA wins: US occupation, Americans roped into continuous war to maintain occupation, US government is strengthened.  Now, outcome #2 is very clearly worse than outcome #1. Thus, if we have to choose (and assuming a war breaks out, we do; there is no third option), we should choose outcome #1.   The duty of Marxists living in the imperialist nations is strive for the defeat of our own government, by continuing the class struggle during wartime. As Lenin wrote:  &gt;A “revolutionary struggle against the war” is merely an empty and meaningless exclamation (something at which the heroes of the Second International excel), *unless* it means revolutionary action against *one’s own government* even in wartime. One has only to do some thinking in order to understand this. Wartime revolutionary action against one’s own government indubitably means, not only desiring its defeat, but really facilitating such a defeat.  The class struggle is not put on hold during wartime; rather, it is continued and intensified, and this inevitably means damaging the war effort of one's own nation. To use the example of Lenin's own time, the Bolsheviks contributed to Russia's defeat in WWI, by taking advantage of the war situation to overthrow the government."

I see this airstrike, that was made in Iraq as a way to show muscle to the Iranians, the US has allies and interests in the middle east which the Iranian government has been attacking, the general was visiting Iraq for a reason after all. So to me it feels like the US feels like Iran is too aggressive when it comes to Iraq and Yemen and wants to make a point not to fuck with them."

Iraq becomes an Iranian vassal, beef between saudi arabia and israel gets worse, nukes get made etc. I see that a Iranian victory, which most socialists think is better would lead to a lot of turmoil/ power imbalance in the region which means even more war. US imperialism is disgusting but to me it feels better to have a somewhat  (i know to us is bad) democratic country to be the powerhouse of the region rather than a theocracy which only cares about 15% of the regions population (the shia Muslims)."

Saddam Hussein was certainly no box of chocolates; he committed human rights abuses, and favored his country's Sunni minority over the Shia majority. But when the USA came in to overthrow him, the situation in the region became *infinitely* worse, as terror groups swept in to fill the vacuum, and Iraq's resources were privatized.

The grow of crops is a physical and chemical process independent of ideology. “But what about famines in the Soviet Union and China?”. Before the communists took power in China, China had a near constant state of famine in one region or another for over two thousand years. It wasn’t until the communists began the process of transforming the feudal, agrarian nation into a modern industrial nation that the famines stopped. Blaming the communists party for the conditions they inherited is like giving one person a normal house and another a burnt down house, and then say look how incompetent that one is. The party inherited one of the poorest countries in the world, and was given the task to modernize it. Was there poor action taken by the government that may have worsen the famine? Maybe, but the dark magic of communism didn’t prevent the plants from having cell growth, real life isn’t the lion king. Now for the Soviet Union. When the communists took power, most of the population was illiterate peasant farmers in the countryside who plowed with wooden plows and had no access to electricity or running water. Regions of the Russian empire had famines for centuries, it was not until the soviet put power that famine ended once and for all. The Bolsheviks had the task of modernizing the nation’s agricultural: introducing traitors to replace wooden plows, collectivizing small inefficient farms into large collective farms, etc. what happens happened in the Soviet Union? The civil war caused food storages, so did the Nazi invasion, because that is what war does. Then their was a famine in the 30s because poor weather conditions lead to insufficient crop growth. In every country with which communists have taken power there has been huge gains in quality of life. Large increases in life expectancy, the elimination of illiterate, women’s rights, etc"

spookyjohnathan,2020-01-05 20:52:16,fdbhsmt,t3_ek8p9v,t1_fd8eehr,"The capitalist system we have now is authoritarian. We live in a bourgeoisie dictatorship, where 1% of the population controls the government and economy, which is by definition more totalitarian than a dictatorship of the proletariat, where 99% are in charge.  Until everyone is united in one class all societies are dictatorships. A dictatorship where 99% control 1% is vastly superior to one where 1% control 99%."
TBTPlanet,2020-01-05 20:57:45,fdbj95a,t3_ek8p9v,t1_fdbfq1c,"I never claimed that communism itself caused famines, I claimed that authoritarian measures often associated with communism, such as the threat of execution if a quota was not met, can cause famine. Famines can have multiple causes. I never claimed that communist governments stop the physical and chemical changes in plants  which allow them to bear fruit. I instead have made the claim that the failure to distribute food as well as the overestimate and underproduction of food created by the authoritarian policies of Mao Zedong in the late 1950's caused the Great Chinese Famine, or at the very least exacerbated it. This is further demonstrated by the fact that although natural disasters were especially severe in China during that time period, China still possessed enough food to avoid the famines had the grain not been centralised. As to your second point, Stalin was able to (arguably) successfully industrialise a nation which had been corrupted and impoverished by the reign of a despotic monarchy. However, the authoritarian measures which he undertook cost millions of lives, such as forced agricultural collectivisation at a time when the agricultural situation in the country was already dire due to natural disasters. That leads to my ultimate question: Do communists believe that such measures are justified if they (in the leader's mind) create long-term prosperity?"
MarxistLeninism2050,2020-01-05 21:40:59,fdbqwla,t3_ek8p9v,t1_fdbj95a,"There is several things to go over here. According to you, economic planning is “authoritarian”. I fail to see the logic. So it is not authoritarian for a capitalist to hold determination how and what is produced in their privately owned industry, but it is authoritarian if for the government to determine what publicly owned industry does? I also disagree that agricultural collectivization made the famine worse. Collectivization was done in part because of the famine, to produce a more efficient agricultural system. You seem to be saying that medieval farms with wooden plows produce more then large farms with traitors."

In a planned economy, if one feels that the demands to produce a specific amount of a specific product are unfair, then one is shot. Seems like a significantly large disparity to me. In China, collectivisation occurred before the Great Famine, which is why it occurred. China had enough food during the years of the famine to avoid it entirely, but the ever-increasing quotas created by collectivisation coupled with threats of execution diverted food away from the rural areas where it was most needed. Also, I never claimed that medieval farms produce more than large, state-operated ones. I asked whether or not communists believe that creating arguably better state-operated farms at the cost of severe casualties is justifiable. I am not an advocate for the ruthless, despotic policies of the Russian Empire or Chiang Kai-shek's Republic of China. Stop putting words in my mouth."

Thus the policy is responsible for the reaction.  Or another is when you say ""social ownership of means of production has never killed anybody"" yea, its also never existed in the real modern world. Its a utopian fantasy and its the pursuit of it thats dangerous. I find it hard to believe that you wouldnt already understand the nature of right wing critiques of socialism.  Another is when you talk about food production while ignoring distribution (which is kind of the important thing) while also ignoring that the U.S.S.R was essentially in a state of perpetual famine.   And I guess finally is on the treatment of political dissidents.  Its impossible to deny the fear every person surrounding Stalin had for that man. They wouldnt even knock on his door.

So either way, they were starving the people.  &gt;...its also never existed in the real modern world.   I disagree. I think various levels of social control, even if not outright ownership, have existed and succeeded.

There's nothing idealistic about working for yourself on a means of production that isn't owned by a profiteer.  &gt;... its the pursuit of it thats dangerous.  Pursuing freedom is always dangerous, to those who stifle it. Escaping oppression is dangerous, for the oppressors. Self-defense is dangerous, for the aggressor.  When you say that building a socially owned means of production is dangerous, what you're saying is that those who profit from the working class having no choice but to work for them on their private means of production will fight to keep the working class from pursuing what is their right - to build a means of production for themselves so they can choose not to work for the capitalist profiteers.

They're not being punished because they disagree, they're being punished for violating the rights of workers. I've already covered all this.  I've also already explained why shouting from a soapbox while the government continues to ignore you isn't freedom.  &gt;Buddy you can split hairs all you like. This is diagusting.  It's the literal definition of capitalism, it's how the American economy functions, and it has nothing to do with the USSR.  &gt;I dont even agree with your definition of capitalism.  Then you don't know what capitalism is.  &gt;That its controlled by the elite for their own interests. Versus being controlled by the people.  Property controlled by the people isn't private property. It's public property. Public = people.  &gt;No. Its controlled by publically accountable parties.  I've already cited incontrovertible scientific evidence and statistical data that it isn't. Claiming otherwise without evidence changes absolutely nothing.  &gt;We choose the direction of our economy.  You don't choose shit. I've already demonstrated why.  &gt;Unlike the soviet union which has a written law stating that right wing capitalist and left wing anarchists anrent allowed to participate.  Source your claims.  &gt;With a highly objectionable method?  It's not.  &gt;Of course only the elites ideas have any influence. Average people would rather listen to a scientist or person with experience in banking policy proposals.   The ""elites"" are not scientists. They're the owner class. Capitalists.  And no, you're missing the point, or at least you would be if you weren't being willfully ignorant of it. The people aren't merely ""listening"" to them. Ideas and policies the people support are disregarded. This shows the people already want different policies, and despite popular support for those policies, they aren't adopted. Your government doesn't belong to you. It belongs to the rich. The US is a bourgeoisie dictatorship. It always has been.  &gt;Look at Obama foreigns policy. He literally flipped it 300 and 60 degrees.  Obama was a neoliberal capitalist. His Predecessor was a neoconservative capitalist. His predecessor was a neoliberal capitalist. His predecessor was a neoconservative capitalist. His predecessor was a neoliberal capitalist. His predecessor was a neoliberal capitalist. His predecessor was a conservative capitalist. His predecessor was a conservative capitalist.  Nothing is flipping. Your narrative is so limited and your understanding so closed minded that you consider twin branches of the same ideology as being diametrically opposed. Neoliberal capitalism is not 360 degrees from neoconservative capitalism."

That's the biggest reason why I'm very reluctant to call people in your situation class traitors (meaning socialists suddenly finding themselves in ultra-capitalist circumstances). If it's not you, it's someone else who probably gives little to no shit about the tenants.  More specifically what you could do is try to be as reasonable as you possibly can. Since you claim to be in debt, the money will be of use to you, and I doubt you'd sit on it hoarding it. However, when you're debt-free and live off a decent income, you could consider lowering the rent for your future tenants (or at least not unreasonably increasing them), prioritizing society's marginalized people searching for housing, or overall just making the entire experience better than many landlords that crack down on the tenants."

Comrade as a French what advice I could give you is to rent it, here we have a huge problem with unrent empty building when there are plenty of homeless people and it is a shame, especially in this cold time.  What would be my best advice is to find a poor family or people who don't have the usual requirement to have access to housing, and rent them. This way you will at least help people who are in need. Just be sure to find someone who deserve it, especially if you take the risk for them. And do it only if your own income don't depend of this rent, but I guess it doesn't ?  For real, housing become a problem for a lot of people, especially the younger people who don't have enough guarantee to afford a housing. There are too much people working and sleeping in their cars because of some formality bullshit.

That's not because I think the situation will be better if somebody else is renting it out, but because I realize that objective reality determines consciousness and I would rather maintain as proletarian a lifestyle as possible for that reason.  Additionally, we should account for the fact that the bourgeoisie in Engels's time, and particularly in a relatively backward nation like Germany, was much closer to a period in which it still had a progressive role to play. Marx and Engels lived through, and participated in, the bourgeois-democratic revolutions of 1848. That being said, I certainly don't think you'll automatically be a bad person if you rent it out."

By the way, I'll eventually be in the same boat you are on, my mother is a landlady (it's inheritance going three generations back).   Be respectful of your tenants, do keep the place up to standards and be kind.

I would keep the property, rent it at Cost Plus your time, preferentially to people who really need it, and be super clear about everything. Give monthly statements about your expenses for renting the property, explanations about local laws and how they apply, and push your tenants to be involved locally. Make a very public pool for upgrading the playground or whatever. When considering whether to subscribe to lawn maintenance or snow shoveling involve the tenants and allow them to decide collectively to pay or handle it themselves. Have them ""employ"" local children with General cleanup, and inform everyone of local government votes that would bear on the situation."

Being a landlord isn't that great of a financial investment. Contrary to popular belief here, being a landlord is usually not a great return on your money compared to the opportunity costs of what you can be doing with it otherwise. There are obvious exceptions depending on various market conditions, but for the most part it's a profitable investment with modest returns and a large assumed risk. On a time scale of decades being a landlord can grow a big portfolio... But so can dumping money into mutual funds every month.   There is advice on this post about renting it below market price to someone else who might need it - this might be good advice for anyone you can personally vet, but if you are going through a third part to find a renter? It won't be a good idea. Lets say someone rents the unit, does some sort of large damage to it, and you are left with the bill? Where is this money going to be drawn from?  More importantly even for unintentional damages, these can add up quickly. Appliances, plumbing bills, a major electrical issue? All of these have huge costs that can eat up multiple months worth of rent and drop you in the hole.   What you should be doing is finding a way to sell the unit you inherited and find some other way to use the money, or you should approach being a landlord in a way that is conducive to your values without putting you at financial risk. Part of the reason a number of landlords are aggressive to tenants is for the above risk/reward reasons, and just being an understanding, human landlord goes a long, long way. If your tenant does fall ill and needed to take a few weeks off work? Just deferring until they can pay it (or forgiving) that months rent already puts you in the top .1% of dope landlords. There are ways to be both a landlord and not a heartless monster... But just remember, these people also exist in a capitalist system in which you can be taken advantage of.   My advice would be that you should just sell the property and put it in some other investment."

spookyjohnathan,2020-01-08 01:07:41,fdiln4w,t3_elfiyz,t3_elfiyz,"&gt;...see socialism as as necessary a part of government as the capitalism it shares a democracy with.  Socialism is not when the government does stuff.  [Socialism is social ownership of the means of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism) so that the workers can use it [to work for themselves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_each_according_to_his_contribution) instead of having no other choice but to work for the capitalist class on their privately owned means of production.  These things cannot co-exist. If the workers have the choice to work for themselves on a socially owned means of production and keep the fruit of their labor to themselves, they would never choose to work for someone else and share their labor with them. If the workers had a choice, capitalism would fall apart, which is why it's so [important to capitalists to make sure that we can never build that means of production for ourselves.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_involvement_in_regime_change#1945%E2%80%931991:_The_Cold_War)  The conditions for socialism don't exist anywhere in the United States, neither in secluded enclaves nor as part of the US government. No where in the United States does the working class have the power to work for themselves and keep the fruit of their labor for themselves on a socially owned means of production.  Worker co-ops are the closest thing in the US, and while they may be better than traditional capitalist enterprises, they are not socialist; they're still private property functioning to create profit for its owners within a capitalist framework.  And obviously co-ops play no role in government, let alone a necessary one.  Nationalization of some services is a policy that socialists tend to agree with, but in the US it does not serve the purpose of allowing the workers of nationalized industries democratic control of their workplace, or the ability to work for themselves. They're still expected to generate profit for the owners of the nationalized service.  In other words, the US government is not in any way, shape or form socialist, in part or in whole, and no policy used by the US government has anything to do with social ownership of the means of production.  &gt; US and USSR prisons came up and one commenter said he believed that US prisons at peak were larger a population proportion than gulags.  This is not wrong. The US imprisons a larger portion of her population [than any other society in history.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_United_States_incarceration_rate_with_other_countries) At it's peak the population in [the gulag system was about 1.5 million of the USSR's 168 million population, or about .8 per 100, and it rapidly decreased from that point.](https://books.google.com/books?id=8fIfmxAs_T0C&amp;pg=PA446&amp;lpg=PA446&amp;dq=gulag+total+population#v=onepage&amp;q=gulag%20total%20population&amp;f=false) The US imprisons about [1 in 100 and remains strong.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_United_States_incarceration_rate_with_other_countries#U.S._incarceration_rate_peaked_in_2008)  &gt;[...there’s something to be said for mortality rates.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateCommunism/comments/elfiyz/do_people_here_believe_american_prisons_can_be/fdhp7bf/)  [Ill prisoners were regularly released from gulag to receive medical attention, and the overwhelming majority of prisoners served their time and were released. Gulag was not a life sentence, and there's absolutely no historical evidence that the gulag system was uniquely destructive to the inmate population in any capacity, let alone compared to similar systems at the time.](https://www.deepdyve.com/lp/ou_press/golfo-alexopoulos-illness-and-inhumanity-in-stalin-s-gulag-i363rKPYOp)  &gt;...it also ignores the severity of the two systems.  There was nothing particularly unheard of in the gulag system. Work camps were [common all over the world at that time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_camp) and are still part of the official policy of many countries to this day - [including the US.](https://web.archive.org/web/20030403135807/http://www.army.mil/usapa/epubs/pdf/r210_35.pdf) They were not some unique evil invented in the USSR. In fact, the USSR didn't even invent their own gulag system - [it was the prison system they inherited from the Tsars.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulag#History) The Soviets' chief contribution was the name, [which was taken from the agency that took over the camps in the new government.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulag#Contemporary_word_usage_and_other_terminology)  As for comparing the modern US prison system to the prison system of the USSR in the 20s, 30s, and 40s, that would be exceedingly disingenuous. Both systems had long been considered inhumane (although again I stress, not uniquely so) and were modernized and reformed at about the same time during the 50s. [Penal labor was very common in the US up to that point, and remains so today in various forms.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_labor_in_the_United_States) Prison camps and political exile fell out of favor in the USSR about [the same time the US started phasing out the infamous chain gangs,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_labor_in_the_United_States) although it's worth noting that some US states have tried to [reintroduce chain gangs; of those attempts that have failed, they did so not because of their inhumanity, but because chain gangs aren't profitable enough.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_gang#Reintroduction)  At the end of the day the gulag system was just another penal labor system. Inhuman and barbaric, but not uniquely so. It should be considered a failure of the Soviets to reform the prison system they inherited, not a new horror invented by communism.  In time however the camps were reformed and the prison system in the USSR was modernized, and nowadays most Communists, even many Marxist-Leninists, are opposed to punitive penal correction and we denounce it. We prefer education about the harm caused by liberal and reactionary thought, skill and job training programs, and therapy for criminals."

Your response to the comparison of penal systems really clicked for me in a way that other ""cross examinations"" of communism v capitalism havent. At first I didn't know why, but I think I figured it out. Its that you admitted fault. You admitted that the Gulags were a barbaric thing of the past, and stated the modern marxist belief of being anti-penal program and pro-reeducation. The reason this clicked while other types of cross-examinations haven't is because normally we're talking modern US vs modern China etc.. Saying ""yes the USSR had an immoral penal system, but so did the US, and they both modernized at the same time, and today us Marxists have moved past penal systems and denounce them"" is much different than saying ""Yes, China has billionaires, but its okay because they're contributing to the necessary forces of historical materialism that will lead to communist revolution, and besides, we have less than the US"". Like the former is a genuine analysis of the shortcomings of both systems, while the latter is just excuses that don't work for me personally. Like no, its not okay that you have billionaires or a booming capitalist sector and are allowing the outsourcing of sweatshops to enrich American capitalists."

Before all else it covers the least concerning times for the Gulags, post war and even post 1952,1953 and 1954 which all by all sources see massive improvements to gulag conditions especially after Beriya was executed, it all is pretty conflated. It also has a limited scope.  First on the conditions as per the source used by the Greenville post  we see clearly in humane conditions including the alleged practice of killing prisoners for money and holidays.  Second the pay was a farce, for by default a minimum of 60% belonged to the camp and the example given prices of other deductions are over the normal payment received which by what I can see came to a base rate of 30-50 of modern American dollars a month before deduction.  The second section is wildly off, the idea that the soviets has more than 2% of their population in prison is higher than I had previously believed and that the US has millions in prison before 2000 is counter to the bureau of justice statistics which puts it under 1.2 million. US prisons never got over 1% by any significant number if they did.  I can’t look at anything in that and look favourably at the gulags even in the safest period as presented.  US prisons have grown far out of what can be justified but are nothing to compare by what you’ve presented and still seem inaccurately presented as having bigger portions of the American population than Gulags did."

periodicchemistrypun,2020-01-08 06:36:25,fdjcm50,t3_elfiyz,t1_fdiln4w,"Thanks for the most detailed and interesting answer so far.  As for my politics I am not American, I’ve walked out of many hospitals without so much as showing an identity card and would consider that socialised healthcare and the same as to roads, transport and various other services and those not being ‘the means of production’ seems arbitrary to me. And I do mean politics, close enough to our party’s communist faction to call them comrade without seeming like in making fun of them but far enough that it’s not what they say back.  However I’ve gone over the numbers many times and and that’s a .89% gulag rate you present which is low by other estimations of gulags, I’ve found numbers over 2% in defence of the idea that the US has had a larger prison population. This seems to be largely about classifying gulag populations which could defensibly put the number much higher.  However your pew research source cites the bureau of statistics which does not say 1 in 100 but rather closer to half a percent than a percent, 0.6% in 2008 because it specifies adults, finding further detail is time consuming but the direct comparison is clear.  I can’t get your source from deepdyve working for me.  That said on the uniqueness of the gulags it misses the original point of discussion that the comparison is made between the American prison system and the gulags which in 1939 was 0.14% of the population and so fractionally less significant certainly in numbers and as we have discussed at both their peaks the US prison as I have seen in research inarguably have yet to proportionally eclipse gulags in population and debatably have not eclipsed them in raw numbers yet.  Probably the fairer comparisons would include internment camps and a couple other practices in the US not included in the term ‘prison’ but that wouldn’t change what I just said.  It’s interesting what you say for the communist view on prisons, I appreciate the context.  To the severity of gulags surely you’d agree the anachronism of the direct comparison would intuitively lead you to believe the gulags crueler, less well supplied and farther from government concern than any modern comparison and clearly any comparison to the worst forced labor camps of the era is unjust given the death camps that share the era.  But the gulags sit unique largely for their role in the power of communism as a whole and that would stand as your point in my eyes if I discredited the communist power especially for its initiative given that gulags appear and gain in significance before the outbreak of WW2.  I was going to say is there any greater example of post war forced labor camps but wow in reading up a bit on that it’s a can of worms I don’t want to get into, the post WW2 German labor one was enough to see that I’d be wrong to ask.  Ultimately I still can’t see gulags yet as being less significant than the US prison system for all I’ve learnt."

My own great-grandfather was sent off to Siberia because Soviet army officers found his draft notice to the Hungarian army even though he dodged it.

The number of inmates was much lower than Cold War-era scholars often claimed, and the vast majority of prisoners were non-political. According to Professor [J. Arch Getty](https://history.ucla.edu/faculty/j-arch-getty)'s article in the *American Historical Review:*  &gt;The long-awaited archival evidence on repression in the period of the Great Purges shows that the levels of arrests, political prisoners, executions, and general camp populations tend to confirm the orders of magnitude indicated by those labeled as ""revisionists"" and mocked by those proposing high estimates... inferences that the terror fell particularly hard on non-Russian nationalities are not borne out by the camp population data from the 1930's. The frequent assertion that most of the camp prisoners were 'political' also seems not to be true.  Between 12 and 33 percent (depending on the year) of gulag inmates were convicted of ""counterrevolutionary crimes,"" with the rest being ordinary criminals (thieves, murderers, rapists, and others). Also, the gulags were not death camps like those of the Nazis; they were prisons, albeit harsh ones. Even noted anti-communist scholars (such as those who worked on the infamous *Black Book of Communism*) have admitted this. To quote again from Professor Getty (this time in the *Atlantic*):  &gt;Stalin's camps were different from Hitler's. Tens of thousands of prisoners were released every year upon completion of their sentences. We now know that before World War II more inmates escaped annually from the Soviet camps than died there. \[...\] Werth, a well-regarded French specialist on the Soviet Union whose sections in the *Black Book* on the Soviet Communists are sober and damning, told *Le Monde,* ""Death camps did not exist in the Soviet Union.""  It is also true that the United States has the highest number of prisoners in the world, in both absolute and relative (per-capita) terms. As mentioned by another commentor, about half of these prisoners are pre-trial, meaning that they have not yet been convicted of any crimes at all.  In short, while gulags were harsh places (and one certainly wanted to avoid being sent there), they were not death camps, nor were they primarily political in nature. They were prisons, which housed genuine criminals, and where the vast majority of inmates were released upon completion of their sentences.  **Sources**  * [American Historical Review | Victims of the Soviet Penal System in the Pre-War Years: A First Approach on the Basis of Archival Evidence](http://sovietinfo.tripod.com/GTY-Penal_System.pdf) * [The Atlantic | The Future Did Not Work](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2000/03/the-future-did-not-work/378081/)"

You will need to provide clear and non cherry-picked evidence that the claims which you are disputing have been sourced from Western governments who intently and purposefully lie/exaggerate the misdeeds of a collectivist economy. I am not claiming that Western governments cannot lie and WTO governments do not tell the truth, but, as this is a far too common argument often used to throw aside well-documented and well-researched evidence, I would like more information on this. 2. I was not commenting on the Soviet system, but the Chinese one (though the USSR did things similar in nature), so I apologize for the lack of clarity. 3. This is a perfect example of the ""whataboutism"" which I encounter so frequently on Reddit. Just because capitalism has led to some horrible crimes in the past does not dismiss my arguments against a collectivist economy. I do support government interference in ""leveling the playing field"" in a market economy, which means strengthening labour unions and ensuring that these things never happen again. That being said, the Soviet Union, which claimed to be a ""dictatorship of the proletariat"" not only outlawed strikes, but even fired upon them, such as in 1962.  4. The quote  ""When there is not enough to eat people starve to death. It is better to let half of the people die so that the other half can eat their fill."" which was uttered by Mao Zedong in 1959 as he planned to divert food away from rural China very much sums up my hostility towards a collectivised economy."

Marxism does not really deal in hypotheticals; we are interested in objective material realities.

If this is what you mean by ""self-managed,"" then it's extremely unrealistic.  However, if by ""self-managed"" you mean ""owned and managed by those who work in it,"" then this is simply a different form of socialism. The workers collectively own and manage the factory.

In retrospect, when we look back at times when it seemed in place and inevitable, it was shakey. The English Civil War and French Revolution we’re both folded back and beaten down. We know now that the damage was done and can see what happened, but if you grew up in either of the restorations the idea that you were going to go back to feudalism would have seemed possible and the republican experiment being an American novelty that failed within a decade would seem downright likely.   In hindsight this period of time is almost invisible though. The match of history goes on.  2. Related and more direct to the question, at the moment it seems that socialism has stalled because it didn’t internationalize (same as the bourgeois revolutions above). Marx, Engels, and Lenin (among others) all expected a global revolution in one form of another. And they were wrong to do that. Germany, France, Ireland, Spain, Hungary, just about every country in Europe had a communist revolution in one way or another during or just after the Russian Revolution.  China, Vietnam, Central and South America, Africa, the Islamic World, it was (is?) a movement that went global.  We can (and do) nitpick about the utility of what should have been done when Germany and other big countries didn’t fall quickly. But in the broad spoke of history, the global movement cements the revolution.  It may have seemed to have failed now...as did capitalism, feudalism, and every other system that developed.   As for the West today, just remember the most backward, religious, rightwing and restrictive system in Europe ended up leading the communist revolution in a completely unforeseen way. We can’t count on this though, so we must study, organize, write, build, unionize, and spread the world. We have nothing to lose, after all."

Workers’ Parties will always lead to a form of class division growing between the upper echelons of the party and the proletariat, unless so much power is stripped from the Party and given to the people that the Party becomes obsolete.

You may think it's debatable whether it's justifiable to do so, but it's not even necessary, and the result is the same for the bourgeoisie one way or the other.  Our goal, and our right, is to build a socially owned means of production for the working class to use to work for themselves. It's our right because the public has the right to use public resources to build something for themselves, including a means of production so they can work for themselves, just like we build public education to educate ourselves and security and defense to defend ourselves.  If the workers have the choice to work for themselves on the socially owned means of production and keep the fruit of their labor to themselves, they'll never have a reason to choose to work for a capitalist on his private means of production and share their labor with him.  The end result, one way or the other, is that the capitalist will go out of business and his formerly private means of production will be redistributed.  No one's going to work for capitalists when they can choose to work for themselves.  Now, capitalists might use their privately owned means of production to work for themselves, and that's fine; after the revolution, socialism doesn't have a lot to say about petit bourgeoisie and personally I don't think many people care. The goal is to create a means of production for all the people who don't have a choice, not to take your means of production away from you."

It must be pointed out that the 'actual seizure' of all the instruments of labor, the taking possession of industry as a whole by the working people, is the exact opposite of the Proudhonist 'redemption'. In the latter case the individual worker becomes the owner of the dwelling, the peasant farm, the instruments of labor; in the former case, the 'working people' remain the collective owners of the houses, factories and instruments of labor, and will hardly permit their use, at least during a transitional period, by individuals or associations without compensation for the cost. In the same way, the abolition of property in land is not the abolition of ground rent but its transfer, if in a modified form, to society.

AriAncom,2020-01-09 21:15:16,fdog87v,t3_em5ewl,t1_fdnhmyc,"If you’re able, you should have a read of The Conquest Of Bread by Peter Kropotkin (the title of which is where words such as “breadtube” and “breadpill” come from. The Ebook is free at most Ebook stores, and the audiobook is free from LibriVox). Kropotkin argues that in the event of a revolution, the most important goal (in joint with putting down the ruling class and their dogs) is to guarantee the means of comfortable living for the revolutionaries. This means that the bakeries (hence “conquest of bread”), the looms, the farms, the butchers, the mills, must all be liberated and immediately be given to community ownership that none will go hungry as the revolution wages, and the communal (not state) ownership of the means of production and all that is produced must continue from the start of the revolution, to the establishment of a communist society, and beyond.   I can’t remember if Kropotkin mentions this, but many people agree that the best way to shape society would be for everyone to sort themselves into communes of 100-500 people, who then collectively own their local means of production and share what they don’t need with their neighbours and the rest of society. Each commune would manage its own militia, who would also manage disaster response, and collaborate with other militias in times of crisis. Each commune would be managed through direct democracy, and send delegates (not to be confused with representatives in the current sense) to regional assemblies when necessary, who would send delegates to continental assemblies, etc.. There would also likely be smaller councils on various scales to address the concerns of various minorities, in case of oppression.  I hope that this has answered your question satisfactorily"
doubledead22,2020-01-09 21:29:34,fdohpun,t3_em5ewl,t1_fdog87v,"I’ve heard of him and I can’t say I’ve read much of his work. All I know is “read the bread book” lol  The model described sounds like it would eventually fall apart on large scales though. The various communes would contain diverging political lines or no political lines at all, so no eventual goal for society will be set. What if militias can’t be raised? What if a commune with no militia gets raided by another commune, who will step in to stop it?  This reminds me of the anarchist model in Spain during the civil war. At the beginning the various workers councils and factories were disorganized and often would end up producing too much of something because the other factory 4 miles away would make the same commodity, there wasn’t communication at times between the collectives, and sometimes workers of a factory wouldn’t care about anything beyond the factory, their workplaces are what mattered. In such a situation, some kind of centralized organs needs to be present to help organize everything.   Workers councils are great on small scales, but they work even better with a state."
AriAncom,2020-01-09 23:04:43,fdor7xw,t3_em5ewl,t1_fdohpun,"The point is that the councils on the larger scales would replace states, and provide the organisation you’re talking about. To a great degree modern technology will also greatly facilitate such organisation, and unions among similar workplaces will also facilitate cooperation and organisation between workplaces to make sure that work is equally distributed and not over-or-underproducing. Saying that Catalonia didn’t work so council communism wouldn’t work is like saying that the USSR collapsed so state communism wouldn’t work. Mistakes were made, but those are mistakes we can learn from  In regards to your problems with militias, if a commune democratically decides to not have a militia it’s their choice, but they’d likely be pressured to provide some other service to replace it, such as a hospital, or a detainment and treatment facility for people who are unable to safely interact with society. And why would one commune attack another? They’d be able to get anything they need just by asking, and proper education would counter the possibility of bigoted violence. And even if one commune did attack another, there’d be immediately embargoed by the rest of society, and the commune would likely be broken up, the members distributed to many other communes, and the instigators would be assessed for any further danger to society. I can’t see inter-communal violence being treated lightly   And the whole scale argument is rubbish, what do you even consider small scale? 100? 1,000? 10,000? 100,000? 1,000,000? Where does the idea begin to break down? Why does it break down there and not before or after? It’s exactly the same as the bourgeoisie argument that communism as a whole is a nice idea on small scales and becomes totalitarian if it’s implemented on a larger scale, except that you’re substituting totalitarianism for state communism. It doesn’t actually mean anything and the only evidence supporting it is that previous attempts made mistakes"

The anarchists became more efficient as they centralized, as evident by many workers who began to complain later on that the CNT acted more like a state in itself and it became almost impossible to voice concerns to the elected administrators.   “Why would one commune attack the other?” Because conflict is inevitable, doesn’t matter how cheerful our slogans are my guy. The actions in case such a thing were to happen would be mediated by a central force which would decide what to do with the perpetrators, investigate, aid victims. A state.  The “rubbish” of the large scale argument was fixed when anarchists began consolidating their councils into state-like organs."

Are you really claiming that lack of accountability for elected officials is a good thing?? Wtf??   That’s a really depressing view of humanity. I’d argue that conflict is only inevitable where patriotism, bigotry, or unmet needs exist, which are all things that a communist society should avoid as a priority.

Well, we would have to look at individual cases, unique material conditions, resources, but I believe the number of communes isn’t the right question, it’s the number of councils/communes and their diverging political lines and the lack of a singular goal for society holding everything together.  For example, say we have 10 workers’ councils operating but they are all working and producing under a single party line. Things would run smoothly here, in theory. Everyone is on the same page.  Now say you have 10 workers’ councils with 10 different political lines, but on top of that inside the councils the workers themselves have various ideologies or no ideologies at all. That one would seem extra tricky. Now imagine 100 councils with diverging political lines. Now 1000. 10000.  That is the case of the early anarchist experiments during the civil war. Over time they realized they had to consolidate power. My point is we all need the state in one way or another after the revolution, it works."

I think one of the goals of the new society especially with our current material conditions is to make the most people free possible or were doomed to failure.

A planned economy would try to determine the optimal form of automation, which would both increase living standards and prevent too rapid a shift in employment.  &gt;Why can no non state-funded competition exist in a socialist society?  I've already explained why socialists are opposed to the notion of private ownership of the means of production. However, *cooperative* ownership can (and often has) existed in socialist societies. While cooperative enterprises often work in tandem with the state, they do not necessarily have to be owned by it. As I mentioned before, the Soviet constitution allowed two forms of ""socialist ownership,"" those being state ownership and cooperative (or ""collective"") ownership."

As you point out there are ways to temporarily have a higher rate of profit, but so long as theres competition that rate of profit will be in decline. My point is purely pedantic, because theres no way for capitalism to avoid the tendency, it's always there, just temporarily overshadowed by other factors  This is just another example of contradictions in capitalism. Contradictions go the way they do, the constant antagonism between competing interests create waves in society one way or another, and when the waves reach a certain height you end up with revolution. It's unlikely that society could ever get to a point where the steady slow fall in profits is what singularly causes the end of capitalism simply because fascism and ecological collapse will get us first.  As profit rates fall and get gobbled up my monopolies businesses will get even more desperate for bucks, more antagonisms between workers and bosses, more workers overworked, more jobs cut, more homelessness, more mental illness, more desperation."

However, as ownership is distributed the needs of the ownership (the workers) is made more complex. Alongside profit, the owners would be concerned for their quality of life and work. The desire for an enjoyable engagement with work should act as a countervailing desire to the profit motive.  And in the end, an increase in profit is at least distributed more widely than the hand of a single private owner or board of directors. On the other hand, should profit fall, coops tend to be more resilient than private concerns, and can more readily share in the decrease of wealth by way of wage/salary cuts instead of layoffs.

The few people who had their heads not up their asses and correctly assessed the situation, like [this guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Burry), and went so far as to bet huge sums against the housing market, ended up making a metric fuckton of money when shit hit the fan. The fund he managed made something on the order of 400% while the rest of the market disintegrated. He had actually done something similar in 2000 to profit off the bursting of the Dot Com bubble as well, just not on this kind of scale.  It really didn't have anything to do with ""contradictions in capitalism"" -- people sometimes hold incredibly irrational expectations, and if they all act on those expectations in concert, even mainstream theory predicts that many prophecies can be at least temporarily self-fulfilling -- until, of course, the expectations wear off at some point, or the real limitations of the market's short-run finiteness begin to set in.

So long as we wish for society to continue existing, even if all profits were eradicated, we will continue to consume resources at a likely increasing rate corresponding with the rate of population increase. These resources will eventually deplete, capitalism or not. Even if we extend our horizons to huge time scales to allow for natural resource recycling, we still have the problem of the 2nd law of thermodynamics working against us.  Whether this place is a country or a planet or a solar system or a galaxy, this will always be true. It's called scarcity.  In order for *any* economic system to survive it must continually seek out and consume more resources. Capitalism involving profit does not change anything. The amount of resources we use might increase faster than under a communist or socialist system since there is greater incentive to expend the effort to acquire them if you stand to personally gain a lot from doing so. But unless your plan is to cull the population or even bring it to extinction, we always will need more resources. For what I care, having stuff is better than not having stuff, so I'd like as much of it as possible; hence I'm in favor of the market system.  As others have said, as well, there is a natural tendency of markets to squeeze profits out. The knowledge that there is profit in an industry is an invitation for a new firm to enter that market and take some of that profit off the table. More firms in the industry = lower prices on the things they produce = lower profit for all firms involved (generally, anyway -- issues like oligopoly or oligopsony \[I use these terms because there are very few true monopolies and monopsonies\] might confound this process and permit sustained profit). It's got nothing to do with the proportion of capital to labor, either -- it has to do with the natural market process, regardless of the state of technology or the involvement of capital in production.  Profit doesn't come from labor anyway. Profit is a coincidence of market equilibrium prices which work out favorably to the productive firm. Labor is one market; the widget market is virtually completely separate. If labor receives some equilibrium wage L, capital is bought at some equilibrium price C, and the widgets sell for some equilibrium price W, profit is simply when W &gt; L + C for whatever reason. That profit didn't originate in any single point in the production process. It just exists."
periodicchemistrypun,2020-01-12 13:04:48,fe244j5,t3_elfiyz,t1_fdkllns,"Sorry for the slow reply but I’ve slowed down on this thread because the whole subject is absolutely draining.  There isn’t a neutral opinion on gulags and there’s a lot of discussion on sources, some that feels bloody pointless nit picking.  If we exclude death camps for contemporary comparison because I’m not calling a gulag that bad then I’d find calling gulags amongst the more human forced labor camps a grand but not dismissible claim.  The gulags seemed to have three periods in most sources being worst during WW2 and then best afterwards with some sources saying the total death rate sits at 10% with a range from 25-1%.  That said a 1% death rate is 4-5 times Australian death rates. https://www.crimestats.aic.gov.au/NDICP/  And 4 times higher than American prisons https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/msp0114st.pdf  So I feel validated in my view that gulags are worse than American prisons are now even to compare to your number which is by what I’ve read a low figure.  Here’s a detailed image that still increases your numbers.  https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/bkaq89/evidence_the_gulags_werent_death_camps/  Some here have said the gulags inherited issues from the tsarist system. Maybe.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_prisoners_of_war_in_the_United_Kingdom  Labor camps are very varied but you would have to expect POW camps to be more dangerous than civilian camps. The British camps are phenomenally safe by comparison, obviously distance reduced the chance of injury killing a solider late.  I think it’s very difficult to directly compare conditions as all are subject to lies and exaggerations in both direction."
Mai4eeze,2020-01-12 14:56:34,fe2nwyf,t3_elfiyz,t1_fe244j5,"I also want to note that during WW2 people in USSR were dying in millions yearly, so comparing gulags of that time period to modern prisons is quite pointless. Same goes for averaging over the whole soviet period. But year, it seems like gulags weren't *better* than modern prisons, just not as much worse as people imagine.  &gt; Some here have said the gulags inherited issues from the tsarist system.  I don't think that could be it. The Russian Empire legislation was completely dismantled in 1917, I doubt that kind of remnant of the past could survive decades after. Can you link me to that discussion please?"

One thing was over-production in a market that has become narrow. The market had tons of houses but no one could pay for them. The contradiction led to an excess and a crash.  The government for sure had its hand in this, the Us state/gov is wont to fuck its citizens over in the aid of capitalism and banks.   Very interesting stuff about that guy. Thanks for the link."

doubledead22,2020-01-12 19:03:22,fe44wdi,t3_enfxyp,t1_fe1dd7d,"“profit doesn’t come from labor”  Labor theory of value debunked, checkmate. But seriously the last point is so subtle you might miss it. Marx liked talking about surplus-value, because he was coming from a certain angle in writing Capital, but really profit is surplus value plus commodities sold. The whole transformation problem is something I’m still sorting through. Either you can say it’s not important or it’s kinda true but the equations need some fixing."

Needless to say, he is no longer my friend.

I thought capitalism just had a simple definition, namely the means of production being owned privately, and usually the word also is shorthand for ""free market capitalism"" in which voluntary, relatively decentralized trading of goods and services via the medium of currency is relatively uninhibited.  Your claim is just unsupported propaganda against capitalism."

Meanwhile I research for all my comments even if that is not a necessary practice for a good debate and I’m getting people like you turning your nose up because your rejecting the idea you don’t already believe.

CrimsonQueen9,2020-01-14 03:59:33,fechzgp,t3_emjxyg,t1_fdqomc5,"Sure, lies around it are guaranteed. However, we know from accounts of people who were imprisoned in Gulags that the scale was quite extreme. 95% might have been mainstream criminals at some point after 1953, but there was a large percentage of political prisoners beforehand. Furthermore, there is some NKVD documents that point to the scale of the operation. I do not think that so many people deserved to be sent to Gulags. There were excesses with the entire operation, as there were extreme excesses in the great purge.  It does seem that the living standards, while very poor, were not such that the Gulag led to the deaths of millions. The massive death toll seems to be largely a result of the WW2 and post WW2 famines that of course severely effected gulags."
