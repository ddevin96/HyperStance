I also find the whole ""a fetus is a life"" argument kind of hypocritical. A chicken egg would have been a life, had a farmer not taken it and sold it. You are literally eating a potential life.

The unborn are innocent [human beings](http://blog.secularprolife.org/2017/08/a-zygote-is-human-being.html?m=1), which is why we think it’s wrong to kill them.  2.

Displays cells contain the full genetic code necessary to develop along to predictable developmental path of Homo sapiens. A gamete has the same DNA as the respective parents while the zygote has its own unique DNA separate from its parents. This is why the zygote stage is considered the beginning of human development and not the gamete stage.

There is a basic **human** right to life.  Fertilized human eggs (aka, zygotes) are human organisms. By all scientific standards, they are living humans. As a fetus (approx. 8+ weeks of gestation), they have all major organs formed, yes including a brain. Is the brain fully developed? Of course not, nobody's brain is fully developed until they reach their 20's. A newborn baby obviously is less developed than an adult, and yet still has basic human rights.  So the question u/SoupSamich, is what metric can be rationally applied to an unborn living human, to deprive it of human rights, without depriving *other* living humans?

Human rights are just laws, which we created, which we decided wouldn't apply to (all of) the unborn, just like we've done with hundreds of other laws with different groups of people.

I don't think being human should really factor in at all.  I think humanity should cross that bridge when we get to it, although I'm sure there'd be plenty of ethical questions to explore there. Regardless, excluding the possibility of non-human beings getting human rights, in no other case do we deny human rights to humans except with the unborn. This is why I feel it's up to the pro-choicer to explain what the relevant distinction is.  They are indeed merely laws, but laws have been wrong countless times in the past and I think this is a law worth looking back into, particularly as our knowledge of fetal development continues to grow over the decades.  To put it another way, in every past instance of people denying personhood to a member of the human species, it's been someone in power denying it to someone with less power--specifically for the former to gain even more of an advantage. And incidentally, every one of these instances in human history have been later agreed-upon as morally wrong. What makes us right in this case?"

It is my belief that the major divide between pro-life and pro-choice is whether human rights exist. If they do, all living humans must have them. If they don't, then societies can determine for themselves what is useful and nonuseful, including homicide (and yes, it sounds bad, but capital punishment and self-defense are commonly accepted forms of homicide).  Personally, I think that's terrible, because of historical reasons. The justifications for most genocides, chattel slavery, eugenics, and other evils were perpetuated because of philosophies very similar to these (aka, society would benefit from these acts; or ""the end justifies the means""). Without a moral foundation in *inherent* qualities, societies have free reign to commit atrocities in the name of popular consensus."

Hollywood seems to like their starlets young and nuliparas so it makes sense that if you are pro-life to keep your pretty mouth shut until after you have enough status that they cannot knock you down.  For example suspect Angelina Jolie is prolife she has a bunch of kids and lots of her kids are adopted from prolife nations, prochoice culture wouldn't have let her kids to exist, so she cannot wish her kids wouldn't exist. I might be wrong, but she has the perfect profile of a closeted prolife. Time will tell if she will be willing to stand for the cause or not."

Birth Control can actually change who the woman is attracted to, plus trades off risk of some types of cancer for risk in other types of cancer.

Coupling that with the knowledge that the pill can prevent implantation after fertilization (the point at which a new human life is created), I'm not a fan of those options. Otherwise I don't have an issue with birth control.  2. I am pro life because I believe the unborn are human beings from the moment of conception and that every human has the inherent, unalienable right to life. The situation may be tough, but I believe that a temporary sacrifice on the part of the mother is preferable to killing an innocent person."

Milton_Price19,2020-01-11 04:35:40,fdtiqgm,t3_en2bku,t3_en2bku,"Birth control is one way to minimize the chance if pregnancy on the woman, and this is one reason I find i.t to be a responsible choice. If a woman does not get pregnant, then there is no question of abortion. Condoms also fall under the birth control umbrella. Prevention of pregnancy isn't the same as termination.   I take a pro-life stance on all issues. I value all life, so, to me, even the death penalty seems excessive. I agree with one of the other commenters here too: ""you can't kill someone for growing inside you."" We cannot arbitrarily set a time when a child becomes a child, since fetal development is a process. Because it's a process, even the moment of conception must be considered as the moment of life. This life inside the mother depends on her nurturing well after the birthing, and so, by extension, we also cannot assume nurturing and protection of the fetus only starts at birth, but also starts in the womb. Logically speaking, abortion is infanticide.  I also believe that abortion contradicts the feminist philosophy. It isn't about controlling the woman's body; it removes one of the most sacred and vital functions of the woman. It diminishes her power and strength. It's traumatic for the woman, even more so than birth.   It is for these reasons, I am pro-life."

ThisIsMyUsername4012,2020-01-11 04:38:06,fdtj3ks,t3_en2bku,t1_fdtiqgm,Your response is closest to my beliefs. I believe that it should eventually be legal until birth control can be available enough to prevent conception. It should still remain legal in certain cases such as abuse or incest.

ThisIsMyUsername4012,2020-01-11 04:41:55,fdtjn44,t3_en2bku,t1_fdtjjl7,"I agree with the second, I am skeptical about the extent to which birth control affects health."
IAmTheOptimizer,2020-01-11 04:45:18,fdtk4v8,t3_en2bku,t1_fdtjn44,"That's reasonable. I'm not 100% positive on the first either. My opinion is only based on the best information I've read. With regards to the second point, if we can agree that a embryo/fetus is a living human person, how would you decide when they could be legally killed?"
Milton_Price19,2020-01-11 04:47:46,fdtkho7,t3_en2bku,t1_fdtj3ks,"I'm glad to hear that you've established foundational beliefs. The world will be a much better place when people can actually discuss their perceptions of morality without judgement and be met with the same well-intentioned regard.  I do believe, though, that birth control is widely available. Planned Parenthood, though I do not agree with many of their actions or opinions, will provide free contraceptives to the public. Condoms are also free from health clinics. It is more, for me, about personal responsibility. If an individual isn't willing to make time to use the resources available to him or her, and then engages in sexual acts, then these individuals must also acknowledge that pregnancy could be an eventuality. This is also no reason to terminate a pregnancy.   I used to believe that in the instance of rape and incest an abortion could be performed. However, I have changed my mind, since rape crimes can fabricated. And, if I allow a falsehood to predicate an action I already find immoral, I would hold myself contrary to my beliefs. There is a slippery slope there. In the case of incest, however, I am still struggling.   Thank you for being so willing to talk about this tough issue."

Birth control prevents this by not allowing for the gamete to become an embryo. I believe that at no point past this should it be killed.

Most pro-lifers would rather having a living mother than both a dead mother and a dead child, assuming diagnoses were extremely confident.   As for incest and abuse, the camp is somewhat divided but I believe the intellectually consistent view is still to preserve the life of the unborn as they are innocent. Both situations are terrible but I believe the temporary trauma for the mother, while she carries the child before offering it for adoption, is a preferable alternative to answering the horror of incest or rape with another death."

After that, the development of the zygote/fetus/baby is continuous.  Regarding sperm and eggs, they don't develop, not until they combine and fertilisation occurs. And not many people eat human eggs that I know of.  A fetus is not a potential life, it's already a unique human life with its own DNA. It has the potential to become an adult, or more specifically an artist, scientist, mother, police officer, etc., just like any child which is also not fully developed.  Contraception, such as using a condom, prevents the creation of new life. Hence the term contraception, meaning to prevent conception, the point at which new life begins. And yes, there's a big difference which is why pro-lifers much prefer you use a condom rather than get an abortion."

YoungMaestroX,2020-01-11 12:04:51,fdv7ldo,t3_en2bku,t3_en2bku,"1. Birth control *is* according to the Catholic Church immoral. That being said the teaching on all sexual morality is consistent such that if you don't follow the teaching to: have sex with one person and for that one person to be your wife you are hardly going to listen to the teaching on birth control if you have multiple partners and dont engage in sex when you are ready for the potential consequences.   So if people are going to do that, by all means they should use birth control.   2. I am pro life because:  It is wrong to kill innocent human life  From the moment of conception it is a unique human life (95% of biologists n=5502 affirm this)   Therefore from the moment of conception the child has the inalienable right to life.  That is really the crux of the argument, you can get into fights over personhood and which rights are more fundamental, by ultimately it's a really simple argument and nothing I have seen disproves it."

You seem to be genuine and I really respect that. It's through efforts like yours that we can work together and find a reasonable solution. Best wishes!
Nether7,2020-01-13 01:33:29,fe60r7z,t3_enw3dq,t3_enw3dq,"Thanks for being civil as well. Im sure this isn't comfortable for you. I'll try to concoct a decent response, but Im bound to forget something. Here I go:  1-The right to live is inalienable, unless due punishment is warranted. This means capital punishment may be accepted by the pro-life crowd (and often times isn't), but it doesn't contradict in any manner the defense of the unborn, as an unborn human cant be morally compared to, say, a mass murderer.  2-The right to live is the basis for all other rights, as any right you may have depends entirely on the premise of you being alive. Any ""rights"" conferred to the deceased are merely laws that enforce some dignity to any and all, and often times could be described as the right of the family of the deceased to see the deceased receive a dignified departure, and of the living to know they'll receive such a treatment once they die. As such, bodily autonomy cant be an argument for abortion, as it would switch around the ethical axiom, ignoring the premise to benefit without restriction from a consequence of the premise they decided to ignore.  3-The unborn child is not a part of the mother's body. They are merely a temporary passenger as per the nature of mammal reproduction. Once the zygote is formed, we must consider it a new individual, as what defines each and every one of us at a material level is our genetics and, furthermore, our physiology. It is within the zygote's genome to develop him/herself into a fully developed human, but to do so, they will depend on the mother's biological support, mainly nutrients and immune system. This is established embryology and anyone who says otherwise is either a liar or ignorant on the topic. It is also within the mother's genome to be structured to sustain the changes that a pregnancy entails. As such, to dehumanize a clearly defined human or to treat a pregnancy as an unbearable burden is just twisting reality to fit a narrative.  4-There is no pro-abortion argument that switches the focus to the concept of ""personhood"" that wont A-be ableist (at least to an extent), and/or B-open legal and ethical precedents to the extermination of already-born disabled people. The arguments always can be boiled down to the same thing: ""the unborn doesn't have X trait that could humanize it, so let's kill him/her before they develop such a trait, completely ignoring the fact that, in almost all cases, if we wait, the unborn will develop just fine, making it more able than the average disabled person"".  5-To expand on the previous point, there is no comparison between the physiological process of developing a functioning brain, with a conscience and all, and the pathological process of death. It's different from all aspects, except from the immediate lack of functionality and the apparent absence of a conscience.  6-Margaret Sanger was a white supremacist who (in her autobiography) admits to giving lectures to the KKK. She is famous in part for indirectly inspiring the nazi party in their eugenics. There are other texts of her, the most famous being one in which she claims to have promoted the concept of using abortion to favor black and poor women (which allegedly is to allow them the chance to get out of their socioeconomic situation) as a means of promoting race-based and non-imposed abortion, something she claimed in the same text that it should remain a secret to the average black person in the US. She is also the creator of Planned Parenthood, which is known for placing much of their clinics in predominantly black neighborhoods. In other words, propaganda convincing women abortion is good for them created a veiled genocide in the US, one in which the victims comply with it fully, out of immediate self-interest. To expand upon it, that is the case with all abortion, as people will select who gets to live based on superfluous and unethical reasons, such as syndromes, under the excuse of having the right to decide if they let the pregnancy go on or not. I believe it was Finland that was celebrating the nigh-extinction of Down's Syndrome in their country through early screening and selective abortion. Cuba has very low child mortality rates, among other reasons, because they can abort the weaker unborn compulsively and those don't necessarily appear in child mortality statistics (plus, it's a dictatorship, they can simply lie in their data). Dont get me started on China, who recently (I believe it was in march/2019) switched their stance on abortion as soon as they realized they had ~33mi men exceeding the number of women, and now promote having kids as a form of patriotism. **TL;DR**: abortion leaves people, both born and unborn, vulnerable to eugenics and genocide, as both can be applied within legality under the guise of the individual freedom to abort."

Teutiaplus,2020-01-13 01:37:46,fe615pb,t3_enw3dq,t3_enw3dq,The others have gotten most of the things I would say except this.  One of prochoicers arguments is the women's right to bodily autonomy.  From what I understand the basic counter is since sex is used for reproduction the women becomes obligated to care for whatever child may be created.
bigworduser,2020-01-13 01:44:02,fe61rbz,t3_enw3dq,t1_fe5v4x6,"Well, scientifically speaking, it is alive. Life is a continuum and new a human life begins at fertilization. This is not disputed in biology. After all, even plants have life without a brain, so why would a fetus need a brain to be alive?  But as far as brain function, the brain starts electrical activity around the 5th week. And I do wonder, why would brain functioning matter as to whether or not we can kill someone?"
LunaTheNightmare,2020-01-13 01:46:36,fe62024,t3_enw3dq,t1_fe61rbz,Because (this is just my opinion ) if it were a 20 yo we'd call them brain dead and pull the plug. The biology argument makes sense and I'll make sure to look further into that so thank you
MadameGarbage86,2020-01-13 01:53:47,fe62of8,t3_enw3dq,t1_fe62024,Do you think we'd call them brain dead and pull the plug if we knew with certainty that they'd regain brain function in 9 months?
LunaTheNightmare,2020-01-13 01:54:49,fe62rzl,t3_enw3dq,t1_fe62of8,"That's actually a good question that made me think, thanks"
bigworduser,2020-01-13 01:58:36,fe634s6,t3_enw3dq,t1_fe62024,"&gt; if it were a 20 yo we'd call them brain dead and pull the plug.    Now I can see why you would think that you need a functioning brain to be considered alive, just based on brain death being the best indicator of someone's death. Brain death is the closest clinical correlate we have to a human being's death. The previous indicator for death was heart (cardiac) death.   But the heart dying is just the indicator; what people are actually looking for is the human being's (human organism's) death. And so it is with the brain. Furthermore, death is an *irreversible loss of bodily functioning*, but there is not an irreversible loss of anything with a human fetus (normally), so they are not considered dead, unlike the 20 year old.   Also, just to overload you with yet another argument, animals have functioning brains, many better functioning than human infants, but we do not value them the way we value humans. Therefore, having a functioning brain is not enough. You need something more than that to get human worth. And that's why pro-lifers ground human worth in the kind of thing that you are (a human being/a human organism/a member of the species homo sapiens) and they don't ground our human worth in a function that we can perform (brain waves) or a property that we possess (having a living brain). Otherwise, animals would be people too.  And finally, brain functioning comes in degrees. If some has a more brain functioning than someone else, it follows that they have more value, since brain functioning is what gives value (according to your theory). But human equality is true, therefore this strongly disconfirms placing human value in brain functions.   Hope I didn't overload you. Cheers."
die_2_self,2020-01-13 03:08:53,fe69qln,t3_enw3dq,t3_enw3dq,"Human beings are made in the image of God and thus have an objective and irreversible value and dignity, and are worthy of life.   it is wrong and evil to kill/murder humans.  At conception human life begins and everything after that is scientifically and unarguably merely further human development. (Fetus, baby, toddler, teen, adult, etc.)  Abortion is scientifically and unarguably the intentional murder/killing of a unborn human life and is therefore wrong and evil."
FryingAir,2020-01-13 03:10:24,fe69v7w,t3_enw3dq,t3_enw3dq,"Look up Abby Johnson on social media, read her 2 books, and watch her movie, Unplanned. She was previously a Planned Parenthood worker and had 2 abortions herself."
NigerianPrincessScam,2020-01-13 03:48:27,fe6cyyf,t3_enw3dq,t3_enw3dq,I would honestly advise just watching Steven Crowder's Change My Mind segment on this topic. He does a very good job of outlining why prolifers believe a fetus is a human being. The fundamental disagreement on abortion is really about at what point do you believe life begins in (or out) of the womb.
WillMeatLover,2020-01-13 03:55:06,fe6dh97,t3_enw3dq,t3_enw3dq,"From my perspective, the issue is obfuscated at times by dishonest people and at other times by people who are misinformed, poor debators, and easily led astray by the oceans of misinformation that exist. I mean this generally about everyone arguing on either side, so don't take offense.  Having said that, I want to cleave to the heart of the matter. I think the crux of the matter is that a zygote is a human life and that is the perspective of most people who identify as pro-life. Or in other words, that an unborn child is already a human being and life does not begin after birth.  Personal choice has never been about the right to kill human beings who inconvenience you. Nor has poverty or hardship ever been a reason to kill people. Or at least, no moral critically thinking person can say so.  Which is why the main ""pro-choice"" argument is that an unborn child is not a human being at all, but rather a clump of cells. A meaningless argument that can be made about any human being. An argument that can be made about certain people in comas, but we do not condone murdering them.   (Though there is some debate about that as well, I will admit, but my position there is congruent. I don't believe in killing the comatose and if I ever fall into a coma I do not want to be killed.)  However, if we know with a certainty that a person in a coma will recover after 9 nine months of treatment then there is no argument to be had whatsoever and the only discussion becomes one of resources where some people do not want the inconvenience of taking care of the person in the coma for 9 months and thereafter while they recover.  Anything more than this and we begin entertaining the idea that murder is acceptable where life is inconvenient."
bigworduser,2020-01-13 04:43:23,fe6gza4,t3_ena1z1,t1_fe66ohl,"Not really. It actually has nothing implying that women *need* a child. Both women, in the picture, *had* a child; one woman sacrificed her child for material wealth, which has been going on since ancient times. The other woman realizes the value of the child is MUCH greater than any award or wealth. Their is no implication that a woman ""needs"" a child to be happy.   Perhaps you didn't know the necessary context which had the Golden Globe winner on the left, thanking abortion for helping her win the award. This actually happened at the recent awards show, which is why this picture exists."
bigworduser,2020-01-13 04:45:18,fe6h41a,t3_ena1z1,t1_fdza1ro,"Yes, the context is necessary."
Prolifebabe,2020-01-13 04:48:36,fe6hc7a,t3_enw3dq,t3_enw3dq,I personally think abortion is a human rights issue. We are humans from conception so our right to life should be protected from that moment on since without life all the other rights wouldn't exist. Hope that helps!
bigworduser,2020-01-13 04:54:59,fe6hrrz,t3_ena1z1,t1_fe6h9rs,"&gt;there is actually no public records of her having one, and she didn’t explicitly say she did  Perhaps I am conflating her speech with the one from Michelle Williams (same awards show), who said she got an abortion and it got her to where she is today.   &gt;She said she was thankful for the choice.   In that light it actually makes the comic more sexist.   &gt;   &gt;Since it implies that the only right choice is motherhood.  Well, you don't stop being a mother in an abortion. It just makes you a mother of a dead child.  But yes, the only right choice is to not kill the child for selfish gain. That's pretty much the entire contention of the pro-life movement. It has nothing to do with saying women are a lesser sex or something.   Although, seeing as they got the wrong actress up there, this cartoon does seem kinda false and confusing."
bigworduser,2020-01-13 05:17:30,fe6j83i,t3_ena1z1,t1_fe6i5uv,"Meh, seems pretty clear she's talking about ""she wouldn't have been able to"" get her award without choosing an abortion. A ""woman's right to choose"" is the phrase she used, which is really only ever used in the context of an abortion."
A_Berry_Nice_Guy,2020-01-13 05:25:27,fe6jpws,t3_enzow1,t3_enzow1,"I think the most important thing, at least for me, is that in my opinion life begins at conception. Abortion is the killing of an innocent life. If I saw you pull a gun on someone, I'd try to stop you and voice that I think it's wrong. Same with abortion"
thesmartbrunette,2020-01-13 05:32:42,fe6k5z0,t3_enzow1,t3_enzow1,95% of biologists agree that human life begins at fertilization (conception) because that is when a unique human being is created.
MarioFanaticXV,2020-01-13 05:33:24,fe6k7j7,t3_enw3dq,t3_enw3dq,My beliefs on the matter are as follows:   * A baby is human at the zygote stage when it has a unique genetic code that separates it from its parents.  * Executions should only be used to punish to those who have been duly convicted beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law of murder and/or rape.  * Abortion is thus the unjust killing of a human being.
thesmartbrunette,2020-01-13 05:36:50,fe6keyp,t3_enzow1,t1_fe6jtox,"Pro-life considers both mother &amp; baby. Not all pro-life people are religious, but if you are truly Christian, you are taught to love one another and not hate anyone."
PixieDustFairies,2020-01-13 05:43:01,fe6ksal,t3_enzow1,t3_enzow1,"Well, biologically life begins at conception. At that point, a zygote meets all of the biological requirements for being an individual living organism. By nature of his or her DNA, that life is human, as humans cannot have monkey or duck offspring. Any other line that we can draw is completely arbitrary.  Your own beliefs also seem inconsistent. You say abortion should always be available, but you draw a line at somewhere ""too late in the pregnancy."" If that's the case, then a woman who does not know she is pregnant until it's ""too late"" would not have abortion available to her. What would this point be? Why is it suddenly wrong to kill a baby a day after this arbitrary line, but it's fine to do so before?  Mothers certainly have financial and emotional needs, but can you at least agree that there are some morally illegitimate ways of fulfilling those needs? Like if someone is poor, does that give them the right to steal from the rich? Likewise, abortion is not the answer. It does not magically solve her problems. What must happen is we need to support people who have unmet needs so that they can choose life."
A_Berry_Nice_Guy,2020-01-13 05:45:52,fe6kygx,t3_enzow1,t1_fe6kval,"But I don't think that when life begins is subjective, right? You are either alive or not. So i believe that a person is objectively alive at conception"
PixieDustFairies,2020-01-13 05:49:13,fe6l5pq,t3_enzow1,t1_fe6jtox,"No, we value both lives equally. If the mom doesn't get an abortion, barring miscarriage or sudden tragic death of the mother, it's a win win scenario because noth mom and baby get to live. Without the right to life, no other rights to exist. There's this idea that denying abortion will deny women happiness, freedom, etc. But with abortion, all of those things are denied to her child. It seems wildly unfair.  I'm religious, but I wouldn't hate someone just because of their beliefs or skin colors. That also is a non sequitur, a red herring, and an ad hominem attack. We were discussing whether or not abortion is moral, but pro choicers have a tendency to move away from the conversation at hand to talk about some other thing. I could also say, ""You're not pro choice if you're not for the choice to own a gun!"" which is a different topic."
PixieDustFairies,2020-01-13 05:56:23,fe6lko7,t3_enzow1,t1_fe6kyp4,"Well, it's rare, but it has happened, sometimes it was so bad that a woman didn't know she was pregnant until after she gave birth. A lot of these women did not recognize the symptoms of their pregnancy.  And in more likely cases, women may have been incredibly conflicted and it took them a long time to decide. I don't have a list of data on reasons why women get late term abortions, but from what I hear they're not that different from getting first trimester abortions."

RedditReading10,2020-01-13 08:34:10,fe6tb5k,t3_enzow1,t3_enzow1,"To start off, thank you for being open minded about learning pro life views! Many people who advocate for abortions are very closed minded and I admire your willingness to see the other side especially at such a young age!  As many people have already said in this post, a new unique genetic code is formed at conception (right at the start where the father’s sperm hits the mother’s ova). Source: https://www.justthefacts.org/get-the-facts/when-life-begins/.This is very important as the baby already has a DNA that is different to that of his/her mother. Many people who advocate for abortions claim that it is their body and so it is their choice but that is factually inaccurate right from the start. It is not just their body as there are two unique genetic codes.  You seem not totally convinced with this argument from other people’s comments on this post so let’s dig deeper on some other stuff! Most mother’s only know they are pregnant between 4 to 7 weeks after conception. Source: https://americanpregnancy.org/week-by-week/5-weeks-pregnant/. The babies heartbeat is formed as early as 5 and a half weeks. Source: https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/when-can-you-hear-babys-heartbeat. If anyone has a heartbeat then most people consider that to be living as our hearts only stop beating once we are dead. Also, pretty much any animal on this earth and every mammal does have a heart and they are living too. Most women only figure out they are pregnant about the time the heart beat is forming. Therefore, abortions performed almost always happen while the babies heart is beating. If you think a heart beat is the indication to life then abortion should seem to be killing a living organism.  The babies nervous system is also starting to form just after 2 weeks which is a lot earlier than when most mothers know they are pregnant. Source: https://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/fetal-development/fetal-brain-nervous-system/  Original DNA which predetermined the babies eye color, hair color, hair thickness, how tall they are going to be, etc. is a good indication to know if it’s a life. A heartbeat at 6 weeks and nervous system formation at 2 weeks confirms this too. Let me know what you think and if you have any questions for me. To me, the science and facts are there."

chickenwontonsoup,2020-01-13 12:34:14,fe7sqx1,t3_ena1z1,t1_fe6gza4,Yes that is one angle to view indeed. I do believe that a child is definitely a priceless gift. However I do believe that a child should have the right to receive a caring and nurturing mother who is dedicated towards its wellbeing as well. I think that it would be beneficial towards the child and the mother as well.   It's much better to have a ready mother who can provide for her child than a mother who is currently dedicated to other priorities in life or even one who is currently procuring the needs for her own self first and foremost.  And that perhaps can start with women being able to choose and completely willing to have their baby.

Furthermore, stopping burdensome treatments for a patient that is in the process of dying is not actively killing them. Using artificial means to prolong someone's life is above and beyond what is morally required, and if a patient dies after being taken off life support, the cause of death is whatever the final stages of their illness leads to. If left alone, healthy fetuses ordinarily survive to term. When you get an abortion, you're actively and intentionally introducing something that will kill that fetus."

Its a very standard argument to make.  The question of when personhood begins is beside the point. Its not as if pro-choicers themselves believe that the vagina is a magical portal towards personhood. The thing inside can still be a person and killed.

Suffering and pleasure are not subjective - they are an actual part of reality (not the perception of it), but that's not really the point.

Utilitarianism is characterized by impartiality.  &gt;how is one to know the consequences of every action anyway?  Experience, logic, probability.  &gt;Is the goal here long-term happiness or short-term?  The greatest amount of pleasure."

So if a mother aborted a fetus because it was her choice, but the father and grandparents were both traumatized by the extinguishing of this life, is the abortion still a morally good act?  What if the mother was coerced into abortion because the father is a rapist and wanted to hide evidence that he raped her, like in the case of [Christopher Brammer](http://www.courts.ca.gov/opinions/nonpub/F062897.PDF)? Is abortion the morally good act there?  &gt;Experience, logic, probability.  Please apply those concepts to the act of knowing how much suffering or pleasure an unborn individual will bring.  &gt;Then it's not utilitarianism. You just said that ""It [pure hedonism] is the only thing that matters."" Is this incorrect then?  If I'm understanding this correctly, utilitarianism is about getting the maximum amount of pleasure across all people and minimizing suffering. And you're positing that being pro-life ultimately raises the level of suffering, right? The onus is on you then to prove this, not us. You're the one making a claim, so the burden of proof is on you. How is the pro-life position anti-utilitarian?"

You're giving the benefit of the doubt to a situation where *a rapist is forcing a woman into an abortion to cover up his crimes*. Are you just going to dig your heels in every situation and not relent a little? Isn't there the slightest possibility that your viewpoint could use some adjusting?  &gt;It causes suffering to both mother and child, isn't that obvious?  The pro-life viewpoint wants to prevent the child from dying. It does not cause suffering. Unless of course, you want to argue that...  &gt;You cannot go wrong with nonexistence. There is no suffering without existence.  Okay, so utilitarianism is just nihilism without the guts to say it's nihilism.

samcp_,2020-01-15 02:18:05,fefemb8,t3_enzow1,t3_enzow1,"I know I’m a little late to the party, but here goes:  We start with the principle that murder is wrong. But what is murder? If we look at the examples, we can see that murder is the unjust taking of a human life. So now we have to define human life:  Life is scientific. Therefore, when organismal life begins is not subjective: it is objective. (I say organismal so as to distinguish it from individual living auxiliary cells in the body, such as blood cells or sperm and egg cells. We’re talking about an organism being alive as a whole, which has many criteria, but we’ll use the one of homeostasis: its parts must be working with each other.) From the moment of conception, when a new set of diploid human DNA is formed, the life cycle begins, and 95% of biologists agree that this is when human life starts. And we know the embryo is human because its parents were human and it has the genotype characteristic of and specific to humans. So an embryo/fetus is a living human.  But perhaps being human and alive aren’t the only characteristics that make murder wrong. So we’ll define that which we cannot unjustly kill (and which in general has what we deem human rights) a “person.” Now what constitutes a person? (Interestingly enough, I pulled this part of the argument partially from a pro-choice argument.) Well, let’s test some organisms to see if they qualify: all living, born humans we know of are persons, so what makes them persons? Let’s use a hypothetical whose principles we’ll apply to reality. If there were a living creature, maybe an alien, who could think on as high a level as us and were able to communicate its ideas, we’d probably consider it a person. So what links them and humans as opposed to all other creatures? It’s their rationality, their ability to reason (and most likely have some sort of moral intentionality). But what if they can’t think yet? Maybe they’re still newborns and haven’t fully developed their intellects. Well, they’re still persons, so the connection must be their *characteristic* rationality, or their being the kind of thing that can reason. As the defining characteristic (or an essential one) of humans is that we’re rational, that must mean all humans are people. So a fetus or embryo is just as much a person as an infant, child, or adult, and thus you cannot kill them.  To further clarify the idea of choice here, I’d like to mention that we’re talking about this politically, as in whether the government should deny women the ability to kill their offspring. But most modern liberal (not like Democrat liberal, but classically liberal as in rights and freedom) governments are based on principles of securing natural rights, such as the one to life. The American founding principle, for example, is stated in the Declaration of Independence:  &gt;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are *life*, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, that *to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men*...  Governments are there to, for one, prevent persons from being killed. So they’re denying women their choice just as much as they deny women the choice to kill their newborn. Thus, they can rightly, and ought to, forbid abortion.  What about the bodily autonomy argument? I’ll forego arguing that the baby’s not a part of the woman’s body, because that’s fairly obvious from my earlier argument. I’ll address the idea that a fetus is somehow invading a mother’s body or violating her rights, and so she can kill, or at least remove, it. The thing is, in 99% of cases, the parents consented to sex, and consent includes the mother. So she actually took voluntary part in an action that has the consequence (and biological purpose) of a possible pregnancy. So she helped put that baby in the situation, and so she shouldn’t kill it or leave it to die. I like to use the analogy of if you agree to go rock-climbing and you have to hold the rope for someone who’s climbing, if they slip, can you let go of the rope? No, since you agreed to go rock climbing and thus to the risk of you possibly having to hold someone up. Even if they’re using your body to stay alive, it’s because of an action you assented to, so you must let them. The same goes for pregnancy. For the rare cases of non-consensual sex, there’s an argument to be made for parental obligation, but it’s a bit more nuanced so I won’t get into it here. I’m fairly neutral on that one myself.  So that’s why I’m pro-life: the only scientific and intellectually consistent viewpoint to hold is that it is wrong to kill preborn babies (fetuses, embryos), and the government should forbid such an action."

chickenwontonsoup,2020-01-15 14:39:39,fegp3m0,t3_ena1z1,t1_fegm1gg,"I'm glad that we didn't resort to fists. It's just, I'm pretty sure the world is just so quick to point out that women should know better. Only ""men"" has needs, and that even branches out to excusing polygamies and to worse extents harassment and rape.   On the other hand, women are single-handedly demonized for their actions. Fulfilling their needs are sinful, blasphemous, shameful, devious... you name it.   As if they're the sole cause and reason for having a child. I think that society must accept that men AND women are responsible, and men too, not only women should consider these repercussions. Both of them have responsibilities to fulfill.   Let's try to put it to your narrative shall we? THEY have sex and then SHE has to pay for it?  It's just so easy to say a woman is responsible, SHE had sex for her own pleasure and SHE should know better.. but have sympathy please. Instead of demonizing them, educate them. Educate BOTH women and men. Contraceptives, sex-ed, you name it.   I'm not imploring that you are a misogynist but I know that not all in this subreddit would even think to read this. heck, they'd demonize *me*. I just want them to add men into the discussion more too.  There are so many women in my country exploited by many and forced to bear the consequences. The young are so valued, so glorified, but are shunned by society when the condom breaks or vanishes- left alone to rear a child. Okay, let's say she has the capability alright.. but does anyone think to bat an eye to her wellbeing? The second the baby pops up.. the WORLD will demonize her anyway. With or without a baby. She WILL be shamed.  I just want people to just.. think both sides of the story. And I thank you for this civil conversation and hope this will be the norm here."

I have seen many abortion discussions devolve into nastiness and Ad Hominem's, so being able to have a calm discursion is truly fantastic.  1 Sorry for not taking men into consideration in my original comment, that was straight up wrong on my part.  2 I do believe that both women &amp; men should refrain from sex, as I am against fornication as whole, and in your response, you accidentaly proved the importance of marriage. You mentined how men will sometimes just vanish and leave women to bear the consequences alone. Well, one of the most important functions of marriage is to prevent that from happening. The bond of marriage is supossed to make so that both parents are there for the raising of the child, so that one of them can't just run away.  3 Just like you asked me to be sympathetic toward the woman, I ask you to be sympathetic towards the child. Let's imagine the following situation: A couple commits fornication, the woman gets pregnant and the father runs away. Tell me, did the child do anything wrong? No, they didn't. Then why are you punishing them? The person that should be punished is the dad, for running away from his responsibilities, not the kid.  4 I 100% agree with you that men should also be held responsable for pregnancy. There is no denial in that.  Sorry if this response sounds like I am preaching to you, but that is my genuine opnion. I stand by my ground that we shouldn't punish the son for the sins of the father, but I understand where you are comming from, believe me, I do. The world is still very unfair towards women, but I believe we should work to eliminate the unfairness as a  whole, not simply throw it in the back of the child."

And I say that as a mother who very much intends to breastfeed. It ignores a lot of basic information. A woman can be lactating and still unable to breastfeed for many reasons. It's not uncommon for women to have breastfeeding issues. Now, legally, the woman would probably be at fault for negligence if the baby died from her outright refusing to feed the baby in any way, but you can choose not to breastfeed and still find some other way to feed the baby, even if you don't have any formula. This situation is completely absurd, not at all realistic, and not at all like pregnancy.  While pregnancy may take a physical toll on various individuals, it doesn't involve any specific action the way breastfeeding does.  A better response to the ridiculous IVF clinic scenario is to simply say ""if I choose the embryos does that make the toddler not a human?"" Or even change it to be a pregnant woman and a non pregnant woman and you can only save one - most people would likely choose the pregnant woman because that's two lives over one. And your brain will tell you to choose that even if you are a pro-choicer because you still know it's a human even if you're trying to say it isn't."

Any woman that refuses to breastfeed and doesn't at least make some other attempt to feed that baby is obviously at fault for negligence of the child, but there's no such thing as negligence of a fetus. That doesn't exist and therefore the whole scenario is bad. If you have to qualify a scenario with 20 rules it's not a good scenario. You are speaking to a pregnant woman currently and while that certainly doesn't make me an expert on anything I can tell you this scenario is not at all comparable to pregnancy and abortion. It's almost more idiotic than the IVF clinic scenarios.  It also misses a major point that most women that abort don't believe it's a baby or human yet. Of course that doesn't make it true but there is a major difference between directly neglecting a child and making an uninformed decision to abort. Your scenario also paints the mother as being legally at fault which most pro-lifers don't support in any way shape or form."

The reason why I compare this to negligence is because in many cases negligence is just as bad as actively doing something harmful. Also a lot of pro choicers seem to think that abortion is merely disconnecting someone from life support (if they grant that a fetus might be a person)  I also specifically chose the breastfeeding example because there is nothing unnatural or artificial about the scenario. People don't go around hooking up violinists to people to be used as a dialysis machine and IVF and frozen embryos do not represent most abortion situations.

I would rather discredit the arguments they're using than throw out another bad argument but that's just me. There are far better intellectual ways to discredit the IVF clinic and plug pulling analogies than making up another bad analogy.  The best analogy I've seen (although I'm biased as this is the analogy that made me question my own pro-choice-ness before I was pro-life) was by Stephen Crowder where he says imagine you're driving down a foggy road and you think you see a person ahead in the middle of the road but aren't quite sure - would you slow down just in case or just keep going? The point of his argument is that unless you can definitely tell me when it becomes a human, which of course they can try to do but there is a way to discredit each point they give and move them closer and closer to conception, and then after you show the flaws in their science a few times you say - wouldn't you err on the side of caution? If we can't agree on when life begins shouldn't we err on the side of caution like we would when driving? Wouldn't we err on side of caution in case it IS killing someone? I find this tactic to work fairly well because you aren't getting them to acknowledge that life begins at conception but rather that killing is bad and we should avoid it at all costs that we shouldn't even accidentally kill someone. You don't even have to get them to agree with you in when it is in fact a baby, but simply to agree that defining when it is a baby is so difficult and how could we possibly go on some arbitrary point when the only definitive point is conception?  Anyway, that's the only pro-life analogy that I've seen do any good and hold any water for a long period of time. Most other are extremely flawed (unless they alter a pro-choice analogy to show it's absurdity)."

RemingtonSloan,2020-01-16 09:12:08,fejbos3,t3_ep67ja,t1_fehz3h6,I recently really started being a Christian. Have you considered looking into Orthodoxy? It's really helped me be a stronger Christian intellectually and morally (which is far more important than the former).

cBuzzDeaN,2020-01-16 13:38:31,fejospt,t3_epc9tp,t1_fejeiwk,"I just want to bring in risks/ chances into the game. So if the mother dies 100%, she can abort. If the mother dies 3/4 times, she should be able to abort. If the chance is 50%, is it still okay? Etc.  In this case there is clearly a much higher risk (because shes alone and nobody could help her in case of blood loss etc) AND because of a bad diet and beeing locked into a room, additional risks of an underdeveloped and traumatized child and mother.   So where is the line?  In my eyes, you cant judge a person in such a situation for aborting."
Kaelis64,2020-01-16 14:00:34,fejqfrs,t3_epc9tp,t3_epc9tp,You forgot one important part to make it really applicable to abortion.   The mother kills the baby SO THAT she doesn’t have to use her body to feed the baby.

The Protestant world keys in on the justification part of salvation (getting out of Hell and into Heaven) and kind of forgets the sanctification part (cooperation with God to become more like Christ). You'll hear it said as ""work on your salvation"", but no Orthodox Christian believes they are saving themselves. All salvation comes from Christ.  But yeah, do your own research. I felt that the emphasis of moving the heart was really essential in getting away from who I was and becoming who I ought to be."

RemingtonSloan,2020-01-16 16:44:22,fek5jsl,t3_ep67ja,t1_fejxsd5,"Praying to saints in Orthodoxy is like asking your friends to pray for you. I pray directly to God mostly. Sometimes I'll pray Hail Marys; I find those especially helpful when I have less than respectful desires toward women. But, if you'll read the Hail Mary, it's full of honors that come scripture, and then you just ask her to pray for you.  Praying to saints should never be treated like praying to a deity; you are, by way of the Holy Spirit which unites the Church, requesting for a family member to beg on your behalf. In fact, you're acting on the belief in resurrection and eternal life. No one really knows exactly what happens after death, but there are traditions which come from the apostles which the Church teaches, and there has always been a belief in Christianity that it is okay or even right to ask those who have gone before you for help.  Again, it's usually as simple as ""St. Moses, pray for me. I need courage."" That's something you might tell a friend, right? When your devout friend leaves this world, why shouldn't you still ask him to pray for you? He certainly wants you to become more Christlike now than ever unless he's just asleep."
absoluteapologist,2020-01-16 17:13:22,fek8h68,t3_ep67ja,t1_fek5jsl,"Is it a necessity? I'm a firm believer in Sola Fidas and Sola Scriptura. I don't understand why I need to ask Moses(?) to pray for me when I could just pray to God directly for courage. I prayed directly to God for the strength to overcome on of my strongest demons (I smoked pot heavily for 20+ years), and shortly thereafter, I quit with no issues after having trying to quit multiple times."
MadameGarbage86,2020-01-16 17:56:51,fekcwdy,t3_epc9tp,t1_fek0i87,.. So you don't know if it should be legally publishable for a mother to starve her child to death?
RemingtonSloan,2020-01-16 18:22:09,fekfgb0,t3_ep67ja,t1_fek8h68,"It's not necessary. In my experience, it's rarely brought up. If someone were to tell you it's necessary, they would probably it's necessary in the same way that you should have Christian brothers and sisters which you commune with and ask for help. It's good to pray for people, and so there's nothing wrong with asking for people from beyond to pray for you. There's nothing wrong with being quiet and personal about your needs (to an extent).   I mentioned St. Moses the Ethiopian (different from the Biblical Moses) because his story inspires me. I see him as an older brother in Christ in some ways. I like knowing that there are those who have gone before me and finished and that they're at the finish line rooting for me and you.  Orthodox salvation seems to me to be by grace through faith with works. God is doing the saving, you need to have faith in that, and your works should express and reinforce that faith. You don't pray for a certain number of hours to get a certain number of years taken off of your sentence to purgatory (which the Orthodox don't believe in). In fact, you don't get anything measurable for your works.   My problem with Sola Scriptura was that I had questions about scripture that people couldn't answer or that people gave very different answers on. I realized that by limiting the Holy Spirit's interactions with humanity to the Bible that I was putting God in a box.   Ask yourself this: what miracles has God performed in human history that didn't make it into scripture?  If there's a Church who had the authority to compile and codify scripture, would they not also have the authority to secure the traditional interpretation of scripture?  All that said, if it's not broken, don't fix it. If what you're doing now works, keep doing it. If you ever need to go deeper, know that there's something out there to explore. If God's grace has helped you defeat demons, I don't discount that. That's amazing, and I'm encouraged to hear that. I believe that God's grace is alive in Protestantism because I've been on Protestant mission trips and witnessed the way people are moved, witnessed the change in people's lives first hand. Me? I'm too stiff necked for that kind of Church. I need something deeper and more involved to help secure what I consider to be rather weak faith. So, I listened to hours worth of Fr. Spyridon's homilies and went to speak with a priest and have been captivated ever since on the balanced theology and emphasis on mystery in balance with knowledge."

The fetus can recognize the mother's voice at 25 weeks, so at that point the fetus is surely what we would call a ""baby"". The research is a bit uncertain, but its likely that the fetus can feel pain at 20 weeks.   Even without religion, 2nd or 3rd trimester abortion is murder."

Just like you said, it's already a baby then. I support it only when the mother's life is in danger.  On the other note, yes, majority of reddit is men. But what about subs like twoxchromosomes and such. Those are popular and female based. Wouldn't you argue that the majority of female population overall is pro-choice?

Abortion stops a beating heart if done after six weeks. Feminists can go on about self defense and bodily autonomy and all that but what's more important, bodily autonomy or the right to life? However, I disagree with an outright ban on abortion right now. Before we can think of banning abortion completely we must increase access to contraceptives, and provide better sex education. I also think if we did ban abortion we should have exceptions for the mother's live being at risk which abortions to protect the mother's life should be allowed at any point during the pregnancy, and abortion in the case of rape should be permitted within the first six weeks."

They found that there were no differences in intellectual ability between conservative and liberal students, but that liberal students were significantly more likely to choose to pursue PhD degrees and academic careers, whereas conservative students of identical academic accomplishments were more likely to pursue business careers. They concluded that the greater numbers of liberal than conservative professors could be accounted for by self-selection in career paths, rather than by bias in hiring or promotion  From the same page:  &gt;Lawrence Summers said at a symposium about The Social and Political Views of American Professors that he considers it a problem that some academics express an ""extreme hostility"" to conservative opinions. He observed that faculty who were invited to give Tanner Lectures on Human Values were almost always liberals, and expressed concern that an imbalance in political representation at universities could impede rigorous examination of issues."

The problem in question isn't really about gender, religion, politics or education. Every person is different and has a different opinion. Everything is about morals and what a person considers the beginning of life. Media likes to portray pro-lifers as bad people who want to control other people's bodies while pro-choicers are vicious baby killers. In the end, (in my opinion) both and neither are true. It's just about the angle a person is looking from. I hope all of us are going to work together in the future and one day come to the same conclusion and solve this problem once and for all."

PixieDustFairies,2020-06-10 22:46:19,ftmvlgt,t3_h0lnqb,t3_h0lnqb,"I don't think you need sex ed programs. When I went to school, I wasn't taught much about contraception (though I did a research paper on it and presented it in a Theology class) but we did have a chastity speaker speak to the student body one time and we also talked about issues of sexual morality in a lot of Theology classes.   When it comes to proper terms for body parts, you can do that in a normal biology or anatomy class. There are chapters in biology textbooks dedicated to explaining the structure and function of the reproductive organs.  The problem with contraception in education is that it operates under the assumption that teens will become sexually active and promotes that lifestyle, which is very harmful to them and can destroy innocence. It exposes teens to a whole host of problems, such as higher rates of depression, tons of unnecessary drama, STDs, and teen pregnancies. The expectation should be to wait until marriage because that is how you respect yourself and your future spouse.  If you want to know how disturbing this stuff can be, let me tell you that a lot of sex ed curriculums are made by Planned Parenthood workers. I've looked at a proposal for my local public school district and it had content involving children as young as 11 years old to ""roleplay"" scenarios in which they try to decide whether or not it's a good idea to have sex. This is textbook grooming."

In health class, I was taught about reproductive organs, and about STD’s, pregnancy, saying no to peer pressure, and about artificial birth control(basically being told what they are and that the church says to not use them), and NFP(natural family planning).  Funnily enough, I actually learned about all different types of birth control methods, side effects, and success rates in my theology class.  Granted, it was to shows why we shouldn’t use them, but I learned a lot.  I also learned about being in a proper relationship and how to build a relationship and when intimacy should be introduced in a relationship in my theology class.(the theology lesson was about Christian adulthood so we were learning about controversial topics, such as abortion, birth control, euthanasia, death penalty, etc.)  I really liked how they explained everything because the teachers weren’t trying to encourage us or try and completely normalize teenage sex.  I also think it helped that it wasn’t really sex education, or labeled as such.  It was a lesson about reproductive health in my health class, and learning about birth control in my theology class.   Like I said in my original post, I think more comprehensive sex ed should be given.  But I think it should be taught it health class, where you learn about reproductive organs, STD’s and pregnancy, and birth control(different kinds, success rates, side effects) and abstinence."

I don't see how it will encourage sex if you are having open honest discussions with your teenager about sex while instilling whatever values you want your child to know about sex.

I get that you support it, but it's been shown time and time again not to work, at all. That doesn't mean it needs to be taught harder.

Also, I don't know if schools are the right place to be handing them out either.  It's convenient, but it always felt like the school normalizing the behavior which really doesn't sit right with me considering that their target audience is minors.    And birth control or not, and hormones or not, teens should avoid sex like the plague if they can.  If you're lucky, all that happens is awkward sex with someone you're not going to see after graduation.  It pretty much goes downhill from there."

We were taught all the types of birth control but it was clear that **abstinence is the only 100% effective way**.  We were also taught the anatomy, puberty, healthy relationships, peer pressure, etc.   This is the timeline I think should occur:   4-6 grade: Teach basic reproductive anatomy, puberty and consent (don't touch if he/she doesn't let you).   Early middle school (grade 6-7): Same stuff as elementary school (albeit a little more advanced), along with peer pressure, STD's, sexual harassment, and the fact that abstinence is the only 100% effective way  Last year of middle school: start introducing birth control  Freshman year of HS: Same stuff as before, but add in more about birth control and more advanced ideas of 'healthy vs unhealthy relationships' and other miscellaneous stuff.    I think teaching abstinence a year before birth control will give them a predetermined notion that abstinence is the best method before they learn about birth control.  Birth control will still be taught eighth grade (13 y/o) so it will be before most of them are having sex anyways.    I also think sex ed should have an opt out option.  I personally would want to opt my kids out and teach them myself bc you never know what they are learning now (I wouldn't want my 5 year old learning about trans and being told that he should experiment thinking he's a girl)"

Should 18-19 year olds be having sex? Yeah sure, it's fun, healthy and has been shown a good sex life makes people happier and less depressed.  STD's aren't as big of a deal as they used to be thanks to modern medicine and with good education and modern day birth control the risks of a healthy sex life are pretty low."

Since stopping other people from sinning is not what God commands of us (I know some believers believe that failing to stop others from sinning will be used by God during our judgment but that is a very contested interpretation IME).

For example, water is absolutely essential for human beings to survive and thrive. Without it, we die in a matter of days. Hence, one could make the case that water should be essentially free as it is. You might pay extra to have it bottled or conveniently sent to your home, but the water itself is free. Contraceptives, however, are not only not necessary for human flourishing - people can live perfectly healthy, happy lives without contraception (as have most humans in the history of the world) - but they are positively harmful to human flourishing. To use contraception is to attempt to actively prevent procreation. But procreation is the purpose of sex, the only reason it ultimately exists. There are secondary reasons, like the unity of the couple, but these exist so that couple will have a stronger bond and, therefore, be more fit for raising children together. Hence, the use of contraception is irrational and immoral, since morality derives from nature's purposes and whether we conform to them. Not to mention, the contraceptive mentality is what leads to the vast majority of abortions. People who think sex is not ultimately about procreation engage in sexual activity using ""protection"" which nevertheless results in pregnancy on occasion. Then, since the parents do not ""want"" the child, and in many cases they have not made a commitment to one another, they are willing to rationalize the murder of their child. This is a byproduct of the contraceptive mentality, and pro-life folks must wake up to this reality."

It doesn't promote anything to the rest of the cohort.   &gt;It exposes teens to a whole host of problems, such as higher rates of depression, tons of unnecessary drama, STDs, and teen pregnancies.  Its important for teenagers to understand these concepts. Unless you're saying sex ed causes them, which is absurd.   &gt;The expectation should be to wait until marriage because that is how you respect yourself and your future spouse.  That's shouldn't be the expectation, and its utter nonsense and simply isn't applicable to most people's relationships. Studies have shown 90% of people are having premarital sex, whether its in a committed relationship or not.   Wait until marriage is NOT good advice anymore. Sorry. That's the world we live in.    Teenagers should be taught sex isn't actually a big deal. They should be taught to do it in a safe, consensual and comfortable manner when both people are ready and don't feel pressured.

If adequate care was given to all pregnant women, they were taught the signs of complications, and as you said, were taken seriously, the chances of maternal death would greatly be reduced.  The other 40% could probably be reduced if more attentive care, treatment for pre-existing conditions, and, once again, educating them on signs of complications and listening to them.   Also, maternal death has be going down as more advances in medicine are made."

What is it about maternal death rates that you find to be so relevant to the morality of abortion though?   I mean, I can see it argued for a victim of rape if they lived in a country with an astronomically high rate.

The main events in this stage of  development are illustrated in the figure below and described in detail  in the rest of this concept. **The germinal stage lasts a total of eight  to nine days. It begins in a Fallopian tube when an ovum is fertilized  by a sperm to form a zygote (day 0).** The germinal stage continues as the  zygote undergoes several initial cell divisions to form a solid ball of  cells called a morula (days 3-4). It then continues as the morula  undergoes additional changes to become a hollow ball of cells called a  blastocyst (days 5-7). The germinal stage ends when the blastocyst  implants in the endometrium of the uterus (days 8-9). After implantation  occurs, the blastocyst is called an embryo, and it will soon obtain  nutrients from the mother’s blood via a temporary organ called the  placenta. In the germinal stage, however, nutrients must be obtained  from cell cytoplasm or secretions in the Fallopian tube or uterus."

The arguments and definitions and whatnot are just a way to fit the value into our current moral/legal framework.   If you are prochoice, the value is that women should generally be able to get an abortion if they want to. The reason that I think that simply comes from my compassion for a woman who is pregnant and does not want to be, I think that would be terrible and wouldn't want to deny someone a way to get out of that situation. That would be the reason that I am prochoice. However that is not the same as the arguments for it, we have a basic moral/legal framework that most people seem to largely agree on, so the arguments just show how the value can or should exist within that framework,  since i realize that ""I think its a good idea"" isnt a terribly compelling argument,  even if that is more or leas the reason that I personally use."

The pro choice movement can’t even decide when the cutoff for abortion should be. I have heard 15 weeks, viability, 24 weeks, 31 weeks, I’ve heard right up until birth. I personally would respect the pro choice movement as a whole more if they could decide on a single argument. I’ve heard that you can kill it because it’s a clump of cells, because it’s in your body, because you’re in danger, because it doesn’t have brain activity, because it doesn’t have organs, because it’s not sentient, because it’s not human. I’ve also heard it is a person, just not deserving of rights. That in mind, I have respect for an individual and educated pro choicer, many who I’ve talked to and while disagreed, respected their argument more than some other, extremely stupid arguments I’ve heard."

The impetus for agreement in a movement is so that you can have a coherent goal, but since it's already legal, there isn't as much need to do that.  It's like if I said some town was the best place to grow up because of the great parks it had, ans someome else said it was the best because of the schools and someone else said it was the economy. What you saying is that because we cannot agree *why* its the best town, that it somehow invalidates our opinion that it is the best town.

Ok.  &gt;The flaw with forms/surveys is that you can only tick boxes that are there and there isn’t a box that says “injury/trauma from previous birth”. There probably won’t be one ever because it doesn’t feed the narrative of ‘safe, healthy pregnancies’  Most pregnancies are safe and healthy though, and we do have a question about why they have abortions themselves (the category of health issues fills the need for that) they also can check other reasons so even if we don't ask them about their previous birth experiences they can express this on other ways and the percentage is not high.   &gt;Childbirth is the only event you can come out of having being transfused with 17 litres of blood, barely hung on to your uterus and left with permanent kidney and bladder damage, pain causing internal adhesions and severe PTSD and have that be a ‘safe, healthy outcome’.  I'm sorry you had terrible birth experiences, but the stats do count these events apart from having the baby survive the birth. You shared them yourself.  &gt;Approximately 40% of women (so 1.6 million women globally every year) will have outcomes like this where their risks in future pregnancies are now very high.   Source?   &gt;Do you think those experiences are never a factor in choosing abortion?  Your question was about mortality rate not the possible health outcomes. I do think it probably influences some but the majority of women that abort list economic reasons for abortion not health reasons. Hence why until that become the number 1 reason women abort it's pointless to add it to the discussion."

But these two types of healthcare do not harm anyone else. But abortion harms the fetus inside you. It's not healthcare unless it risks your life by continuing to carry it.   These are not good arguments to promote your case that consent to sex is consent to pregnancy. Whether it's healthcare or not does not impact whether it is consent."

If I’m walking down the street to buy food at the gas station, am I consenting to being assaulted?  If I take my dog out for a walk with my door unlocked, am I consenting to to robbery?  If I go out to an intoxicated club in skimpy clothing, am I consenting to rape?  The idea that I am consenting to anything other than what I consented to is not consent.   If I consent to anal, that doesn’t mean I consent to vaginal because the person might fall into the wrong hole.   If I consent to someone staying at my house, I don’t immediately consent to them using what I did not give them consent to use.   If I consent to a police search and they drop something, I am not consenting to planting of evidence.   This mindset of consenting to something that wasn’t agreed upon is dangerous and there needs to be more than a blanket statement that all possibilities follow consent.

By definition, consent is permission or an agreement for something to happen. You don't really ""consent"" to getting pregnant any more than you consent to losing money at a casino or defecating after eating food. It's a normal, likely and expected consequence of a specific action, not something that one would consent to, such as sexual intercourse."

But the thing is, you can perform procedures to save the mother's life that do not directly kill the baby. It's the Principle of Double Effect. If a reasonable effort is made to save the baby's life as well as the mother's, then it's not abortion. Even if the baby dies.  &gt;But, if it's okay with you, could you share with us why she didn't do it and how's your relationship with her?  Well, she *did* do it. She took two abortion pills about 8 weeks into her pregnancy, but she was so sick that she threw them up and I was born. She admitted she did it because pregnancy was very difficult on her body and she didn't want to be pregnant. I personally think that's only part of it, because what kind of loving mother would give up on having their child just because it was difficult? My guess is it was part not wanting to be pregnant, but also because she didn't want to keep having children with my dad, whom she never loved in the first place and never wanted to marry, but married him anyway. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯   She never really apologized for it or thought it was wrong, and she also lied to me about it for 20 years (my dad told me from a very young age that my mom tried to abort me, yeah he's disgusting for having done that but that's another mess there).  My relationship with her? Not good, obviously. It's sad because as a kid I admired her and thought she was very warm and loving, but as an adult, I see now that she was actually very emotionally negligent. I do love her but as a person, but I don't like her and I don't feel any warmth or affection towards her. I keep praying for her and I wish we could reconcile, but if she doesn't think what she did was that bad then it's VERY difficult to reconcile with her. I forgive her and wish her the best, but her heart is so walled-off (and sadly, so is mine) that I decided it's just best for me to move on."

If they don't feel that the unborn are a human being (or person or whatever), then you won't get them to change their mind on this free will thing. So it's time to address the human being topic.  First up, their criminal code thing is an appeal to the law fallacy. They might as well say ""Abortion is legal, so that means it's fine!"" It's not a good argument since tons of horrific actions in the past have been covered by the law.  A fetus is a unique human individual. It's not a separate ""thing"" from us, but merely a different stage of life: zygote, embryo, fetus, neonate (newborn baby), teenager, adult. We were all a fetus at one point, and none of us were ever a sperm or an egg. [95%](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3211703) of biologists agree that life begins at conception.  So they may shift the goalposts to personhood. That requires an even longer conversation, but I highly recommend reading [this webpage](https://prolife.stanford.edu/theory/premise2a-3.html) that addresses the concept. It takes about 15 min or so but you'll be well-equipped to discuss it afterward."

bigworduser,2020-06-12 18:19:27,fumh1yw,t3_h7mod4,t1_fum1c2p,"&gt;Look up the definition for murder in the criminal code. The murdered must be a PERSON or a human BEING.  Morality informs law, not the other way around. If you want to use this ""It's the law of the land"" type of argument, then you're going to have problems understanding why we overturned slavery and legalized gay marriage. Pro-lifers are saying that the unborn SHOULD be recognized as having rights, just as slaves and gays were recognized as having rights. It doesn't matter if something is currently in the criminal code when we're talking about CHANGING the criminal code.  &gt;The murdered must be a PERSON or a human BEING. You can google what a fetus is, right? Or do I need to spoon feed you the information?  It doesn't take a google to understand that the fetus is a human being. For example, you have all different types of human beings: fetal humans, neonatal humans, gravidas, toddlers, pre-adolescent humans, etc., etc. The fetus is a human being, scientifically speaking. There is wide consensus on this in the scientific community.  Philosophically speaking, fetal humans are just as much of a person as you and I are. Personhood **cannot** be grounded in a property (i.e. consciousness) which can be lost temporarily during their lifetime (i.e. a coma patient/someone knocked out on drugs) or shared by non-persons (i.e. animals). IF that were true, then animals would be people too. If they think this, there is no point in speaking to them, because they cray cray.  Furthermore, personhood **cannot** be grounded in a property that comes in degrees (i.e. intelligence, brain activity, size, etc), because if you have a property that gives moral value, then whoever has MORE of that property, is MORE valuable. But because human equality is self evident, this is false.  Pro-lifers claim you have value by virtue of the kind of thing that you are, which is a human being. This is the most inclusive definition because it allow for animals to not be persons and for coma patients, dumb humans, small humans, unconscious humans, etc. to be equal in their basic moral worth. Humans are equal. It's 2020, it's about time we got used to that fact.  But sorry, this person is clearly not going to listen to reason. Have a nice day, and don't depend on other people's opinions. People are going to believe what they want, and logic/science will very rarely change their mind."

All free will suggests is that we have the ability to make meaningful choices, as opposed to simply being predestined by God, fate, or physical laws to act in a certain manner.    The only way it impacts morality is that if you really have free will, you can be held as truly responsible for your decisions, as opposed to you simply being a meat-puppet or an automaton."

Ectopic pregnancy is pretty much the only pregnancy complication that needs to be treated with abortion or can have fatal consequences for both mother and child.   Morning sickness and severe nausea can also be treated with medication and rarely continues throughout the whole pregnancy. So, needing an abortion for this instead of medication and a period of waiting it out until viability would be unconsciousable in most if not all cases.  As for estimates. That’s not real math so I can’t really do much with it. But the numbers even though probably an extreme over estimate still seems quite low considering how many abortions happen normally in an equally sized country per year.

So a person needing an abortion for their health is unconscionable.  Sometimes the person is allergic to medication or they don’t work. Medications don’t also work out. There’s not a 50% chance of fetal survival until 25 weeks. If a person is 21 weeks pregnant, they may not be able to wait an entire month to potentially save the fetus (and it’d probably have severe problems; it’s be 3 months premature). Vomiting causes dehydration and malnutrition, which can result in starvation. Not to mention if they have other disorders such as anorexia or diabetes or blood sugar problems.  There’s no reason to believe it’s an overestimation that I can see. It’s more likely from what I know that it’s an underestimation as people can consume medications or herbs at home to induce abortions, as well as have them illegally.  The reason some people (myself included) find the death rate relevant to the topic of abortion in general (including its morality) is because the purpose of anti-abortion laws is to force someone to continue to carry a pregnancy to term and give birth. That’s their literal purpose. People generally find it wrong/unethical to force other people to do things - like donate blood or an organ or run into a burning building that’s about to collapse to potentially save the health/life of another."

When you boil it all down, the real topic of the discussion is [personhood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personhood) - how do each of you define it and when does it begin?   &gt; Personhood is the status of being a person. Defining personhood is a controversial topic in philosophy and law and is closely tied with legal and political concepts of citizenship, equality, and liberty. According to law, only a natural person or legal personality has right, protections, privileges, responsibilities, and legal liability.  This is important to keep in mind. So when your discussion includes words like  ""human,"" ""person,"" ""baby,"" ""fetus."" To you, these are all the same thing, there's literally no differentiation. To me, these can all mean different things. A fetus can be human, but it's not a person.

Prophet_Aph,2020-06-13 02:17:48,funxscd,t3_h7qlue,t1_funt5p9,You made the assertion that taking someone else to an abortion doctor and paying the doctor happens frequently.

It's like me saying I have anecdotes of a cow barking often that doesn't mean all cows bark often.
Fetaltunnelsyndrome,2020-06-13 02:33:53,funzb3j,t3_h136vt,t1_fun12w6,"&gt;Severe morning sickness, some rare cases of hyperemesis gravidarum,   Hyperemesis gravidarum is a severe case of morning sickness.  &gt;and some cases of preeclampsia are treated with abortion.  Even treating preeclampsia is not normally done with abortion. Preeclampsia usually doesn’t happen until later in a pregnancy when the baby must be delivered when one or another anyway.  &gt;So a person needing an abortion for their health is unconscionable.  No, it’s not. But using ridiculously rare cases to argue for on demand abortion is intellectually dishonest.  Would you accept a ban on abortions except in cases where there is a serious and severe threat of injury or death?  &gt;Sometimes the person is allergic to medication or they don’t work.   True but also on the rarer side.  &gt;Medications don’t also work out.   No it does not. I agree.  &gt;There’s not a 50% chance of fetal survival until 25 weeks. If a person is 21 weeks pregnant, they may not be able to wait an entire month to potentially save the fetus (and it’d probably have severe problems; it’s be 3 months premature).   Again, rare. But still better to have an early induction and give the child a chance.  &gt;Vomiting causes dehydration and malnutrition, which can result in starvation.   Again, insanely rare. Honestly, I don’t even think there is one recorded case in a developed nation where this has happened.  &gt;Not to mention if they have other disorders such as anorexia or diabetes or blood sugar problems.  Perhaps those people with severe underlying conditions should consider sterilization. I don’t know.   &gt;There’s no reason to believe it’s an overestimation that I can see. It’s more likely from what I know that it’s an underestimation as people can consume medications or herbs at home to induce abortions, as well as have them illegally.  It’s an estimation. Which unfortunately does not give us any actual facts to inform the discussion.  &gt;The reason some people (myself included) find the death rate relevant to the topic of abortion in general (including its morality) is because the purpose of anti-abortion laws is to force someone to continue to carry a pregnancy to term and give birth.   No. It’s not actually. It’s purpose is to block the killing of another human person. Imagine the child existed in an artificial womb. Prolifers would still not be ok with killing it. An artificial womb isn’t pregnant or giving birth.   &gt;That’s their literal purpose.   Nope.  &gt;People generally find it wrong/unethical to force other people to do things - like donate blood or an organ or run into a burning building that’s about to collapse to potentially save the health/life of another.  No. I don’t agree. We force parents to do things for their children all the time. I have to care for my kids. I have to (legally and ethically) feed them, hydrate them etc. We actually as a society force people to do thing all the time.   What we don’t do, is allow one person to kill another person on demand and without apology.   To be honest though, I really don’t understand how what you’ve said is in any way related to maternal death rates and it’s connection to abortion?"
jdrew000,2020-06-13 02:34:16,funzcej,t3_h7qlue,t1_funq31h,So what you're saying is if you want an abortion Planned Parenthood is easiest place to get one?
PuckGoodfellow,2020-06-13 02:45:44,fuo0eqc,t3_h7qlue,t1_funzcej,"No. I'm saying the anti-abortion crowd made it harder to get an abortion and, as a result, Planned Parenthood might be the only option available."
jdrew000,2020-06-13 02:58:50,fuo1lp2,t3_h7qlue,t1_fuo0eqc,So abortion is not Planned Parenthood's main purpose but it's only option available for abortion for many. Got it.
PuckGoodfellow,2020-06-13 03:14:43,fuo31rc,t3_h7qlue,t1_fuo1lp2,"Because you made it that way.  Planned Parenthood is one of the many healthcare providers, but may be the only one that is able to provide abortions."
jdrew000,2020-06-13 03:18:43,fuo3f0s,t3_h7qlue,t1_fuo31rc,What's their main healthcare service?
PuckGoodfellow,2020-06-13 03:24:46,fuo3yp5,t3_h7qlue,t1_fuo3f0s,"~~Birth control.~~ [STI testing, then birth control.](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/uploads/filer_public/2e/da/2eda3f50-82aa-4ddb-acce-c2854c4ea80b/2018-2019_annual_report.pdf)  Abortion services are 4% of all health services."
NoNoNoThrowaway3002,2020-06-13 03:38:05,fuo55p4,t3_h136vt,t1_funzb3j,"I already know hyperemesis gravidarum is morning sickness on steroids. Either can induce dehydration and harm the pregnant person. It can even prevent them from keeping medications/nutrients down.  If a person gets preeclampsia before 24 weeks, it’s virtually always treated with abortion. In rarer cases, at 24 to 27 weeks, severe cases of preeclampsia with renal failure can be treated with abortion.  No, I’m pro-choice. Who decides what’s considered serious or severe risk? A lot of anti-abortion would say that a person has to be minutes or seconds away from death or have a 50%+ chance of death to “justify” performing a health and/or life-saving abortion on them. Waiting until a patient gets sicker can and often does harm the patient.  Abortions are safer than labor induction.  Are you saying you’ve never heard of vomiting causing dehydration and malnutrition or starvation in a developed country? The flu can do that. Uncontrollable vomiting from morning sickness or intractable vomiting in pregnancy - hyperemesis gravidarum can do that.  Um . . . there’s no such thing as a crystal ball in medicine. Doctors can’t predict if a patient with diabetes or blood sugar will or will not develop morning sickness or hyperemesis gravidarum. Also, a person could develop blood sugar problems - like gestational diabetes - during their pregnancy in combination with hyperemesis gravidarum.  We don’t have artificial uteri now.  By preventing termination of pregnancy safely and legally that forces people into a situation in which their only legal option is to continue the pregnancy and give birth.  You don’t have to. You could give them to someone else or adopt. Once they’re grown adults (18+) you can kick them out.  For one thing it’s related because if you care about life you should care about reducing maternal deaths."

Pregnant, out of wed-lock, crippled with fear and very young. Thank God, they did not go through with it.   That said, instead of calling them hypocrites, which of course by definition they are, I think there is a much more empathetic approach we can take here. It’s incredibly sad what the pro-abortion movement has done to these women and their families. They’ve conditioned people to think that there is a way out, an “undo” button, if you will. For a split second, it sounds tempting, thinking that your problem will go away. (Of course, we all know, many other problems arise)  What I gain from these people is that sometimes things are easier said than done, and doing the moral and right thing in a dark and difficult place is NOT easy. Women who choose life (even though it seems obvious to so many of us on this sub) should be applauded given we live in a throw away culture."

You may be aware that there are pro-lifers who also view contraception as an equivalent to abortion. It's not. However, those people have also continued the fight to make birth control harder to get. Yes, you're right that PP needs funds to continue any of their services. Whatever situational circumstances exist in each state - funding, laws, etc - if they can't afford to continue operating, then they have to close. Understand that any closures are due to the push by pro-life groups to limit their resources and services. There isn't a pro-choice push to defund them."

I wouldn't consider someone who doesn't have the capacity to be conscious a human being, but I would believe someone who is just temporarily unconscious but still possesses the capacity to be conscious as meeting one of the requirements in order to be considered a human being.   You're right. I shouldn't have lumped capacity to feel pain as being one of the requirements in order to be considered human being, but I do believe it's still relevant on the question of whether abortion is still moral, because even if we can agree that the one-day-old embryo isn't a human being, most of us would still be concerned if there were any pain and suffering felt by the fetus during an abortion.   The justification is that because it doesn't possess the human qualities required to be considered a human being, it doesn't possess the rights that are given to said human beings. And since the one-day-old embryo has no capacity to feel pain, people shouldn't worry about whether or not they are causing any pain to the embryo.

They do because:   &gt;One thing that really confuses me is how much pro choice people demand public funding for abortion clinics.   Pro choice people tend to be liberal/left wing. So they support the government funding services that provide a public good. They also believe abortions provide a public good as healthcare. So it makes sense that they would support the government funding a public good.   &gt;If it's all about choice then shouldn't the responsibility of paying for an abortion be all on the patient and not on the taxpayer?  If you can't afford an abortion then you can't choose to get one.  But it isn't about choice in that sense. Pro choicer people want abortion to be legal so people can chose to get one or not. Funding is a separate issue.   &gt;And even then, do healthcare facilities need to recieve federal funding in general?

Fetaltunnelsyndrome,2020-06-14 06:08:16,furzcpt,t3_h136vt,t1_fuo55p4,"&gt;I already know hyperemesis gravidarum is morning sickness on steroids. Either can induce dehydration and harm the pregnant person. It can even prevent them from keeping medications/nutrients down.  And?  &gt;If a person gets preeclampsia before 24 weeks, it’s virtually always treated with abortion. In rarer cases, at 24 to 27 weeks, severe cases of preeclampsia with renal failure can be treated with abortion.  And? Again you are referring to insanely rare circumstances.  &gt;No, I’m pro-choice.   So then why are you trying to argue your position using insanely rare circumstances?   &gt;Who decides what’s considered serious or severe risk?   Math, statistics, a panel of doctors.  &gt;A lot of anti-abortion would say that a person has to be minutes or seconds away from death or have a 50%+ chance of death to “justify” performing a health and/or life-saving abortion on them. Waiting until a patient gets sicker can and often does harm the patient.  Obgyns aready easily categorize pregnancy as “high risk”. It’s not a complicated concept. It’s called triage and we do it all the time in medicine.  &gt;Abortions are safer than labor induction.  By a slight margin. It’s probably safer for me to throw my baby who has the flu out into the cold and not care for or treat her but, no one would ever argue that this would be an ok course of action. Keep in mind that influenza has a similar chance of killing me than a pregnancy. I don’t see how the argument you are making is any different. It’s a ridiculous argument.   &gt;Are you saying you’ve never heard of vomiting causing dehydration and malnutrition or starvation in a developed country?   I’m saying I’ve not heard of a case where a pregnant person died of starvation due to morning sickness in a developed nation, have you?  &gt;The flu can do that. Uncontrollable vomiting from morning sickness or intractable vomiting in pregnancy - hyperemesis gravidarum can do that.  So can I kill my kid because she has the flu right now and it’s too great a risk for me?  &gt;Um . . . there’s no such thing as a crystal ball in medicine. Doctors can’t predict if a patient with diabetes or blood sugar will or will not develop morning sickness or hyperemesis gravidarum.   And yet they still need to make treatment decisions and practice triage with their patients. And guess what? A pregnant person is a patient but so is a preborn child. Both patients need to be considered.   &gt;We don’t have artificial uteri now.  So? We don’t need to have them for my point to stand.  &gt;By preventing termination of pregnancy safely and legally that forces people into a situation in which their only legal option is to continue the pregnancy and give birth.  This is what your argument sounds like, by preventing parents from killing their children when they have no way to transfer responsibility to another caregiver, you are forcing them into a situation where their only legal option is to be a parent. Therefore laws against killing your child is forced Parenthood.   And my response is so what?   &gt;You don’t have to. You could give them to someone else or adopt. Once they’re grown adults (18+) you can kick them out.  Imagine you are in a situation where  you are stuck with them for an acute time. You still have to care for them right?  &gt;For one thing it’s related because if you care about life you should care about reducing maternal deaths.  Who said I don’t care about reducing maternal deaths? It seems to me like you yourself don’t even really know why you believe maternal death is related to abortion."

Things cost what they cost,and the government funding and reimbursements go towards the costs of the procedures they are meant for.   Absolutely not true. They can easily move arround costs to make abortion be funde in part by the preceding visits which frees up money.  For easy math, say there were two visits, an exam, then the procedure. Let's say, that with no funding, they each would cost $100, totalling $200.  They could increase the cost of the exam to $150, allowing them to do the abortion at $50. The abortion is at a loss, however the amount of profit is now equal.  Never mind the fact that government assistance could be used to fund the buildings and pay for electricity, basic supplies which are also used in abortion, cleaners, etc which all lower the overheads on the abortive procedures.  &gt;This seems more like wishful thinking than a plan that has been thoughtfully developed and researched. And even here you acknowledge an initial drop. So I think in reality there will be more than just an ""initial drop.""  The lack of resources would be an issue, I agree. One that should be taken seriously. However abortion is an abomination and using the tax payer money of the unwilling is wrong."

For this reason, I believe in financial assistance for both options- public insurance covering either abortion or prenatal care and childbirth costs, and welfare and other aid to help bridge the gap for raising a child and struggling financially.  &gt;*And even then, do healthcare facilities need to recieve [sic] federal funding in general?*  Are we talking about Medicaid and Medicare, or something else?  Abortion is not federally funded outside of special cases where it is allowed (therapeutic abortion, cases of rape/incest), but the funds that some clinics (who also provide abortion) get are through Title X, and outside of the narrow focus of reproductive healthcare, lots of other doctors and hospitals may choose to opt in to provide care for patients on public insurance.  I think the general question here, unless we're talking to Libertarians or others who want to completely do away with government-subsidized insurance for the indigent, is to what extent medical procedures ought be allowed or disallowed based on ideological opposition to them.  This generally comes up with procedures that are in some way controversial- abortion, gender confirmation care or surgery, etc..

Although, I admit that there's a case against the disabled.  But again, you're extending the social contract to things that pose no considerable threat to you. I don't see how that just because all adults were once children means that children now are part of our social contract. If I met a child that could actually harm me in some way, I would create a social contract with him because of his ability to harm me, not because we ourselves were once children.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Consciousness for one, it isn't a switch, it develops.

Theoretically, if you were to examine the DNA of the sperm and ovum before fertilization, you would also be able to determine its (the embryos's) defining traits.  Not really there are literally millions of possible combinations when an ovum and sperm met. That is why people don't birth identical siblings even if they share the same parents. They settle into YOU after fertilization not before.   &gt;Yes, I understand an embryo is considered human, but I wouldn't consider it a human being. So when I say the embryo is ""potential life"", I'm saying it has the potential to become a human being, not that it has potential to become ""human"", which it obviously is.  I get the semantics of that but all this is mental gymnastics to exclude the embryo from the right to life so it can be killed and be considered ethical. We do that with all groups of humans that people want to discriminate before I don't support discrimination of any kind."

If I met a child that could actually harm me in some way, I would create a social contract with him because of his ability to harm me, not because we ourselves were once children.  First of all, I believe that human life has inherent worth. But it's a useless argument for discussion with pro-choicers because if someone like yourself doesn't believe that, then there's no further way to discuss the issue. I think that the social contract argument is strong, but I haven't figured it out in its entirity, I'm sure that my argument has holes (but I'm not too concerned as it isn't my viewpoint), so forgive me if it doesn't come across as clear. You're argument is helping me develop my own here.  Part of why we don't attack kids, is because we have a social contract with other adults to not harm kids. Which is where we run into issues. At what point should the young human be granted the same privileges?  For us, killing in utero is a breach of the contract, as we see fetuses as the youngest and most vulnerable. For you, no such breach has been made.  &gt;Sorry, what about them? I'm not exactly sure what you're asking. If you're asking me if it would be okay to kill them, well, it depends on the beings themselves and the society we live in.  Surely you would need to make a ruling as to how mpch consciousness is needed to be granted a right to life? Exactly how much? Where's the line?"

Even an embryo is alive and has individual human dna, making it an unique human life.  But you can define what is human being and what isn't, and even if it were difficult to know \*exactly\* when an embryo/fetus becomes a human being, it doesn't mean we couldn't draw some obvious lines, such as that at conception. Also, I don't see how just because it has unique human DNA means it's wrong to kill it.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Just because it isn’t morally instinctual to view a cell as a human life doesn’t mean it’s not moral. Some things you can’t base off of gut feelings, especially when we’re defining which lives we can snuff out and which we can’t.  But I'm not basing it off a gut feeling. I've just realized that an embryo has no consciousness, capacity to think, capacity to feel, etc, which are just some of the qualities I look for when deciding how I should interact with other beings."

Maybe don’t have sex if you know your ptsd affects you that much while being pregnant or get mental help while youre pregnant so it’ll be easier to deal with. Having a psychiatric disorder doesn’t give you a free pass to kill anyone.

NoNoNoThrowaway3002,2020-06-15 14:26:40,fuwjyzb,t3_h136vt,t1_fuvlr1f,"You acknowledge that there’s no difference. From your view: A person who consented to sex should be forced to carry a pregnancy to term and give birth. A person who didn’t consent to sex shouldn’t be forced to carry a pregnancy to term and give birth.  The sole difference here is whether or not they consented to sex.  I said,”In self abortions, the woman is the abortionist. So she should be punished.” You literally said,”Perhaps in this case. Yes.”  You want to punish people who have abortions. Please acknowledge this instead of pretending you don’t. This is about punishment.  Well, induced abortion isn’t murder, so, no, it isn’t forcing “murder” on them. The embryo or fetus doesn’t care anyway. Do you think if a pregnant person has a spontaneous abortion/miscarriage and their uterus contracts to reject and expel the embryo or fetus, their body/uterus is forcing death due to being non-viable on the embryo/fetus?  Your statement about safe, legal abortion being misogynistic is one of the most nonsensical statements I’ve ever heard . . . and I’ve heard a lot.  Why would I think they don’t? Because they access to data and information and trustworthy, reliable sources. They know that when abortion is made illegal, it doesn’t stop it just becomes unsafe.  Yet they choose to make it illegal. They don’t care.  I don’t even know what you mean by stereotypical pro-lifers.  My views on abortion don’t come from religious upbringing.  Define brainwashed and consider your own.  Here’s why I make the generalized assumption that they don’t care: None of them have shown an ounce of concern for people who’ve died in unsafe abortions (in my experience.) If they cared, they’d want abortion to be safe and legal.  How am I naive or confused?  What makes you think that anti-abortion men care about pregnant people/people with vaginas (and not just because they have a holy embryo or fetus in them)?  What do I not understand about the anti-abortion side?  I feel like you don’t understand bodily integrity, reproductive rights, human rights, and the actual purpose behind the anti-abortion movement."

No, I'm really not. I'm using the most common definition I've heard for these two terms. ""Human life"" is basically anything that is made up human cells/cell. ""Human being"" (or ""person"" if you prefer) refers to human life that possesses capacity to be conscious, capacity to think, capacity to feel, wishes or desires, etc, none of which the embryo has even though it's considered ""human life"". Regardless, we can use your definition of these two terms for clarity sake if you wish, and I will still attempt to show you why it's morally permissible to destroy a one-day-old embryo.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Two, I’m asking you to back up your philosophy here. Why is a human being and a human life not the same thing and why is an embryo not a human being?  Again, based off my definitions of human life and human being, human life doesn't always contain the characteristics necessary to be considered a human being. A fully healthy adult would be considered human life and a human being. A man who is completely braindead would be considered human life but not a human being at that point. In the same way, an embryo is considered human life but not a human being, and we have no need to feel wrong for killing things that are simply just ""human life"". Otherwise, we would be upset by the thousands of human cells we kill every time we scratch ourselves."

That would leave roughly 95,000/yr (and approx 15% of rape in the UK is of men), so you have roughly 85,000 rapes total in the UK/yr of women.

WaterIsNiceMan,2020-06-15 23:58:11,fuyiwwe,t3_h847k3,t1_fuuini2,"&gt;First of all, I believe that human life has inherent worth. But it's a useless argument for discussion with pro-choicers because if someone like yourself doesn't believe that, then there's no further way to discuss the issue. I think that the social contract argument is strong, but I haven't figured it out in its entirity, I'm sure that my argument has holes (but I'm not too concerned as it isn't my viewpoint), so forgive me if it doesn't come across as clear. You're argument is helping me develop my own here.  You're right. I don't believe in inherent worth in humans (or objective worth in general), but I would still enjoy hearing your reasons why you think we do.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Part of why we don't attack kids, is because we have a social contract with other adults to not harm kids.  I agree with you 100% here. We don't form a social contract with them, but they're still protected by it nonetheless.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Which is where we run into issues. At what point should the young human be granted the same privileges?  Well, I believe we already do give them most of the same privileges (we don't give them the right to vote, right to earn a license, etc), but he/she would earn all the same privileges as soon as they're capable of fully participating in our social contract as a reasonable adult, which I believe is around the age of 18 for most people. (But it could be younger or older, not exactly sure.)  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;For us, killing in utero is a breach of the contract, as we see fetuses as the youngest and most vulnerable. For you, no such breach has been made.  But I don't think you should feel any need to protect something that I would consider to be lifeless (in the ""personhood"" sense, not ""human life"" sense).  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Surely you would need to make a ruling as to how mpch consciousness is needed to be granted a right to life? Exactly how much? Where's the line?  I'm not exactly sure if consciousness is something that develops or not. I'm still on the fence. But assuming it is, and that everyone participating in the social contract were of the same opinion as me, I would only give a right to life to those whose continued existence would give society (and me as a result) some sort of benefit. It's kinda hard to say when exactly I would give right to life to a creature because it's consciousness isn't the only thing I look for when deciding whether or not it should live."

PTSD along with pregnancy can be very damaging to ones mental health, suicidal thoughts might have risen in her, although we don't know how she was mentally at the time but it wasn't good."
ELNP,2020-06-16 00:05:51,fuyjrmf,t3_h847k3,t1_fuyiwwe,"&gt;Well, I believe we already do give them most of the same privileges (we don't give them the right to vote, right to earn a license, etc), but he/she would earn all the same privileges as soon as they're capable of fully participating in our social contract as a reasonable adult, which I believe is around the age of 18 for most people. (But it could be younger or older, not exactly sure.)   And of course you grant the right to life to all healthy and born children right? We simply extend that within the womb.  &gt;But I don't think you should feel any need to protect something that I would consider to be lifeless (in the ""personhood"" sense, not ""human life"" sense).  Well, a neo-nate doesn't yet have a sense of self. Is it wrong to kill one?  &gt;I'm not exactly sure if consciousness is something that develops or not. I'm still on the fence. But assuming it is, and that everyone participating in the social contract were of the same opinion as me, I would only give a right to life to those whose continued existence would give society (and me as a result) some sort of benefit.

In that case are you okay okay with executing all humans who can't be a net benefit to society? All severely autistic people, all hardened criminals, etc?  If you raise a fetus, it's equally likely to be as beneficial to society as any other person."
Falconx28,2020-06-16 00:24:43,fuyltgv,t3_h93inw,t1_fuyjm5x,How do you know she had PTSD though?
madeline_200,2020-06-16 00:30:23,fuymf7j,t3_h93inw,t1_fuyltgv,"Because she said she did? It doesn't seem like she was lying, but idk"
WaterIsNiceMan,2020-06-16 00:53:16,fuyotxx,t3_h847k3,t1_fuyjrmf,"&gt;And of course you grant the right to life to all healthy and born children right? We simply extend that within the womb.  Assuming a newborn could be killed with no suffering felt whatsoever, I don't think I would always grant them a right to life. It depends on who wants the baby or not, but I would still believe most people wouldn't decide to kill the baby (even if they had the same views as me) because they just wouldn't gain any benefits from it. People usually form a relationship with their newborn, and this relationship usually only grows stronger as they age. And at the point where the newborn become young children, people wouldn't allow them to be killed simply because they enjoy the relationships they have with them and because most would feel too sympathetic to be able to kill them or allow others to kill them.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Well, a neo-nate doesn't yet have a sense of self. Is it wrong to kill one?  I think I answered that in my last paragraph.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;In that case are you okay okay with executing all humans who can't be a net benefit to society? All severely autistic people, all hardened criminals, etc?  Well, there are many people who are autistic yet are still fully capable of functioning in society, so I will just consider individuals with Down syndrome. If we were a society completely comprised of psychopaths and gained no enjoyment whatsoever from these individuals, it would be the right choice to kill them. However, since most of us are sympathetic/empathetic and enjoy our relationships with them, it would be the wrong choice to murder them since it will decrease our ""pleasure"" or ""happiness"". As for hardened criminals, in most cases, I assume I wouldn't want to execute hardened criminals because I wouldn't want me or my loved ones to be executed either if we found ourselves in a similar situation. But if there were some criminals who were just absolutely causing havoc on society and there were no hope of them being rehabilitated, then, yes, I would.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;If you raise a fetus, it's equally likely to be as beneficial to society as any other person.  Not necessarily. For example, imagine a single women pregnant in her earlier twenties who is attending school. If she gives birth to a child, there is a good chance she'll have to quit school, raise this kid on her own, and possibly have to require financial assistance fromm the state. Now, imagine this same women except now she decides to abort the embryo and determines to have a kid later in life. She will now be able to finish her schooling, possibly find a parter, and will be more likely to be financially stable. Years later, once she decides to have a kid, she will not only have made her much more beneficial to society, but also her child by being able to raise him/her in a much better living condition."
Falconx28,2020-06-16 01:30:20,fuysppt,t3_h93inw,t1_fuymf7j,Oh I didn’t see that part
Prolifebabe,2020-06-16 02:00:06,fuyvt2b,t3_h847k3,t1_fuydbzd,"&gt;Again, the embryo is not a human being. It is a potential human being. And why would you value anything that is human? Wouldn't that mean it is wrong to scratch yourself because you'd be killing thousands of *human* cells?  You are still not getting the graphic human cells and human beings in development are two different things.  &gt;The biology really hasn't told me anything different. I understand the embryo is considered human life but not a human being (or ""person"" if you prefer to call it that).  Biology is objective you are a human being from conception to natural death. The fact some people decided to ignore biology to arbitrarily decide who gets to be a full human being is subjective.  &gt;It depends on the reasons why you pick development. In my case, I pick development because that is an indicator of whether an embryo/fetus has the characteristics I would deem necessary to be considered human being.  Doesn't make it any less arbitrary. Specially since you are not picking it for yourself but someone else.  &gt;If your definition of discrimination means ""recognizing differences between groups of people/things and treating them accordingly"", then yes, I would believe discrimination can be valid. We already do this with animals. But please do note that I do not believe there is any justification for racism or sexism whatsoever.  I mean discrimination with members of your own species. If you don't discriminate based on race or gender why do you discriminate based on age? The only difference between a born human and an unborn human is time existing."

Also, it's not necessarily a bad thing to be a virgin all your life.  I do think that if you're having sex that could possibly result in pregnancy, even if you're using birth control, you should plan for the possibility that you could get pregnant."
Prolifebabe,2020-06-16 02:34:42,fuyzd33,t3_h9ul76,t3_h9ul76,"First she can get her tubes tied or ask her partner to get a vasectomy, or both.   Second I personally couldn't give two flying F if women have sex all they want. All we ask is for her not to kill her unborn children. We ask the same from mothers of already born kids even if they find themselves in the same circumstances any other woman decides are good enough to have an abortion Poor, abandoned by partner, and so on) and no one says ""If people would let mothers kill their toddlers women would be happier/have more money/their lives wouldn't be ruined"" do they? Same standard."
UltraGucamole,2020-06-16 02:37:17,fuyzmfb,t3_h9ul76,t3_h9ul76,"I think the reason it is relevant is because ultimately the man and woman are responsible for the creation of the baby (yes the man too).   Pro-lifers believe that abortion is murder. So it seems unfair to have the baby pay the consequences when the parent's actions caused his/her existence.  Suppose I am playing baseball in my backyard. In order to prevent accidents, I use a softball rather than baseball. However, despite my best efforts, I nonetheless manage to knock over and break something in my neighbor's yard.  I took the best precautions available and I don't think anyone expects me to never play sports in my backyard. However, when it comes to the cost of repairing the damage, I should be the one to pay. It would be unfair to expect my neighbor to pay since they were not doing anything and took no risk.  Likewise, a baby should not have to pay with its life if the parents are the ones who took the risk."
Prolifebabe,2020-06-16 02:43:13,fuz07ve,t3_h9ul76,t1_fuyzyg6,"&gt; What if the woman can't afford to pay for tubal ligation   She wouldn't be able to afford an abortion either so maybe abstinence is for her indeed.  &gt; or their partner refuses to get a vasectomy?   Find a better partner? What kind of asshole risk pregnancy on her partner if she doesn't want to have children ever? Even if you are prochoice you still are risking a procedure she will have to do on her body (and as ""easy"" as a abortion is I hear is not pleasant and can be painful) to keep you happy? That is messed up and any man like that shouldn't be fucked ever."
WittyComputer,2020-06-16 02:45:42,fuz0gxx,t3_h9pcke,t3_h9pcke,The best response to that is to send them back a horridly gruesome picture of an adult human brutally gored and say the only difference is the age.

PixieDustFairies,2020-06-16 03:48:21,fuz6jod,t3_h9ul76,t3_h9ul76,"Celibacy is not unrealistic. Plenty of individuals, such as priests and those in religious orders, are celibate. In most religions, the expectation is that anyone who is not married remain celibate, and for those who are married they may only have sex with their spouse. Believe it or not, some people actually practice the teachings of their religion, so yes, that means many people remain celibate/virgins. You don't need to have sex to survive, you can live without it. And there are plenty of even nonreligious reasons to abstain from sex."

sfielder137,2020-06-16 04:55:45,fuzcefk,t3_h8o7zh,t1_fuzbera,"So this actually reminded of a common thought exercise called the trolley problem. I’m sure you’ve heard of it. Five people on one track, one on the other, you have to choose what track the trolley goes down. Then there’s another one where you’re looking at five people on one track and the trolley WILL hit all five people unless you push some really fat guy off the bridge. He will stop the trolley but he will die. Do you push him? Most people would say no. This is because by pushing the man we are actively killing him, whereas pulling the lever we are inactively killing someone.   Kind of like with the kidney. I am not actively killing someone by not giving away my kidney. Maybe someone else will maybe not, but I am not actively doing anything to that person.  The difference with abortion is that, by definition, abortion is actively killing the fetus.   There aren’t very many good analogies for abortion because it’s such a unique situation with lots of variables, but as someone who loves analogies I genuinely love hearing these"
HarryStylesWife12,2020-06-16 04:59:58,fuzcqt6,t3_h8o7zh,t1_fuzcefk,"That was a pretty good argument I’ve never heard before actually. In my case, I would push the guy off to save as many people as possible. I understand where you’re coming from tho. This is the best pro-life argument I’ve seen I think.

A baby shouldn't have to die for you to avoid the consequences of your actions.     Long into short: it isn't dont have sex, its dont have an abortion"

Prolifebabe,2020-06-16 06:01:05,fuzhehe,t3_h847k3,t1_fuz879w,"&gt; But again, it's not a human being. Human life? Yes. Human being? no. It seems to me you value potential human beings.  It is a human being in the earliest stages of its development. So again not potential human being a human being.  &gt;Tell me, why do you think it's wrong to murder someone?  Because all humans are my brothers and sisters of the same species?  &gt;Also, I don't see how using these terms to define other beings somehow makes it arbitrary.  arbitrary means based on personal choices so that is arbitrary for sure.  &gt;I mean, have you seen any evidence that would cause me to believe there are actual serious differences between the races or genders? Because I know I haven't.  So that means that if you found a personal justification then you will discrimination is right? There is not an ethical reason to no discriminate for you even if such differences are found? The idea that if science discovered differences the logical conclusion would be to try to discriminate against others  sounds very problematic to me.   &gt;For example, if somehow an adult human being were to magically come in to existence before me, I wouldn't say to him, ""Well, you're only 1 minute old. That means I can kill you!"" I would treat him as I would treat any other human being. Age is only a very helpful indicator.  Except that will never happen. Pregnancy is a regular happenstance so this example is too convenient because is not realistic.   &gt;No, this isn't the only difference. Are you telling me the only differences between a three-year-old child and an seventy-year-old elderly person are the time differences between them?  Biologically speaking yes. They are both humans at different stages of their lives. The same way you are the same being you were when you were 3 than whatever you are now. I mean do you think you were someone else or you think you are YOU but at a different age?"

You've just been married after serving your tour in Vietnam. Around 1968 you decide it's time to start a family. You try, and try, and try again, just to find nothing is happening. You go to the doctor and receive the devastating news that your wife is unable to have a baby. Your world shatters.      Now picture this. Its 1971, around january, and you take a pregnancy test as your period came late and you recently had unprotected sex. The two lines on the test make your heart sink. You are pregnant, at 15. You dont know what to do and your scared out of your mind at what's going to happen. After consulting with a doctor he tells you about a couple who is unable to have kids but wants to adopt. Your overjoyed that your baby will have a good life with a loving family. And then the day comes. The baby is delivered, you share your final goodbyes with a daughter you will never see again      Back to the couple. You are handed your beautiful daughter. Born on septemeber 10th, 1971. You raise her and help her get through life and one day, she has a baby girl. Three years later, a baby boy. A year and a half later, she has me. Then 2 years after that, she has my little sister.     My biological grandma was just short of my age when she had my mother. If she had an abortion I wouldnt be alive. My mom wouldnt have been around to have me. Granted my grandparents would have found another baby to adopt, but I wouldnt have come to be. For that, I will never say killing a baby is justifiable.

But the core concept is that ultimately, a pregnancy is our responsibility because (with the exception of nonconsensual sex) it happens directly due to our own actions.  However, celibacy isn't the only other option--there are quite a few:  -Celibacy  -NFP/only having sex during infertility periods  -Vasectomy  -Long-term contraception  -Engaging in other sexual activity that can't result in pregnancy  -Some level of combination of contraception  -Adoption (as a last resort after pregnancy occurs)   Really, this is the same list of stuff that everyone can agree on, with a singular exception (abortion). My wife and I personally prefer the NFP approach, even though it does make for some fairly difficult gaps between cycles.

And treating people different according to their characteristics isn't necessarily a bad thing. It doesn't mean treating them bad or worse, just different. We do the same thing with animals. I don't see how this would be any different.  We are talking about justification for killing that is pretty extreme way of treating unborn humans and in the past people used to kill the ones they discriminated we still do, so I repeat with clarification.

Keeflinn,2020-06-16 15:27:39,fv0puba,t3_h9r9vu,t1_fuzapy4,"Hi! That conversation quickly went down the toilet so I thought I'd take a shot at giving you a pro-life response to your situation, especially since your post was respectful and in good faith.  The issue with the kidney analogy to abortion is that you (the presumed donor) are not responsible for the situation the person seeking the kidney is in. In abortion, the situation of the fetus being inside the mother is a direct result of actions taken by the mother and father (with one notable exception, which is an issue we can address separately if you'd like). In addition, a refusal to donate is different than actively killing someone. Sort of the difference between not rescuing a drowning person, versus pushing them into the water in the first place. Both are troublesome, but the second is worse.  To your second point, I'm not going to pretend pregnancy is a picnic. But let's look at it this way: when there is a possible conflict of rights between two people, we want to choose the solution that does the least wrong, so which scenario does the least wrong: a permanent violation of all rights of one innocent person, or a temporary violation of bodily autonomy of the other innocent person? (I do believe that when the mother's life is at risk that abortion is acceptable)  Anyway, hopefully that unpleasant interaction from earlier didn't reflect poorly on all pro-lifers for you!"

Its kind of funny how they claim to “love and support all women” but thats not at all how it goes when it comes to pro-life women and females in womb... many people don’t realize some men are only pro-choice because that means they get to have consequence free sex."

chucky144,2020-06-16 16:09:07,fv0vlbn,t3_h9ul76,t3_h9ul76,"Do you feel like it's reasonable to say that someone who doesn't want children should try to prevent it? I think we agree that it is.   We can agree that it would be better to prevent unwanted pregnancy. Where we disagree is whether failing to prevent it justifies abortion.   Consider what you are arguing for, for just a moment, from a pro-life perspective. Pro-lifers generally agree that the unborn are persons by the time pregnancy is detected. So just for argument sake think about whether it's reasonable to kill a person because you don't want to have children. I understand that fetal personhood is the basis of our disagreement, I'm only asking you to consider this difference of opinion when judging our arguments.  While it may not be realistic to expect people who don't want children to be celibate, it is an option, and one that will certainly avoid pregnancy. Even with good birth control, there's no certain way to prevent pregnancy when doing the thing that causes pregnancy.  I would say that it's unreasonable to believe that people have a right to have sex without assuming any risk of the thing that sex is the biological means of doing - making a new person. Birth control isn't magic. Not even tubal ligation or vasectomy are completely fail-proof.   Regardless, moral decisions are not limited to situations that we find ourselves in by willful informed choice. There are many times that the circumstances we are in are caused by someone else's choices or because we didn't know how to avoid it or simply failed to avoid it. What is right to do in response is not a function of whether we chose what happened.  Let's say a person does not want to be a parent, but a friend named them as guardian and passed away (classic movie trope). They have done their best to avoid being a parent but legally they are any way. Of course, they can refuse and let the kids take their chances finding a home in the foster system, but it would be murder if they killed them to avoid being a parent. So, even though they did not choose the circumstance, only one exit strategy is morally acceptable.   I know from the pro-choice standpoint a fetus is somehow different from the children in the above scenario. But if you're going to understand why we say, killing the unborn is not a moral way to avoid parenthood, you have to accept that to us there is no moral difference."

So from this we can gather that the foster system is screwed up. I've thought a lot about this and it's a bit wordy so buckle up.    If we stop the funding for abortion clinics to perform abortions and repurpose them for sexual education centers as well as places people can get free or at least cheap contraceptives, we can reduce the amount of babies conceived thus reducing the amount of babies aborted.    But there will still be an uptick in babies being born that go into foster care.    For this, we can take the money now not going to abortions and better fund our adoption clinics so that the influx of kids can be adopted by the current 36 to 1 ratio and even it out. Granted, there will probably still be some kids in foster care, but as kids come in, so do adopters, and it continues to flow. And for the kids that do end up stuck in foster care until they're 18, now we have less kids in foster care to pay for so we can use that money to make life better for these kids and implement programs to give them as good of an education as any other kid with equally as many opportunities.

I hold fetuses at a lower moral standard than I do a 20 year old person. Kind of like how we’re okay with eating animals, because we hold them at a lower moral standard. So for me, I think the woman’s right to choose is more important than “a violation of rights of one innocent person” because I hold the “person” at a lower moral standard. I do understand it’s a human life, but I don’t think it deserves the same rights as something outside the womb.

A more accurate situation would be if you were walking down the street and see a man a little further ahead and decide for yourself you're going to give him the million dollars.

Keeflinn,2020-06-17 03:22:52,fv34bm2,t3_h9r9vu,t1_fv2co14,"I think it's good to explore why we feel that way about the unborn. There's a pro-choice argument that brings up a sort of trolley problem involving having to save either a small child or a group of embryos. While I feel the argument has its own flaws, the idea that most people would save the child in front of them is largely based on our emotional attachment to what's familiar. We think babies are cute and lovable because we've seen them all our lives and are biologically wired to find them cute and lovable. It's what keeps us from dropping them off at a fire station when they're crying all night!  We are not, however, wired to find embryos lovable, because they don't need any sort of biological defense against the elements; they're (ideally) safe in the womb. But even though a fetus looks to us like a funny alien thing, it's biologically simply a stage of life of a human: zygote, embryo, fetus, neonate (newborn), toddler, child, teenager, adult. To me, it's not internally consistent to feel that human life has an immeasurable amount of intrinsic value only starting at the neonate point. If I were to draw a line representing the entire life cycle of a human individual, 98% of that line would be seen as highly valued by everyone, while the first 2% of that line would not. That's strange to me, especially since we often put even more value on newborns than the elderly.  I guess my point overall is that even though we're less emotionally attached to fetuses, I don't see a good enough reason to deny them the right to life granted to humans in other stages of development.

A lot of pro-lifers think the solution is to ban abortions all together. But it’s not going to stop people from getting abortions which in the end hurts the fetus more and risks the mothers life, more dangerous for everyone. In country’s where abortion is legal and the sex education is better, the abortion rate is lower. However, in country’s where abortion is illegal and the sex education is lacking, the abortion rate is higher even tho it’s illegal. In America, we learn abstinence only sex education. We don’t really learn about condoms, plan b, birth control, etc. If I were pro life, I think a better way to go about it is teach different forms of sex education, teach us how to use condoms, different forms of birth control, etc. and I’d also think it would be better to make birth control, condoms, and plan B free. After that I’d eventually ban abortion all together if I were pro-life. Starting at the root of the cause then making your way up to your ideals seems to make a little more sense to me. As a pro-choice person, I want better sex education and free contraceptives and stuff like that, but my end goal wouldn’t be to ban abortions, just to lower the number."

At a minimum, that requires them to care about their genetic legacy, and typically, it doesn’t stop at just that.  Well, not really, no. Believing that a woman's purpose is to bear children doesn't require you to value *anything*, least of all your own genetics. It literally just requires you to be a misogynist. It requires you to *not* value women. As for their own genetics, these are irrelevant except where it involves the woman *they* made pregnant, not the female sex in general, and regardless, the desire to pass on one's own genetics is, today, mostly a selfish desire rooted in self-importance and arrogance."

Keeflinn,2020-06-17 21:48:08,fv62byb,t3_h9r9vu,t1_fv3fgb1,"I think ""do pro-life policies actually stop abortions?"" is a valid question worth looking into, but the evidence we have actually points to yes.  The studies you mention that show higher abortion rates in pro-life places all use third-world or developing countries for their data. This is an error, as these countries are so different to first-world regions that they cannot be reasonably compared. Some are extremely impoverished, war-torn, have remarkably poor living conditions etc that can all have a very heavy effect on the abortion rate. [Correlation does not equal causation](http://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations) and all that!  So how do we more accurately gauge what effect abortion laws would have in the US? We can look at how the rate changed after Roe v Wade legalized it (1973), for starters: [it went up a lot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_statistics_in_the_United_States).   We can look at abortion rates by state and how permissive abortion laws are. The top 10 highest abortion rates in the US (via [Guttmacher](https://data.guttmacher.org/states/map?topics=68&amp;dataset=data)) are all from blue states (or in the case of Nevada and Florida, purple). [More info](https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/article_files/attachments/4307811-tables.pdf )  We can see where the rate goes after a [restrictive law](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264161212_Change_in_Abortion_Services_after_Implementation_of_a_Restrictive_Law_in_Texas) gets put into place.  Or we can check how various major European countries' rates changed after they each implemented abortion legality: [the spike consistently coincides with abortion restrictions being lifted for each one](http://johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/ireland/europe_ab_rates1.jpg).  Now, you might feel that's irrelevant if people still decide to get illegal abortions--after all, those wouldn't be recorded. And indeed, we don't have solid numbers on how many abortions were illegally obtained prior to Roe v Wade passing. But what we do have is [this](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00041486.htm#00001660.htme): “In 1972, 63 reported deaths were attributed to complications of induced abortion. Of these deaths, 24 (38%) were associated with legal induced abortion and 39 (62%) with illegal induced abortion.”  Of course, all of those 39 deaths were tragic, but when you consider the hundreds of thousands of abortions yearly following them, there's a pretty major gap in the numbers of deaths.  We don't really have much abstinence-only education in the US from what I know (I live in the very red state of Louisiana and I learned about contraceptives around middle/high school like most other people I know). But hey, I agree with you that knowledge is power, and while abstinence should be *encouraged*, it shouldn't be the only thing randy teens learn about!  Anyway, hope this helped address your concerns!"

In my school we only learn about abstinence-only sex education, and so do schools near me, so I’m sorry for assuming it was that way with all schools.   I think we’re our opinions differ and why we disagree is because we both think of fetuses differently. One thing I appreciate about most pro-lifers is that they see life even in the smallest things, but for me I just can’t bring myself to value the rights of an eight week old embryo over a women’s choice on whether she lets something live in her for nine months that can change her body and lifestyle permanently. Re reading that it sounds kind of backhanded, but I promise it’s not. I think why we disagree is because you hold fetuses to the same moral standard to grown humans, while I hold them to a lower moral standard than grown humans.   This next statement may be very wrong, so please correct me if it is! But I remember learning that life ends at the last breath, so wouldn’t it make sense that human life begins at the first breath? I’m aware that the fetus is a human life, but why does it deserve to be considered a live human with the same rights as an adult when it can’t live without using the mothers body?

Once we've done that, I can then persuade him to believe that an embryo isn't a human individual.

Fetaltunnelsyndrome,2020-06-19 21:48:49,fvdpx0a,t3_h136vt,t1_fuwjyzb,"&gt;you acknowledge that there’s no difference.  I acknowledge that there is no moral difference between a human being conceived as a result of consensual sex and non consensual sex.  &gt;From your view: A person who consented to sex should be forced to carry a pregnancy to term and give birth. A person who didn’t consent to sex shouldn’t be forced to carry a pregnancy to term and give birth.  No. That’s no what I said. My view is that there is a compelling legal argument for allowing an exception to an abortion ban for victims of rape.  &gt;The sole difference here is whether or not they consented to sex.  Yes. That is the difference.  &gt;I said,”In self abortions, the woman is the abortionist. So she should be punished.” You literally said,”Perhaps in this case. Yes.”  I don’t really believe in punishment as much as I believe in keeping the law consistent and acting as a deterrent.  &gt;You want to punish people who have abortions. Please acknowledge this instead of pretending you don’t. This is about punishment.  No. I don’t acknowledge this. It might be helpful if you just ask me what my point of view is directly instead of trying to interpret it for me.  &gt;Well, induced abortion isn’t murder, so, no, it isn’t forcing “murder” on them.   That’s like arguing that tossing an infant out of your home and into the cold isn’t murder. Also, the human fetus is killed before it is expelled and/or extracted normally.  &gt;The embryo or fetus doesn’t care anyway.   A sleeping person doesn’t care either. Not a very compelling argument.  &gt;Do you think if a pregnant person has a spontaneous abortion/miscarriage and their uterus contracts to reject and expel the embryo or fetus, their body/uterus is forcing death due to being non-viable on the embryo/fetus?  Perhaps but it’s involuntary and thus, the person is not culpable. So it’s kind of irrelevant to the discussion.  &gt;Your statement about safe, legal abortion being misogynistic is one of the most nonsensical statements I’ve ever heard . . . and I’ve heard a lot.  Probably because you haven’t looked very far into it. Look up New Wave Feminist if you are interested in understanding further. Abortion is a man’s best friend.   &gt;Because they access to data and information and trustworthy, reliable sources. They know that when abortion is made illegal, it doesn’t stop it just becomes unsafe.  Actually abortion restrictions are correlated with less abortions and better maternal health.   &gt;Yet they choose to make it illegal. They don’t care.  Who’s the they here?   &gt;i don’t even know what you mean by stereotypical pro-lifers.  Really? Old, white, Republican, conservative, religious freak and male.   And by the way, I am none of those.   &gt;My views on abortion don’t come from religious upbringing.  Where do they come from?   &gt;Define brainwashed and consider your own.  Being told the same thing over and over from a young age in order to get you to believe those things.   &gt;Here’s why I make the generalized assumption that they don’t care: None of them have shown an ounce of concern for people who’ve died in unsafe abortions (in my experience.) If they cared, they’d want abortion to be safe and legal.  Do you mean prolifers? I’m assuming you do. There’s a few things here. First, there are so many prolifers. Half the world identifies as prolife so it’s impossible to know all those people and their feelings. Second, an unsafe abortion is not synonymous with an illegal abortion. Look it up the WHO website is pretty clear on this. Many mothers are dying in legal abortions because of unsanitary practices. Thirdly, making abortion legal would not solve the problem and also kills 50 million people worldwide every year. Do you care about those 50 million babies? Why are you willing to sacrifice their lives?  &gt;How am I naive or confused?  Because you keep saying things that have no empirical backing and you obviously believe them to be true.  &gt;What makes you think that anti-abortion men care about pregnant people/people with vaginas (and not just because they have a holy embryo or fetus in them)?  I can’t speak for every prolife man on the planet. I’m sure there are all kinds of freaks out there. But I personally know many prolife men who care about women.   &gt;What do I not understand about the anti-abortion side?  I think what you don’t under is that we really and truly believe that there’s a baby in the uterus that is an equally valuable human being. And that killing people is not a good solution to life’s problems.  &gt;I feel like you don’t understand bodily integrity, reproductive rights, human rights, and the actual purpose behind the anti-abortion movement.  Perhaps. I tend to believe most people are trying to do what they believe is right. I think that prochoicers have a lot of empathy for women and pregnant mothers which is a good thing. But unfortunately, the disregard the fact that there is another human beings involved in pregnancy that also need equal protection and rights."

I agree that that we need to do our best to adhere to only the facts. Often what happens is that someone has a piece of information, but are missing other key parts which are needed to assemble the point as a whole.  Whereas we do need to do our best to only use true and complete information, nobody knows all that there is to know about the topic as a whole. Even with comprehensive statistics, much can be obscured by the methodology of their procurement.  I believe that the best course of action is to do our best to find the whole truth. Should that original commenter have been only referring to New York they would have been correct, and the values you cited would be incorrect in context. Similarly, should we be talking about the world as a whole, both values would be likely be far off.  In western Nebraska, where there's over a 200km drive to the closes abortion clinic, I don't believe it to be likely that numbers aproach even the national average.  I think it's in everyone's best interest to search for the actual nuanced truth, and not to point fingers with 'gotchas'."

Also, when I say it doesn’t care, I mean it truly doesn’t have any capacity to care at all - not sleeping, not passed out, not unconscious, not even lightly comatose, more like brain dead.  Do you realize how many abusers would love to force a person to carry to term and give birth so they can forever be attached to them and keep them trapped?  The Lancet says that abortion amounts are the same regardless of abortion law. It results in less DOCUMENTED, LEGAL abortions.  I was referring to most anti-abortion people when I said they.  I wasn’t brainwashed - I’ve done some researching and Googling and learned over the past few years to form an opinion on abortion.  Generally, when abortion is legal, unsafe abortions go down. Generally, when it’s illegal, unsafe abortions become more common.  In the U.S., death from abortion is exceedingly rare - less than 1 in 100,000. 700 deaths occur from childbirth though.  They’re embryos. Do I care about embryos? Honestly, no. I didn’t care when I was an embryo. My mom came first, as she should’ve.  But nobody has the right to use someone’s organs against their will - an actual born baby doesn’t have the right to do that.  Equal protection and rights would mean no right to use the body or organs of another."
NoNoNoThrowaway3002,2020-06-25 20:12:27,fvzn356,t3_h136vt,t1_fvx8sj7,"I thought I’d add this because you claim that abortion restrictions are correlated with less abortions.  “Abortions occur as frequently in the two most-restrictive categories of countries (banned outright or allowed only to save the woman’s life) as in the least-restrictive category (allowed without restriction as to reason)—37 and 34 per 1,000 women, respectively.“ So more abortions occur in countries that restrict it. They’re just not nearly as safe and undocumented.  Source: https://www.guttmacher.org/report/abortion-worldwide-2017  The Lancet, a peer-reviewed medical journal, says,”We did not observe an association between the abortion rates for 2010–14 and the grounds under which abortion is legally allowed.”  Source:  https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)30380-4/fulltext  As for your claim that restricting or banning safe abortion is correlated with better maternal health:  Abortion-related maternal deaths are higher in countries with the most restrictive abortion laws. We assess whether maternal mortality varies within and between countries over time according to the flexibility of abortion laws (the number of reasons a woman can have an abortion).  We conducted an ecological study to assess the association between abortion laws and maternal mortality in 162 countries between 1985 and 2013. Aggregate-level data on abortion laws and maternal mortality were extracted from United Nations (UN), and World Health Organization’s (WHO) database respectively. A flexibility score of abortion laws (Score 0–7) was calculated by summing the number of reasons for which abortion was legally allowed in each country. The outcome was maternal mortality ratio (MMR), which represented maternal deaths per 100,000 live births.   Compared to when a country’s flexibility score was &lt; 3, maternal deaths were reduced by 45 per 100,000 live births (95% CI: -64, − 26) when the flexibility score increased ≥3, after adjusting for the GDP per capita and five-year time intervals.   This study provides evidence that abortion law reform in countries with restricted abortion laws may reduce maternal mortality.

Comrade-Thanos,2020-07-09 10:25:28,fxeqtgx,t3_hns8d5,t3_hns8d5,"I always love to read stories and posts like this. It’s one thing to have been pro-life your whole life, because then you’ve likely grown up with the belief and had it handed down to you from your parents, school environment, etc. It’s still good of course, but it means the belief was probably relatively easy to adopt.  But in cases like this, you have to not only go against the beliefs of everyone around you, potentially painting you in a bad light if they ever find out (because of the stigma that many of us have), you also have to confront the fact that not only have those in your life that you care about quite likely made horrible mistakes, but you potentially have as well. Based on your mention of your brothers, sisters, and babies in heaven, it sounds to me like you know that your parents have had abortions in the past, and that you may have had some of your own as well.  If you have had your own in the past, I want to encourage you not to let the thought of this get you down. Was it a terrible mistake? Of course. Was it one that you made with a fully right, conscious mind? Definitely not. You grew up surrounded by the idea that your baby before birth did not matter, that there was nothing wrong with getting an abortion. While this doesn’t change how destructive the act is, you had no ill-intentions, you were just acting on what you knew to be fact at the time, and upon realizing the truth, you accepted it despite what you’ve done before. This requires acknowledging that you’ve made some bad decisions in the past, and that’s incredibly brave. To acknowledge not only that your viewpoint was wrong, but also that your actions in the past are wrong is something that many people don’t have the strength of will to do. I, everybody here, and especially your beautiful baby are so proud and thankful that you were able to make this decision, to accept this truth. So if you feel any guilt over your past actions, please remember that you weren’t fully informed in the past, and focus on the life that your strength of mind and will saved this time. And maybe, use your experiences to save other babies, if you ever get the chance. A formerly pro-choice mother is far more powerful and convincing than someone like me, a lifetime pro-life male, will ever be. Use that if the situation ever presents itself, and bring some good into the world for someone else with your past.  I hope this could be helpful. I’m not sure how you’re feeling right now, but often in posts like this there’s an immense amount of guilt over past actions. I just hope you don’t let guilt control or overwhelm you, and instead use it as a tool for change. You may have made some mistakes in the past, but they shouldn’t have to define you, especially when you couldn’t be fully informed to make them before and you realized the wrong as soon as it was shown to you. While you can’t take back what you may have done before, you’ve saved this life that otherwise would’ve been killed and can now advocate for others in danger as well. I hope you focus on this, and not on beating yourself up over past actions, because you don’t deserve to judge yourself based on them.  Stay safe, and good luck to you and your wonderful new baby."

Technically, one way of looking at it is that I have birth control to get access to medication that helps me with my disability —the doctors reason for not prescribing me the medication is that it causes an increased risk in congenital heart conditions for an infant born to a mother taking the medication. Even if I’d be willing to risk it, my doctor wouldn’t risk it. It’s also unfair to my husband that he is forced into abstinence so that I can take a medication to help my disability. Doesn’t the Catholic Church allow those who are married to have sex during infertile periods anyways (which is why NFP allowed, couples can have sex while pregnant, and couples where the wife is past menopause can have sex or where the wife has had a hysterectomy due to uterine cancer can have sex)?    My reason for an IUD was to treat endometriosis anyway (not the adhd)— which also (hopefully) preserved my fertility so I’ll be able to get pregnant with my husband.  Edit to add: also didn’t the pope say couples at risk of exposure to Zika can use contraception to deal with that emergency a few years ago?"

Take the Guttmacher statistics of [""About Half of U.S. Abortion Patients Report Using Contraception in the Month They Became Pregnant""](https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2018/about-half-us-abortion-patients-report-using-contraception-month-they-became) for example. The fact is that birth control gives a false sense of security and people think they won't get pregnant."
koavf,2020-07-09 16:05:35,fxfn64e,t3_hns8d5,t3_hns8d5,That whole story is a real emotional roller coaster. I can't imagine what it's like to be in your shoes but I'm floored by how much you love your child already. Let me know what I can do to support you.
Nondescript_Humanoid,2020-07-09 16:17:09,fxfoldu,t3_hnrlpb,t1_fxfmubp,"Let's be real here. Reporting you used contraceptive measures and using them right are two different things.   A lot of women who use the pill for example don't use it right, or skip a day and think they can just double up and be fine.   Human error in application of these steps is probably to blame for the vast majority of the resulting unplanned pregnancies.  It should be commonly accepted as fact that when you engage in intimate  relationships that pregnancy is among one of the many consequences you risk.  If someone truly wants to guarantee they will not get pregnant abstaining from sex is the only 100% sure fire way to go about it.  The thing is when you suggest that it devolves into ""Reeeee! That's not fair!""  Using multifaceted birth control measures, such as Pill, condom and spermicides (properly) will be effective 9 times out of 10  And if after all that you still end up pregnant?  Well, that is one life very determined to exist and it should."
duketoma,2020-07-09 16:21:21,fxfp4i3,t3_hnrlpb,t1_fxfoldu,"Yep. That's why I referred to it as ""real world"" use of birth control. In the real world people aren't perfect and they don't use their birth control perfectly and they don't get the 99% numbers that they're supposed to get from the effectiveness. People then make the shocked Pikachu face when they get pregnant and refer back to that large effectiveness number that the birth control is supposed to have and say well I deserve an abortion because that stuff said I wouldn't get pregnant!"

If a clinic has the 4 options available the pro-choice side will decry it and demand it is closed or provides abortion."

Planned Parenthood lies to you when they say that “only 3% of their services are abortion” because if you go in for an abortion, you also get other things like a pregnancy test, or they give contraceptives, those all count as separate services, even though one person got all three.

Prolifebabe,2020-07-09 20:02:50,fxghh98,t3_ho95c2,t3_ho95c2,Why are prolifers riding this train now? Is this an answer to prochoicers wanting abortion with no limits until birth? Extreme views have not helped us in the past they won't help us now. The life of the mother exception helped prolife countries to stay prolife the second those are threatened the public will side with the proabortion side because we all know a woman that almost died due to a pregnancy. Please stop supporting this political nonsense is just to make us look bad and give more votes to the Republicans.
Prolifebabe,2020-07-09 20:04:01,fxghmju,t3_hns8d5,t1_fxggrq4,I hope it ends for you sooner than later and that your rapist doesn't rape anyone else ever. *hugs*

Some types of “morning after” pills prevent implantation, which means it kills a conceived zygote. The common birth control pill prevents conception all together.

I think we can all agree that abortion is acceptable if it's the only way, but shouldn't we always take the better alternative when it exists? This has nothing to do with politics, it's just about doing as much as we can to protect babies."
Prolifebabe,2020-07-09 20:19:19,fxgjkq3,t3_ho95c2,t1_fxgj6ny,"The thing is the doctor is the one that should determine case by case what the options are. If he is taking too much time to abort the baby and the woman dies that is an entire family prime for prochoicers to convince that if abortion were legal their female relative would have been saved. Literally using every woman that has died due to pregnancy complications to justify every abortion law is their most used and successful strategy to keep people hostage of prochoice laws regardless if they agree with them or not because ""Some women will be let to die if prolifers have their way"". Is that a risk worth taking?"
nothing_special88,2020-07-09 20:25:07,fxgkatz,t3_ho95c2,t1_fxgjkq3,"Well, clearly he saw many cases and was able to determine options case by case without women dying."
Prolifebabe,2020-07-09 20:57:14,fxgo9cz,t3_ho95c2,t1_fxgkatz,And each doctor should be the one making that choice without the law forcing him to wait longer because he might get in trouble if after the fact someone decides he didn't wait long enough.

nothing_special88,2020-07-09 22:10:55,fxgx6wh,t3_ho95c2,t1_fxgtl80,"Maybe it's because people just aren't aware. After looking into this further I found out that at the stage of pregnancy where a woman's life could be in danger, an abortion is actually more threatening to the woman than delivering the baby because it takes 3 days at that point, whereas a delivery can be finished much sooner."
Prolifebabe,2020-07-09 22:11:56,fxgxbah,t3_ho95c2,t1_fxgx6wh,You didn't research fully then or your source is biased. Plenty of abortions are done pretty early on the pregnancy like ectopics.
nothing_special88,2020-07-09 22:37:42,fxh0b93,t3_ho95c2,t1_fxgxbah,"Ectopic pregnancy is a whole different world and I'm sure abortion usually is necessary in those cases, but I don't think a doctor would take days to figure out that an abortion is needed in that case because even those of us with no medical education can see that an ectopic pregnancy isn't one you can just solve. Actually, ectopic fetuses don't even live long enough for delivery to be an option. I would expect doctors to know this. I would also expect them to be able to tell from basic medical knowledge the point in a pregnancy where they can deliver a baby. Therefore, it should not be life threatening to women for a doctor to get a chance to decide if abortion is necessary."
Prolifebabe,2020-07-09 22:43:36,fxh0zu8,t3_ho95c2,t1_fxh0b93,See how your sources is biased then? Didn't even cover that. There is a whole set of complications that can arise at any point of pregnancy from conception to birth that can kill the woman so again every doctor decides if the abortion is medically indicated or not. Unless you think doctors are lying about women needed abortions to save their lives that is.
nothing_special88,2020-07-09 22:47:43,fxh1gow,t3_ho95c2,t1_fxh0zu8,"I'm not saying anything against abortions that are genuinely necessary, I'm just saying that I trust doctors to figure it out and in many cases there is probably a better way.

IDontKnows223,2020-07-10 01:02:52,fxhfu7m,t3_hoepm1,t1_fxhe8lq,"A lot of c-sections are actually unnecessary.  The actual percentage of “necessary” c-sections is between 10-15 percent, or as high as 19 percent.  There are many reasons why it is so high.  One reason is because more women are choosing to have an elective c-section.  A lot of the other reasons are more unethical and should be looked into and stopped.    C-sections should only happen if it is absolutely necessary.  But even if the c-section rate is high, that does not give us permission to kill people."

The answer is because you are forcing someone to suffer potential risks for someone else’s benefit.   It’s hard to argue you are against death and mutilation when that is exactly what can still occur.  And you’re ok with that.     Even if the chances are low, they will still occur.   Low does not mean not significant."
inohavename,2020-07-10 01:14:00,fxhgy58,t3_hnrlpb,t1_fxegsby,"I'd argue that it's more complicated than that.  Even without birth control, an estimated 50% of fertilized eggs fail to implant.  And birth control acts by reducing the chance of fertilization in the first place. It's as a result of that that the double effect of reducing the chance of implantation occurs.  Most users of birth control use it to prevent a pregnancy which they would feel the need to abort.  Not to mention the fact launching a war on all birth control isn't going to help the pro-life cause.  Do I think deliberately preventing implantation is right? No. But is it the equivalent to an abortion later in pregnancy? No, it is not. And that rhetoric doesn't help at all."

Based on the facts you report, you would be exposing the company to risk. Terminating an employee because she had an abortion violates Title VII, and the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) contained therein.    &gt;“the terms ‘because of sex’ or ‘on the basis of sex’ include but are not limited to, because of or on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions; and women affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions shall be treated the same for all employment-related purposes, including receipt of benefits under fringe benefit programs, as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work.” 42 U.S.C. § 200e(k)."

Aside from an abortion being related to a pregnancy, it requires employers to allow sick leave for women recovering from an abortion (it does not compel employers to *provide* medical coverage for elective abortions).   I couldn't find a reference to discrimination due to abortion actually being tested in court, but I think it's a pretty compelling argument that it would constitute discrimination because it's an operation related to pregnancy."

This of course made all the more ironic by the fact that you're posturing that you somehow have all the answers, even though you've demonstrated you know less than nothing, so here is your education:  Planned Parenthood was founded as an anti-abortion organization.  Margaret Sanger herself, regardless of her other character flaws, was a vocal opponent of abortion, which was in fact part of why she founded Planned Parenthood:  to help get rid of abortions by getting people to use birth control instead.  She was a birth control advocate, not abortion, and PP did not abandon its original mission and become the abortion mill of today until after her time.  On a similar note, let's just really drive home how little you know about even the topic of abortion in general:  Planned Parenthood started opening its birth control clinics in 1916.  Abortion was illegal until 1973.    Even ignoring their anti-abortion agenda at the time, imagine how truly and utterly ignorant a person would have to be to think that they were opening abortion clinics 60 years before any abortion clinics were even allowed to exist.  Maybe next time pay attention when someone warns you that you're about to demonstrate that you don't actually know something."

If they are getting dangerous hormonal imbalances due to a thyroid issue or something, that is a medical condition but it's the thyroid, not the puberty.

DeepGill2000,2020-07-10 05:06:25,fxi2wjp,t3_hoepm1,t1_fxi24vq,Yes I do agree that most of the deaths from pregnancy related issues are a result of inadequate care during pregnancy. More resources should be allocated to preemptive care. But the fact still remains that dying from pregnancy related issues is almost non-existent and nothing to worry about in a developed country. It is highly misleading to suggest that pregnancy can kill a woman hence women should be allowed to end their pregnancy or in other words take the life from an innocent human being.
ax-gosser,2020-07-10 05:07:54,fxi30rs,t3_hoepm1,t1_fxi2wjp,"This is simply not true.  Just because the % risk of death from pregnancy is small, doesn’t mean that it is not significant.    If you force people to give birth, the number of mortalities will go up.   That is a fact."

Like no shit, that’s obviously true. But driving a car is not a dangerous activity. Someone’s chance from dying from a car accident are really low. Should everybody stop driving? Should we make driving illegal?  What about the life of the unborn baby? **Every single unborn child** dies from an abortion. I guess there are no sympathies for the kid."

There is an understanding of how the human body is built to work and how the ideal human with no conditions, diseases, generic disorders, birth defects etc would operate. And generally nobody will meet that because a number of things will have gone awry.   No doctor or pediatrician will diagnose a child with ""puberty"". At best they would classify it as ""precocious puberty"", or ""early onset puberty"", to differentiate it from the natural developmental stage we all go through. And that is to indicate that it's not the puberty itself, but the underlying cause of the early puberty, and the effect it has on too young of a body, that are the medical conditions. Puberty, at the end of the day, is just the name for a bunch of changes that occur during adolescence. It's not actually the thing that is happening in the body, that would be hormones signaling to make changes, and maybe there is an imbalance, and maybe that is caused by a genetic condition.  Sorry, you are still wrong, and really reaching to define these as medical conditions. It baffles me that somebody can take reproduction, one of the key aspects of cellular life as we know it, and call it a medical condition as though it's something abnormal or going wrong. If it's merely the act of making changes to the body, then eating (another aspect of life) is a medical condition, which is the point I've been trying to get at. It would mean absolutely nothing anymore."

These cases are extraordinarily rare, and is the reason less than 3% of all abortions in the US. It would ultimately be up to the family for what to do in that situation. It would weighing two lives against each other. But that question completely irrelevant to the pro-life cause. The pro-life position is against the medically unnecessary abortions, in which the mother is in no danger.  5. Yes and no.

Mrpancake1001,2020-07-11 06:44:14,fxmbguq,t3_hotyur,t1_fxlguh7,"Sure. First, I would recommend reading [this article](https://strangenotions.com/answering-three-common-arguments-for-abortion/). It briefly outlines all the standard objections to the bodily autonomy argument:   - responsibility objection  - killing vs. letting die distinction  - the nature of the uterus  - etc.  There’s also metaphysical issues with bodily autonomy arguments. For example, the idea that pregnancy is some sort of bodily intrusion fails to capture the essence of pregnancy — the fact that pregnancy is prima facie a good thing.  There’s also ethical issues. For example, it controversially assumes that people get to voluntarily decide which responsibilities they have, especially towards their own children. But the real world doesn’t work like that.  I also think the pro-choice interpretation of [consent](https://humandefense.com/consent-to-sex-is-not-consent-to-pregnancy-a-pro-life-womans-perspective/) is inadequate and be cannot applied to pregnancy.  Another argument I like is the [de facto guardian](http://doc.jfaweb.org/Training/DeFactoGuardian-v03.pdf).  Lmk if you have any objections and I’ll try to address them! I know it’s a lot, but you asked why I think the bodily autonomy argument is weak, and there’s a lot of reason I believe that."

We should try to support these women in their pregnancies as much as possible.   2. I used to be pro-choice. I genuinely think that you come from a place of empathy and concern for people. The difference between us is I extend that empathy and concern to the unborn, which I believe are also people.  3. Perfect world would be a place where abortion isn’t necessarily illegal, but completely unnecessary. To do this, the concerns over having children would have to be erased. This world would have perfect support systems and healthcare for women and children.   4. In these cases women should be able to get abortions. The vast majority of pro lifers believe this.  5. As a former pro choicer I do understand pro-choice views. Though while these movements and beliefs mean well, they are inherently rooted in things like ableism and classism."

Criminalizing use of drugs was a horrible idea; selling drugs should be prohibited but it shouldn't be a crime to put them in your body. And again, no one can take legal action on you for attempting suicide (at least in my knowledge and my opinion. I don't think people should go around offing themselves and have talked people off the edge before, but if they did it i don't think they should have a homicide charge thrown at them for trying to kill themselves aka a human.) Masks are also not a matter of bodily autonomy. You make the choice yourself to go to places where you'd need the mask. If you don't want to wear a mask, stay home and no one can put a mask on you. Walmart is a privilege, not a human right, and people need to earn privileges that they want by making the necessary sacrifices. Similar deal with vaccinations.

What is hard is we do not have the technology yet where we can remove the mother from the equation without jeopardizing the life of the child.  By choosing abortion it is affecting another human being. It isn't a decision with no strings attached. But I understand where you are coming from. Why does the child's right surpass the mothers. Sadly there is no way where it can be equal. One has to win out.   In this case its a right to life vs a right to service. Some people value that right to life more heavily. While others value the service. For good reasons too. If we value the right to life of a child. Would that extend to strangers? I don't think it would be. While the baby uses nutrients and takes up space in the mothers body it is still encased in its own placental cells. So it doesn't take the mothers blood, or organs. The baby simply uses the nutrients and protection. But this has a dynamic affect on the mothers body as it altars their hormones and structure.  To some people they might be okay with abortion during the first trimester, but not the second or 3rd. Why? Then some people want to abort if their child has trisomy 13.   Sorry, I am rambling. I think I'll need more time to think about an appropriate response. Thanks for sharing your beliefs though.

Which, in this case, is the pregnancy. You can't relinquish consent to pregnancy and kill a child after they're born and the pregnancy's over, just like you can't relinquish consent for sex after the sex has ended, but if you're in the middle of the pregnancy you can relinquish consent to that pregnancy just like you can relinquish consent to sex during the act of sex. The two, though chronologically related, are two separate things you consent to and you can withdraw consent for one thing without withdrawing consent for the other. Pregnancy is a consequence of sex but it is not a part of sex, it is its own thing with its own consent. No exception is needed, consent works the same way in both situations.

ITriedSoHard419-68,2020-07-13 00:17:21,fxvq9er,t3_hpyig6,t1_fxv83ci,"It's alright, the rambling was actually pretty refreshing. It's nice to see people know where I'm coming from. I see where you're coming from, too. You're right, there is no way to end a pregnancy prematurely without affecting another life. I completely understand why many people are uncomfortable with the idea of abortion, even though I don't think those feelings should be law.  I would like to say, though, that I don't view the dilemma as right to life vs right to service. I view it as right to service vs right to bodily autonomy. The mother is serving the fetus by remaining pregnant and giving it nutrients and other functions that allow the fetus to live. Her body changes in many ways to suit the fetus and gives it nutrients, and the fetus does use her uterus so an organ is being used. A lot is on part of the mother's body, otherwise fetuses would be able to develop just fine outside of the womb. I don't think it's really right to life at that point, honestly. The pregnancy is a service unto the fetus. Right to life only applies to right to not have your life taken when you could live fine on your own, not the right to be served to keep you alive. I think the fetus is also relying on a service here because of what I said, so either it's a right to service for both, or the mother's abortion is less service and more right to control what does and does not happen to her body (like pregnancy). But once again, which one is more important still varies greatly from person to person.  &amp;#x200B;  I think there are a few different reasons some people are only okay with first trimester. One is that's a stage where most people I've talked to agree that fetuses don't feel pain, so they may view it as more ""humane"" than later abortions when the fetus may feel pain and fear before their death. Another one is the types of abortions that happen at different stages. During first trimester and first trimester only, pill abortions are an option. I've personally always had trouble understanding objections to pill abortions, because they are completely non invasive to the fetus. There's none of the graphic stuff, it doesn't touch the fetus's body at all, it just stops the mother's body from caring for it, which I think is fully within the mother's right to make her body stop performing a function. Some people may be okay with this for similar reasons to me, but be uncomfortable with the graphic nature of later term abortions and find those cruel. Even many prochoicers I know find descriptions of late-term abortions hard to read, honestly. Even when they support through all nine months.  &amp;#x200B;  About the trisomy thing. I can't talk on that particular disorder but I am disabled and I have a pinned post on my profile giving my views on disability-based abortion if you'd want more of my perspective on such things.  &amp;#x200B;  It's been really nice talking to you, and I wish you the best of luck on your pursuit of knowledge, I hope this response was useful and acceptable, and I wish more people were like you on both sides of this debate."

Does changing words really mean you are a compassionate person while you're on the medical table and tell the abortionist that ""I think this fetus might grow up to be ""Handi-Capaple??""  The second issue is a lot more serious. Margaret Sanger, founder of Planned Parenthood, was a staunch Believer and supporter of Eugenics, which (to put it in a simplified nutshell) is a socio-political ideology that advocates to achieve a utopian society through the means, by some sovereign entity, to select only the best people to reproduce, while sterilizing or even disposing the unfit, the unclean and the mentally deficient. Though there were small eugenic programs already scattered throughout the US during 1930's &amp; 1940's, the country that was the greatest national proponent of Eugenic programming was Nazi Germany.

Maybe there is someone at your school who has Down Syndrome and gets bullied? I cannot otherwise guess why you might believe that they all suffer.  As another commenter posted, nearly all of them are happy with their life.  And as for your comment that they don't know what's going on, you're taking a group of 5.8 million people worldwide and stating that they are all exactly the same - and that they don't deserve to live.  Well, two examples off the top of my head: 1. Karen Gaffney holds a Ph.D and has swam the English Channel multiple times.  Have you done this? 2. Chelsea Werner is a National Champion in Gymnastics and a Supermodel. She has appeared in multiple Target ads.  But, let's pretend for a second that they do all suffer. This draws a false line which can be applied to others - in the womb as well as those who have been born.  If we know that someone has been born into poverty, does the mother have the right to kill them? What if their child is 5 and the family suffers a job loss?  What if a 80 year old has to be put into a retirement home and will suffer because of it. Should their kids be able to rip their arms and legs off of their body and let them bleed to death?  You don't need to reply to me, just think about the false eqivalency drawn here.  Everyone has the right to life. Including my 5 year old daughter who happens to have both Autism and Down Syndrome. She had that right in utero and she has it now. She will have it when she is Elderly too."

wardamnbolts,2020-07-13 02:57:01,fxw5p8n,t3_hpyig6,t1_fxvq9er,Thanks for the nice response! For me personally I believe human life begins at conception as that is when people become an individual human. But I think the best compromise would be to have legislation to protect the fetus when it’s viable outside the womb. So I would not agree with current abortion procedures that dismember the body. I would like to see a procedure more like a c section.   The positive is you would have less issue since c sections are generally safer than the current method many abortions do where they dismember the body inside then use a vacuum to remove the parts. This method tends to cause a lot of hemeraging and other affects.   The down side to the c section though is you can only have so many due to the scar tissue and it’s much more invasive. Now I’m not a doctor so maybe there is another procedure they can do. Viability is pretty late in the game though I think it’s roughly 23 weeks. So by then it would be to large to induce it and have it pass through the cervix. But again not sure on this.  It’s been nice talking to you too! Sometimes people are frustrated and angry when it starts off. Like I’m not always nice if it starts off with “pro-life people are white nationalists” or other terrible things I’ve been called it can be hard to remain cool.   I just wish the sides would stop demonizing each other. When Hillary Clinton and others refer to us as deplorable it is pretty demeaning. Many people can be condescending in my experience. Not a lot of people are open to open discussion. So I really really appreciate stuff like this. I am always one for challenging my beliefs and refining them :)

rsnurse,2020-07-13 06:12:15,fxwlb50,t3_hq693w,t1_fxwjqof,"I just find it a flawed argument that people care so much about the pregnancy, but then turn a blind eye the moment the child is born. If you care so much about life you should focus on children already on this planet who are in impoverished areas, children who don’t have food in their bellies or a roof over their head."
lil_miss_curly,2020-07-13 06:30:46,fxwmimm,t3_hq693w,t1_fxwidr1,"Sure! If ruining someone's life is the outcome to be avoided, abortion would still be problematic. Not going through a birth canal doesn't change the fact that the individual inside her uterus is a living human being that would have to be killed in order for an abortion to be successful. That would not only ruin an innocent life, but completely extinguish it.   If we stand on the principle of intrinsic human value, which gives us our rights in the first place, then we can't devalue some lives for the sake of others. Both of their lives are valuable and deserve to be protected, so in order for us to be consistent, any solution we come up with must first protect a human being's very right to exist.   Now, with that foundation set, we can still offer a woman help through a crisis pregnancy. A woman's life isn't ruined because she has a child, but it has significantly altered and may even need assistance in certain areas. Wtv her needs are (resources, finances, food, clothing, counsiling, etc.), we can help her through those issues within resources centers and other organizations. It takes our time, money and attention, but there are clearly options out there that are far better than killing her child and sending her right back into the same conditions that were problematic in the first place."
rsnurse,2020-07-13 06:32:11,fxwmlya,t3_hq693w,t1_fxwmimm,"You’re assuming the woman in need would be taken care of by their society, which rarely happens."
lil_miss_curly,2020-07-13 06:44:08,fxwne2q,t3_hq693w,t1_fxwip0a,"When we juxtapose two human beings like this, we're seriously undermining the very foundation of universal human value and equality. This is not an ""either or"" situation where either the baby is valued as a human being or the mother is, and thus we need to struggle to put our rights above the other's. They are both valuable and deserve respect, and any solution we come up with to a crisis should work with that foundation. And yes, that should come with the understanding the it limits all our other actions and liberties because it would be self defeating and hypocritical not to.   As pro-lifers, we understand that the most basic right we have is the right to exist. Without it, no other right matters. Not even the right to your body, so we should never undermine any human's life if we claim to value and uphold human rights. So fundamentally, when we're looking for a solution, the existence of neither the mother nor the child's should be intentionally jeopardized. That's it. That is the line we're saying can't be crossed, and that abortion is crossing."

ree_hi_hi_hi_hi,2020-07-13 06:57:48,fxwoa0b,t3_hq693w,t1_fxwhu0u,"Can you explain why you’d need to look at their balance sheet to get an idea of their services/prices/costs/revenues?  Edit: Sorry, that was kind of a loaded question.   A balance sheet presents financial status at a moment in time. 2 situations: 1. planned parenthood only does gynecological exams and no abortions for a whole year.  2. PP only does abortions for a whole year, no other similar services (in terms of medical inventory usage). The balance sheets would look close to identical to the other at beginning of year and end of year in both situations, given other factors such as inventory and donations stay the same.   At no point in the year, in the preceding year, nor the following year will that day’s balance sheet give you any idea of the revenue being taken in from abortions vs other similar medical services.   What you are thinking of is an *income statement*. This is the financial statement which breaks down the classifications of revenues and expenditures. I will be generous, using [PPs most recent report](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/uploads/filer_public/2e/da/2eda3f50-82aa-4ddb-acce-c2854c4ea80b/2018-2019_annual_report.pdf) as an example:   Total Revenue for the year: $1,638,600,000  Now we like to be conservative when accounting, so I will say the categories “non-government health services revenue”, half of “government health services reimbursements &amp; grants”, and “other operating revenue” are ALL abortion revenue: $738,900,000  With those conservative figures, we’re looking at roughly 45% of revenue from abortions. (Including donations, but some of their costs are directly related to garnering donations, so I’m including it. Obviously, 70% of this example is made up anyway)  Just to add, even if there was a “cost or price schedule”, I’m sure it would not help you. Why would you need to know their costs? Their doctors don’t get paid by the abortion. It would be impossible to discern between medical supplies which go to abortion services vs not.   A price schedule only helps you if you also have the numbers of patients who are provided each service. Further, it is a non-profit organization which provides sensitive healthcare to people in need. Collecting that type of data is messy (as it should be, in my opinion).   Why throw out words like “balance sheet” before even looking at the report to see if there is one or “cost or price schedule” when you have no idea what to do with that information?"
lil_miss_curly,2020-07-13 06:57:59,fxwoaf7,t3_hq693w,t1_fxwfhaz,"I am glad your wife was able to get the help she needed to nurture and care for your child, and I hope that this will become more and more available for the ppl who need it, and to even provide more care than what PP currently offers. That is such an important service, and it needs to be promoted.   Unfortunately, PP is still mainly an organization that pushes and performs abortion, and not the vital care pregnant women need. We know that care can be found in a multitude of other clinics that don't promote abortion though, and we hope to bring those clinics up instead.   The government funding that goes to PP would be better spent there, and would even provide women and families in need with more comprehensive and affordable care. With that money they could further expand for easier access to communities in need, too.   So by no means do we want to take away prenatal care, in fact we want the opposite of that. We just don't think we need PP to do it."

In the situation of consensual protected sex: you keep putting your name on that list for good person points but not really hoping for anything to come of it. However if you’re picked, then you know you put your name there, so you go ahead and do it, because again, that person will die if not  Consensual unprotected sex: you put your name on the list and your fingers are crossed for a call from the hospital. You know you want to do this, this is exciting, of course when the call comes you jump up and down with joy, why would you want to say no?  Non consensual sex: someone else forged the paperwork to put your name on that list. You should be allowed to tell the hospital that you didn’t ask to be on the list and say no (in my opinion, I’m sure others here would disagree)"

In society, when two people have a conflict of interest where one person is incredibly inconvenienced, and the easy way out would be for them to kill the other person, it's still illegal and morally wrong to do so. Saving the fetus does not mean that you value the fetus more than the mother. It means you treat them both like human beings with the right to live their lives.  And growing up in foster care is still 100% better than never living at all, as many resultants of the system will tell you.

My uncle (didn't want me) physically/emotionally/financially abused me.  I believe my aunt only abused me emotionally and physically because of my uncle. Only one of their children has accepted me, the rest don't.   My sister was emotionally/physically/financially abused by the aunt who adopted her, we were all separated and. It allowed to see each other. My sister called the cops on my aunt and since my aunt ran a daycare she got away with it.  My brother was physically/emotionally/financially abused by every member of the family.   My whole childhood, I wished I was dead. I started my suicide attempts at 8.

You're weighing the value of a literal human life against the mother's quality of life. Sorry, but literal human life wins every time in that circumstance, and neither she nor the doctor have any right to kill the baby. We aren't talking about the government forcing people to have babies. We are talking about the government forcing people to not kill babies. Nobody is forcing people to have unprotected sex. Using the edge case of rape to prove a broader point is ridiculous and I won't respond to that kind of answer. When the mother's life is at stake, the circumstances change somewhat, because in that case, the scales are equal. But no, it is not a nuanced discussion to say don't kill people."

There are many community clinics, STI clinics, and other health clinics that provide these services at low or no cost for the uninsured. Honestly, many clinics, no matter what they perform, have special, free or sliding - scale rates for the uninsured, so it isn't exactly only unique to PP.   3. For prescription items like birth control, discount apps like SingleCare and GoodRx also drastically bring down the cost so that these prescriptions are more affordable.   4.

What I have provided is clear evidence that there are options that are free or low cost that ppl can use. Options I have used, and others I know have used too. So now, I will go back to my main point.   PP is not the only affordable option, and that there are a multitude of other organizations and government programs that could benefit from the tax money that PP is currently receiving. With that tax money, they could further expand and provide vital care while also not promoting and profiting off of abortions. By defunding PP, we would not be left without any options because plenty of local organizations are willing and able to fill that void.   I will also add that these alternatives are growing in necessity for those who rely on PP, because they have been decreasing their non-abortion related procedures according to their own [annual report](https://www.heritage.org/life/commentary/planned-parenthoods-annual-report-out-heres-what-you-need-know#:~:text=In%20contrast%2C%20non-abortion%20services,from%20660%2C777%20in%202016-2017.) for last year. That was one of the whole reasons that the previous president of PP, Leana Wenn, left.   In her own words from an [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/19/opinion/sunday/leana-wen-planned-parenthood.html) she wrote.   ""For me, as a physician, it was also simply good medical care to treat the whole patient. There were already some Planned Parenthood health centers that provided full-spectrum care. In one clinic I visited, a new mother could get a checkup while her baby was vaccinated. If she was diagnosed with postpartum depression, she could receive mental health services right there, too.  With high-quality affordable health care out of reach for so many, Planned Parenthood has a duty to maximize its reach. I began efforts to increase care for women before, during and after pregnancies, and to enhance critically needed services like mental health and addiction treatment.  But the team that I brought in, experts in public health and health policy, faced daily internal opposition from those who saw my goals as mission creep. There was even more criticism as we worked to change the perception that Planned Parenthood was just a progressive political entity and show that it was first and foremost a mainstream health care organization."""

As I was discussing with another individual on this thread, PP has even decreased their non-abortion related procedures according to their own annual report for 2019 ([report](https://www.heritage.org/life/commentary/planned-parenthoods-annual-report-out-heres-what-you-need-know#:~:text=In%20contrast%2C%20non-abortion%20services,from%20660%2C777%20in%202016-2017.)).   Furthermore, the previous president, Leanna Wenn, left because her vision of expanding comprehensive care and depoliticizing PP was seen as ""mission creep"" and not the vision PP had in mind for itself. Here is her [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/19/opinion/sunday/leana-wen-planned-parenthood.html) speaking on the issue.   PP prioritizes their abortion access over their non-abortion procedures, and those procedures are better met by other community and health care clinics."

So I'm being serious, can you actually say you are?  You can claim for a fact that you know that *everywhere* a PP is, that there is another option nearby offering the same (non-abortion) services at similar costs to that community?  I'm asking, because part of Planned Parenthood's mission is specifically to find communities which lack other options, and open clinics there to meet that need, so in many cases, the presence of PP in the first place is already a sign that there might not be another local option.  People in this subreddit decry this very fact all the time:  that PP opens a lot of clinics in poor disadvantaged minority neighborhoods.  The emphasis of course is on abortion, but the same facts come into play when the question is instead ""are these communities adequately covered for the non-abortion services?""  You are claiming all of them are, so I'd like to see the source for this claim."

The biological function of sex is tied with reproduction. To someone who is prolife consenting to sex is consenting to the possibility of life.

I'll borrow the rest of this reply from [this link](https://prolife.stanford.edu/theory/premise2a-4.html):  If personhood is directly tied to a continuous property, personhood itself would be a continuum. In other words, personhood would vary by degrees. Some persons would possess more intrinsic value than others, and the concept “3/5 of a person” would make sense. The extent to which one is intrinsically valuable would fluctuate throughout one’s life, and different people would have different amounts of intrinsic value in accordance with their respective share of the relevant property. This flies in the face of our experience with born persons, all of whom are accorded equal human dignity and basic human rights. Regardless of age, intelligence, income, homeland, and so on, we all have intrinsic value."

lil_miss_curly,2020-07-14 03:19:22,fy01fi4,t3_hq693w,t1_fxyor5c,"I don't think I ever claimed ALL of them are, so I don't know where such an absolute statement is coming from. I simply stated that there are alternatives that many individuals can use, which is a claim that seems supported with simple preliminary research.   There are databases that have compiled the locations of certain resources centers across the U.S., but there are also a plethora of other centers that can provide care too that are not included in the databases I know of, so a large swath of info is still left out. This of course still doesn't tell me the type of communities within each area though, which would be alot more research.   Also, since options available are often unique to each community, I can't provide a list because that would be, again, an insane amount of work for this type of discussion. So these are far from random claims, but can easily be found through a simple Google search of your areas resources (STI clinics, health clinics, community health clinics, pregnancy resource centers).  None the less, even the resignation of PPs previous president Leanna Wenn seems to settle the issue that PP is less concerned about comprehensive health care, and more concerned with pushing abortions ([source](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/19/opinion/sunday/leana-wen-planned-parenthood.html)).   Finally, I'm all for expanding access to such care, but excusing the heinous actions PP promotes and provides, simply because they offer affordable testing and contraceptives, is abhorrent. I will gladly work harder to promote alternative options and expand them into areas with limited access if need be, but not at the expense of human lives. This isn't an either or issue and shouldn't be treated as one."

It's a tall order to fill, and I can't really meet it in these anonymous circumstances.   All I do know is that there are other options for many ppl, and they tend to be widely available. It's just a matter of finding them, which is much harder than finding a PP since they already get so much free press. Plus, they have a large budget for the not so free press, too.   I also know that no amount of good services should excuse, or cause us to turn a blind eye to the killing of innocent human beings, though.   If PP stopped all their abortions, then we wouldn't have a problem with them. But as it still stands, even the resignation of the previous PP president Leanna Wenn highlights their current mission to expand abortion over that of comprehensive care ([source](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/19/opinion/sunday/leana-wen-planned-parenthood.html)).

I don't think anyone is disagrees on the fact that sex can lead to pregnancy, rather I think pro-choicers and pro-lifers disagree on what that means on the abortion debate ground.   However, your comment does contain a few strange assertations, such as:  &gt;I'm not consenting to the possibility  I don't know how one would define consent if not a fully-informed decision made about an action/activity. In order to properly consent to an activity, you must be aware of *all* the risks engaging in the activity may result in, even the ones you're trying to avoid. A person may take steps to avoid a risk, for example, but if that risk comes to pass, and they are the most responsible party, they're responsible for the result. Pro-choicers and pro-lifers may disagree on what that responsibility means, but that doesn't mean it isn't there."

The reason so many pro choicers truly to deny that the fetus is alive or human or innocent, is because they do value innocent human life over bodily autonomy but they still want people to be able to get abortions.

Like you say, it’s based on whether it’s morally acceptable to kill an unborn child. Pro-Lifers say it’s murder and Pro-Choicers say what they say (not a person, not murder).   There are lots of things that we do in society that I still don’t agree upon and I think some of us try to make justifications based on our own personal belief.   On other issues: Some say if you eat animal meat/products you are contributing to the abuse of animals. Vegans hold the life of animals to be important. Non-Vegans don’t see/agree that the value of animals is equivalent to humans and/or refuse to see that animals also deserve to live and we as humans should reduce are animals consumption. Is it morally acceptable to eat animals and thus contribute to the killing of animals?  Vegans would completely  disagree with you if you say yes.   States with castle type doctrines (and  situations for non-violent crime): is it morally acceptable to kill/murder an unarmed intruder that you encounter and that is in the process of running away from you and your home but is still on your property. Some say yes, if they are on your property they deserve to be killed since they committed a crime and you have the right to defend your property (I seen comments by pro-lifers that say this is acceptable because an innocent unborn child is different than a born person that committed a crime).  My view is if they are no longer a threat to you and are running away, murdering them is not an option. You are basically saying it’s ok to kill someone if they are no longer a threat and/or for  the crime of theft. Is property more valuable than human life? If we make justifications for the killing of humans for non life threatening situations we don’t truly value human life.   We often try to make justifications as to what is morally acceptable or not. Unfortunately, not everyone agrees on the value of human life.  Some has said that killing an unborn child in an abortion is not murder.  This way of thinking shouldn’t be a surprise given the fact that humans try to make any justification based on their own personal belief and situation.   Is human life important (whether innocent or not)? If you believe that humans can be killed/murdered depending on the situation (non-life threatening situations and/or even if eg during war where innocents must die (collateral damage) “for the greater good”) then you have to accept that there will always be people that will believe that killing an unborn child is not murder.   It’s all a matter of whether the killing of humans can be justified (no matter the situation) and pro-choices have always try to maintain their reasons for not holding an unborn child’s life important."

Just because something has a moral side to debate, does not make the argument any less valid.  If someone said we should all be able to kill anyone we don’t like or steal from others or what have you, the argument against that would be a moral one. We don’t do those things because they are morally wrong.  Most people would agree things like lying, cheating, stealing, harming others, rape, etc are wrong. Morally wrong.  There may be a scientific reason not to do those things, but in general the reason we are against those is because they are wrong. And that’s enough. There is certainly a scientific argument to be made, but the moral one should not be discounted. My point is there are plenty of other things people accept as morally wrong and are satisfied at that.  Why is this any different?"

First of all, I'm not really for late term abortions, and I don't really think they happen that often as prolife try and imply they do. I say birth because it avoids slippery slope problems. Whether an abortion should take place late term or not should really be a medical decision, not a legal one.  Birth is of massive cultural importance, it is the first time the baby can live independently of the mothers body. It is when we culturally agree that this human becomes a person, it receives a birth certificate, a birth date, usually a name, and starts it's medial history.  It's simply a sensible point at which a human life becomes a person by default. I also believe that personhood can get bestowed and removed onto a fetus at any time by the mother."

Wouldn't it make more sense to have an *objective* standard about what humans are, such as having individual human DNA? What are your problems with having objective standards of what human beings are?   And the pro-choice movement has been moving goal posts about what they considered life for the past 50 years at least. First it was heartbeat, then it was brain waves, then it was pain, then it was viable outside the womb, and now there's an extremely vocal part of the movement pushing for abortion at any week for any reason.

I don't believe I said they were less than human, I said they weren't people. Biologically they're as human as you or I, they're just not as developed. I'm not going to debate that.  We can't apply objective standards to the abortion debate because it's a philosophical debate, not a scientific one. From a scientific perspective I don't think we'd disagree on anything.  You're also using the term ""human being"" a lot you need to define what that means before I can comment on it. I feel the term ""human being"" separates something that's biologically human from something that has personhood.

It requires a lot of extra attention and interaction. Plus, no matter how old she gets she will never fully be an independent adult able to function on her own. She will never marry, never have kids, never have an actual normally paying job. Most importantly, someone will always need to care for her. When my stepmother passes, I don't know who will care for her then. My wife and I have children of our own. We've spoke at length about it and while I've agonized over this decision,, my sisters outbursts and special care needed just would not be a match for our household. (Note: that ultimate decision was mine, not my wife's. She's not the bad person here, I am if thats your summation) I know the state can and would take her, but what kind of life is that for her after living with my stepmother? So I can understand why parents wouldn't want to have a T21 child. They would never have a point in their life where they weren't caring for their child. No ""golden years"" of retirement. And even when they're retired, they still would need to worry about who will care for that child when they're gone. Its a big ask for anyone and a difficult decision to make.

wardamnbolts,2020-07-14 18:00:32,fy250u8,t3_hqsreb,t1_fy0vcjk,I think the biggest difference is pro-life side sees the unborn as having humanity. While most of the pro-choice side doesn’t. That’s why the pro-life side appeals to science as science backs up that the fetus is a human individual. Because they are a human individual we believe they have a right to life.   The big issue is does the baby have a right to use the mother’s body if that mother doesn’t want to be a parent. By dehumanizing the unborn it becomes an easy yes. But recognizing the unborn as being human and having rights makes it muddy in my opinion.   We don’t force people to give blood or provide nutrients to others. Parenthood is a choice since we have adoption. So to me that has been the most compelling argument on the pro-choice side recognizing it is human but violating the rights of the mother. If we deem parenthood a choice.

But it sounds like you're expecting me to give you a scientific answer to a philosophical question.  It's basically the same as asking me why, when someone turns 18, they're considered a legal adult, but 1 day before they were not.  We have to draw the line somewhere, and the further you go back, the less and less people would agree. For example, the idea that an embryo in a fertility clinic should be treated as a baby is laughable to most people who're on the fence. But as a fetus gets older and older more and more people will move towards the prolife side of the fence.  For me, and I believe a lot of prochoicers agree, that from a legal standpoint, abortion shouldn't be illegal at any point of the pregnancy, however, when it comes to late term abortions, they should be limited in other ways.  But legally, it I think has to be conception, or birth. I don't think there can be anything in between, so given the choice I choose birth."

My line of thinking is based on what the consequences of each of the options presented are, seeking to do the least harm possible. If you're right, and personhood is only in effect at birth, then abortion is fine, but restricting its application to earlier in the pregnancy doesn't significantly harm anyone. On the other hand, if personhood is in effect at conception, then permitting abortion at any stage means people are being killed so that other people can live more pleasant lives. That's a tragedy I'd rather avoid entirely. Even if personhood comes about at a later stage of development, granting human rights to what will later develop into a human being leads to no human person being killed by a misjudgment of where that line is."

If by personhood you mean have human rights then yeah that's what is currently being debated for sure. Individual doesn't necessarily imply personhood it just implies an unique or separate being.

Let's say you and your partner agree to have sex -- and you decide to use contraceptives. If your partner sabatoges the condom(therefore increasing the risk of pregnancy or contracting any STDs your partner may carry), would it impact your decision to have sex with them? Why or why not?   &gt;Consent means agreeing to something. Agreeing to one thing does not mean agreeing to another.   The fact that you've said this frustrates me, because it makes me feel as if you're not reading anything I've said.  &gt;I consent to go up to your place for a drink, but I don't consent to have sex with you. Assuming consent to one thing means consent to all the things is rapey territory.  Yes, because agreeing to sex is a seperate action that requires seperate consent. Pregnancy is an outcome, and you can't consent to outcomes, only consent to a activity that risks that outcome.  &gt;Okay? I take responsibility for any unplanned pregnancies by having an abortion.

That being said, we want it to be considered murder because it is killing innocent human beings, but the fact that it is not legally punishable by law doesn't change the issue of human rights no more than it does/did in arguements against slavery. The law was wrong, and it needed to be changed."
allgespraeche,2020-07-28 14:54:40,fzin7jt,t3_hq693w,t1_fzgft3w,"But why is the law wrong? Which human right is involved there? Why do you belief a woman has less rights to her body then a fetus/embryo?   Also. Yall calling it murder and baby is just emotion/feelings over facts. Because removing a fetus sounds less horrific then saying you are ""killing/murdering a baby"""
lil_miss_curly,2020-07-29 04:07:19,fzl768q,t3_hq693w,t1_fzin7jt,"The law is wrong because it allows for the intentional and institutionalized killing of an innocent human being because they are unwanted by another person. Which would mean the human right being violated is the most basic right to life, and the intrinsic value a human being has which protects human life in the first place. Abortion violates this plainly because it allows one person to determine the value of the existence of another human being, and therefore whether that human being deserves to live.   It is not either/or. We do not believe a woman has less rights, but that they both fundamentally have an equal right to their life, to exist, as a human being with their own value. Without that right first, a right to your body is impossible. With that in mind,  killing a human in the womb requires you to violate their body by imposing a life ending procedure on them, so if anyone is saying one life is more valuable than the other's, it is abortion supporters   Now, calling it killing a child/baby is simply calling it for what it is based off of the facts. It is alive, it is a human being, and it has to be killed in order for an abortion to be successful. That's undeniable.   Sterilizing the act of killing a child by using words like ""fetus"" or ""termination of pregnancy"" to try and make it sound more palatable shows more of the process of dehumanization that is being implemented by abortion advocates. That alone is hiding the facts and not supporting them.  No one would accuse someone of ignoring facts for emotions because they said a 3yr old child was murdered. Those are facts, and those facts can be emotionally disturbing, but it does not detract from the truth of what happened because there is an emotional response."

Monim5,2020-08-07 18:55:10,g0pkfc0,t3_hq693w,t1_fxyfw2d,I'd like to hear your response to the reply below
lil_miss_curly,2020-08-08 05:16:29,g0rg9o6,t3_hq693w,t1_g0pkfc0,"I think I responded on a different thread that we were talking in on here. Anyway, my answer is ultimately along the same lines as the theme of the meme and replies.   I will say first that I cannot verify their claims or see what is in their area in anyway. Especially with comments such as eradicating crisis pregnancy centers, I'm left with doubts abt their views abt alternative options that are not PP.  At any rate, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume alternative options that I listed are limited or require a drive &amp; planning. That limitation does not therefore justify the actions of PP in regards to abortion services. PP is responsible for the deaths of millions of ppl. No amount of birth control or mammogram referrals could make that acceptable, and it shouldn't.   The value of human life is not contextual. We don't get to pick and choose when it's worth protecting. That means that at the very LEAST we can't kill ppl because we choose to. That fact abt human worth can in turn guide us to help and support other human life that struggles/needs assistance because they lack access to basic resources/services, but it cannot guide us to extinguishing some lives in the process.   So I will gladly support keeping PP if they stop abortions, or transferring social support to alternative clinics that could better use that funding to expand and aide isolated communities, but we should not ignore the serious problems going on in a clinic simply because they provide certain services in an area with limited access.   Furthermore, I will highlight that PP can be replaced, and they know it. If that wasn't true, if PP was a monopoly with no competition, they'd have no need to advertise, donate, campaign or lobby the way that they do."

If you can prove that the employee is incompetent, that's one thing but just because she had an abortion is something entirely different. Plus how would you know? That's certainly not something I would share with my employer either before or after."

bfangPF1234,2021-12-14 03:56:38,hogwm0v,t3_h0ls2z,t1_ftmwgth,It will happen regardless.  You would rather have teens have sex and not get pregnant than have lots of teen parents
bfangPF1234,2021-12-14 03:57:06,hogwo3o,t3_h0ls2z,t1_ftn9ut6,"Yea people married younger, a pretty bad thing for modern society"
bfangPF1234,2021-12-14 03:58:29,hogwuin,t3_h0ls2z,t1_ftq076l,Contraception merely limits the risk of a negative consequence to a reckless activity teens will pursue regardless. In either world teens will have sex.  You’d rather it be safe and not produce too many kids.
bfangPF1234,2021-12-14 03:59:35,hogwzjt,t3_h0ls2z,t1_ftnb4vq,The country should pay to reduce unplanned pregnancy right?
PixieDustFairies,2021-12-14 06:20:11,hohc2io,t3_h0ls2z,t1_hogwuin,"I have gone through the teenagers years and not be sexually active. To say that it will happen regardless sounds like it's not a choice, and it absolutely is. You need to expect teenagers to make responsible choices, like not sleeping around with guys from high school and not texting while driving or purchasing alchohol. Some teens do it regardless, but telling them that it's okay only puts more people at risk. Should we also get rid of the drinking age because teens will just buy alchohol anyway, or get rid of laws banning texting and driving because they will just do it anyway?"
PixieDustFairies,2021-12-14 06:21:43,hohc7jl,t3_h0ls2z,t1_hogwo3o,It completely depends on the maturity level of the people involved. People were given more responsibilities many years ago and were expected to be mature at a younger age.
PixieDustFairies,2021-12-14 06:23:49,hohced4,t3_h0ls2z,t1_hogwm0v,"I would rather teenagers abstain from sex until they are married. That is also a choice, it's not either do contraception or get pregnant. Also teenagers can still get pregnant even with contraception. So what else should they have done to not get pregnant even if they were trying to not get pregnant? The whole plot of the movie Unpregnant is about a girl who goes behind her parents' backs to get an abortion because her contraception failed."
bfangPF1234,2021-12-14 06:24:59,hohci6c,t3_h0ls2z,t1_hohc7jl,Well today communities with high rates of teen parentage have higher rates of poverty and lower education levels.
bfangPF1234,2021-12-14 06:27:08,hohcp1r,t3_h0ls2z,t1_hohc2io,"No but you wouldn’t make it more dangerous for teens to drink or to text while driving right?  If you’re going to text and drive you shouldn’t also take your seatbelt off.  Also it’s possible to want to be child free past your teens, so nothing wrong with telling people at least the contraception is available and making them educated in its use."
bfangPF1234,2021-12-14 06:28:18,hohcsqt,t3_h0ls2z,t1_hohced4,"Right but the chances are much lower, it is my hope that one day 100 percent effective contraception will be made, but half the religious nutjobs in this sub would go crazy for some dumb reason."

questionshere123,2022-07-01 18:32:02,iehf1qr,t3_h8w9fu,t1_fuzax6u,What is an inadvertent abortion? If someone is taking plan b they don’t want to get pregnant
OhNoTokyo,2022-07-01 19:08:01,iehk9d8,t3_h8w9fu,t1_iehf1qr,"A termination of pregnancy that they caused, but did not intend.  The problem is, some people might take Plan B because they believe it only prevents them from getting pregnant.  If they thought it would end a pregnancy already in progress, they would not use it.  A pro-lifer would have that view, for instance.  If I was confident that Plan B only prevented fertilization, I'd be fine with it.  If I can't be sure it won't terminate a pregnancy, however, I am not fine with it.  The fertilization line is what matters for pro-lifers, so it very much matters how Plan B works in regard to that line."
questionshere123,2022-07-01 19:16:06,iehleqg,t3_h8w9fu,t1_iehk9d8,"So I suppose doctors who discard embryos that have chromosomal abnormalities and wouldn’t survive should be arrested for murder? What do you propose we do with all of the embryos that are currently frozen? Should we force women to carry those? According to you they are lives, not allowing them to grow into humans would be murder, no?"
OhNoTokyo,2022-07-01 19:21:55,iehm8tf,t3_h8w9fu,t1_iehleqg,"&gt;So I suppose doctors who discard embryos that have chromosomal abnormalities and wouldn’t survive should be arrested for murder?  I am not going to argue which charge they would get, but yes, they should be arrested if they create and discard embryos, yes.  &gt;What do you propose we do with all of the embryos that are currently frozen?  Try to find surrogates for them.  There do exist programs for this already which could be expanded.  In some cases, they would die and that is unavoidable.  &gt;Should we force women to carry those?  No.  &gt; According to you they are lives, not allowing them to grow into humans would be murder, no?  No, it would not be murder.  The right to life is not the right to be kept alive at all costs, it is the right to not be killed.  While a woman carrying a child already cannot abort that child, no one is under obligation to take on a child they don't already have."
questionshere123,2022-07-01 19:52:22,iehqmtt,t3_h8w9fu,t1_iehm8tf,"Right but if a woman has 12 embryos on ice that belong to her, should she also be forced to give birth to them? I don’t see how it’s any different than not allowing an embryo in her body from implanting, so why not make women carry all embryos so as not to “kill” anyone?"
OhNoTokyo,2022-07-01 19:54:16,iehqwst,t3_h8w9fu,t1_iehqmtt,"&gt;Right but if a woman has 12 embryos on ice that belong to her, should she also be forced to give birth to them?  No.  There can be no force to save someone else.  However, the doctor and her should be charged with their death if they were created after a ban is in place for creating them.   The right to life is the right to not be killed, not the right to be saved.  The mother has no obligation to save those children.  Period.  She did have an obligation to not endanger them by placing them in such a situation, so that is likely what she and the doctor would be charged with."
questionshere123,2022-07-01 20:17:35,iehu9xp,t3_h8w9fu,t1_iehqwst,"So why does she have the obligation to allow one to attach to her body without her consent? In both instances she created them, one by a medical doctor and the other by sex. You argue that you’re against plan B because it can cause abortion by preventing an embryo to implant, so how is it any different from creating an embryo and preventing it from implanting by keeping it in a lab?"
OhNoTokyo,2022-07-01 20:30:23,iehw407,t3_h8w9fu,t1_iehu9xp,"Last I checked, she didn't attach anything to herself, and no one made her do it.  You can't blame someone for an automatic process.  &gt;You argue that you’re against plan B because it can cause abortion by preventing an embryo to implant, so how is it any different from creating an embryo and preventing it from implanting by keeping it in a lab?  It's very different, but I don't understand what you think you are trying to say.  I already pointed out that while I believe that making the child should be illegal, having to implant it cannot be forced (although you could negate the child endangerment charge by actually implanting it, but that would be your choice).  Taking Plan B itself would be problematic because it would kill someone who is already inside the woman.    The differences in the two situations are quite clear.  I am not sure why you think they are at all similar."
