Here's the thing, they don't give a shit about guns or gun deaths. They don't care how many people commit suicide every year. If they did, they would be doing something about it. They had a monopoly on both legislative chambers and the executive branch. They did nothing about this. That means this is politics.   Politically they think guns will drive people to the polls to vote for them so they speak out on the issue. They try to make hay while they think the issue is growing. If people stopped carring about it they would stop pushing for legislation. The legislation they create won't hurt them because they will be able to get exceptions and have security people. Thus if they think it's good political capital they will bank on it.   They really don't care."

Access controls, terrain grading, even the direction of fire are specified.

There are hundreds of non-safety related design aspects highlighted in the range design criteria; missing any one of these would mean that an outdoor range wasn't compliant and could be shut down. For example:  A range that doesn't meet a  1% - 2% cross slope for drainage doesn't meet RDC. &gt;The surface should be smooth, firm, and graded to drain away from the targets. A slight side-to-side grade of 1 percent to 2 percent should be provided for storm water runoff. For baffled ranges, the lateral slope should not exceed 2 percent because of the geometry of the baffle system  Similarly, if a range target is off by &gt;.01%  (~3/8 of an inch, on a 100 yard target,) the range fails RDC.  &gt; Range distances from the firing line to the target are determined by the approved DOE qualification courses of fire for all weapons available for use by Protective Force (PF) personnel and by site-specific training courses of fire. The distances from the firing line to the target should be accurate to +.01 percent. It is important that any inaccuracy in the firing line-to-target distance is a greater, rather than lesser, distance (e.g., 101 yards for a 100-yard range instead of 99 yards).  Or, if you have your target next to a berm, it also fails RDC.  &gt;) The target line should be a minimum of 30 feet from the toe of the impact berm. The distance between targets must be the same as the distance between firing positions.  Edit: [Source for RDC](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2013/05/f1/Range_Design_Criteria.pdf)"

Having children shouldn't be terrifying and shouldn't be life crippling.. if we made it so people were encouraged to have children and taking care of those children, feeding those children, educating those children didn't destroy relationships and families.. it would take a huge bite out of the problem.  All ""banning things"" ever does is ""shake the hornets nest"" and convince everyone to go vote.. which is why we have a bunch of anti-gun democrats winning elections.  Another big controversial fix is that we need to teach kids about protection and contraception in schools and kids need to have access to them.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. ‚Äî That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, ‚Äî That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security."" - Declaration of Independence, 1776](https://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/index.html)"

Yes even the ones that use those freedoms to express their hatred of us (Catholics who did not always have an easy ride in America, with my family having the complication of a history of well documented Seneca connections, unlike a certain presidential candidate...).   It is that tolerance and devotion to defending all peoples' rights, even the ones we disagree with, that sets us part from the rest of the world. The real definition of true American Exceptionalism.  I bring up my social and family history to specifically point out myself and almost all white supremacists / nationalists/ whatever the fuck would be at extreme, irreconcilable odds with each other. My family is the product of race mixing and I believe we are all the better for it (side note, I am known within my hunting group and past coworkers for being unnaturally and inexplicably talented at tracking and spotting people or animals).  However, unlike the intolerant, cancel culture left, I still believe in defending *everyone's* rights. Including, yes, people I don't like and who in all likelihood do not like me.  South Park years ago had an episode about the meaning and value of tolerance versus acceptance (ie endorsement). I think if this particular poster was being sincere (and I kind of doubt it) they could greatly benefit from.  Edit: Thank you for the gold kind stranger (although I got an idea who its was).

For at least the last eleven years, leftists/anti-rights activists have been calling everything they dislike ""white supremacist,"" then demanded that anything thus labeled be exterminated. You are, right now, posting in a ""white supremacist"" forum (so called by the contributors at forums like AgainstHateSubreddits, GunsAreCool, SocialistRA etc, because it hosts people they call ""white supremacists."") To assume it won't happen to you is foolish, because by posting here you are already a ""white supremacist"" by association.  The anti-rights faction's claim to care about ""white supremacy"" is clearly false when they won't disavow their own. So what is this about, if not ""white supremacy?"" Use some common sense:  1) Anti-rights labels something ""white supremacist.""  2) Anti-rights demands pro-rights remove it.  3) Pro-rights complies, in an attempt to appease an enemy that wants them to vanish. (That doesn't sound very smart, does it? The only way to appease such an enemy would, in fact, be by vanishing.)  4) Compliance thus reduces pro-rights numbers, accomplishing what anti-rights set out to do from the beginning.  When the enemy's first rule of engagement is ""win at all costs,"" we cannot be obligated to accept any rules of engagement they propose. When the enemy refuses to play by the rules it wants to set for us, we shouldn't play by those rules either. If you can't connect the dots and see a bigger picture than yourself, that's your own problem."

Mastering this skill in a safe and responsible manner seems to speak louder than words to those who oppose gun ownership.

Estimates of defensive gun usages (DGU) per year may help, low estimates are in the hundreds of thousands, higher estimates go over 1 million.  Point out that law enforcement takes time to get to your location even when they're moving literally as fast as they can. Average police response time in the US is something like ten minutes. The more urgent a situation you're in, the less time you can afford to spend wondering where the cops are.  Simple stats on ownership compared to violent incidents could help. It's estimated that roughly 100 million Americans own one or more firearms and yet fewer than 50,000 fatal incidents occur each year (and when you subtract suicides, the final number of fatal shootings per year is less than 20,000).  Since it's your family, you can make it personal too, and bring up the hard topics. How would they feel if your home was broken into and you were defenseless? Cornered in a dark alley or parking lot by a large man (or men, plural)? Point out that if somebody has ill intentions and is hopped up on any drugs, anything less than lethal force does not ensure your safety."

[PewPewTactical did a write up that would get you started.](https://www.pewpewtactical.com/concealed-carry-insurance-comparison-chart/) Carry insurance (which also works at home) is interesting in that not many people think about it, and would help educate your family that people take this stuff seriously for defense and not to be ""disgusting.""  But I'm more curious if you'd be able to delve into the source of their disgust. You allowing them to be open and honest with you is the other half of you being open and honest with them. Find out if they're prejudiced against gun owners. If they are just afraid of what they don't know. If they have some deep political belief that only the government should wield such power. Or if they actually have some weird or perverse sense that you're incapable of being responsible. Open and honest communication can open the flood gates. Tread lightly.

Add in some empty hand classes, baton and blade also.  There are many ways to defend yourself that don‚Äôt include a gun.  I‚Äôm not trying to persuade you to not get a gun but rather build yourself an arsenal of techniques.    A big part of all this training will be a good instructor teaching situational awareness and avoidance.

Some of the stats are similar between them so I'll post them as separate comments to make them easier to read. This might not be what your looking for, but its good information to help back up your arguments.  Also Welcome to the club!  Happy to have you! Please remember to practice and learn as much as you can!  ----‚Äê------------------  So I got a copy pasta , then two goods links afterwards.   The ACTUAL facts about gun violence in America  To start, America ranks 10th out of DEVELOPED nations for highest chance of dying in a mass shooting, and 111th overall. Even then, your chance of dying in one of these events is less than you being struck and killed by lightning... twice  https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/mass-shootings-by-country/  To continue, lets find out how mass shootings are defined in the US versus every other Country. The official number used to require 6 deaths or more - this was lowered to 4 INJURIES or more to push the narrative that they're far more common. This definition would be totally fine if it weren't for the fact that anti-gun websites misrepresent this number by including gang shootouts, drug deals gone bad, etc. They've even been caught going as far as Including airsoft and BB guns  https://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/shootingtracker-com-uses-pellet-guns-to-boost-mass-shooting-numbers/  This is all without even getting into the fact that ANY discharge of a firearm on school grounds automatically counts as a school shooting, which also constitutes a mass shooting. Let's say someone has an accidental discharge and they live in a school zone - mass shooting. Let's say someone commits suicide at midnight on a Saturday - mass shooting.  The US is the only place with funky rules like this, and even with them, we're not even close to the top spot  AR-15's are the main firearm discussed by the left, so I'll be addressing that next. ALL TYPES of rifles together killed 297 people last year, and that's ANY instance in which it was used - whether that be lawful, such as home defense - or criminal such as gang activity, mass shootings, etc.  Fists and feet killed 700.  Knives killed 1,500.  Guns aren't the problem, especially rifles  https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-8.xls  There are about 30,000 gun related deaths per year by firearms, this number is not disputed. (1)  U.S. population 328 million as of January 2018. (2)  Do the math: 0.00915% of the population dies from gun related actions each year.  Statistically speaking, this is insignificant. It's not even a rounding error.  What is not insignificant, however, is a breakdown of those 30,000 deaths:  ‚Ä¢ 22,938 (76%) are by suicide which can't be prevented by gun laws (3)  ‚Ä¢ 987 (3%) are by law enforcement, thus not relevant to Gun Control discussion. (4)  ‚Ä¢ 489 (2%) are accidental (5)  So no, ""gun violence"" isn't 30,000 annually, but rather 5,577... 0.0017% of the population.  Still too many? Let's look at location:  298 (5%) - St Louis, MO (6)  327 (6%) - Detroit, MI (6)  328 (6%) - Baltimore, MD (6)  764 (14%) - Chicago, IL (6)  That's over 30% of all gun crime. In just 4 cities.  This leaves 3,856 for for everywhere else in America... about 77 deaths per state. Obviously some States have higher rates than others  Yes, 5,577 is absolutely horrific, but let's think for a minute...  But what about other deaths each year?  70,000+ die from a drug overdose (7)  49,000 people die per year from the flu (8)  37,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities (9)  Now it gets interesting:  250,000+ people die each year from preventable medical errors. (10) You are safer in Chicago than when you are in a hospital!  610,000 people die per year from heart disease (11) Even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save about twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.).  A 10% reduction in medical errors would be 66% of the total gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides.  Simple, easily preventable, 10% reductions!  We don't have a gun problem... We have a political agenda and media sensationalism problem.  Here are some statistics about defensive gun use in the U.S. as well.  https://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/3#15  Page 15:  Almost all national survey estimates indicate that defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals, with estimates of annual uses ranging from about 500,000 to more than 3 million (Kleck, 2001a), in the context of about 300,000 violent crimes involving firearms in 2008 (BJS, 2010).  That's a minimum 500,000 incidents/assaults deterred, if you were to play devil's advocate and say that only 10% of that low end number is accurate, then that is still more than the number of deaths, even including suicides. (Which account for over 75% of all deaths by gun  Older study, 1995:  https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6853&amp;context=jclc  Page 164  The most technically sound estimates presented in Table 2 are those based on the shorter one-year recall period that rely on Rs' first-hand accounts of their own experiences (person-based estimates). These estimates appear in the first two columns.

HursHH,2020-06-15 22:16:17,fuy6kpb,t3_h9nnkg,t1_fuy6e0k,"Part 2:   GUN FACTS:  There are 30,000 gun related deaths per year by firearms, and this number is not disputed.   The U.S. population is 324,059,091 as of June 22, 2016.   *Do the math: 0.00925% of the population dies from gun related actions each year.   Statistically speaking, this is insignificant!¬†   What is never told, however, is a breakdown of those 30,000 deaths, to put them in perspective as compared to other causes of death:  ‚Ä¢ 65% of those deaths are by suicide, which would never be prevented by gun laws. ‚Ä¢ 15% are by law enforcement in the line of duty and justified. ‚Ä¢ 17% are through criminal activity, gang and drug related or mentally ill persons ‚Äì better known as gun violence. ‚Ä¢ 3% are accidental discharge deaths.  So technically, ""gun violence"" is not 30,000 annually, but drops to 5,100.  Still too many?   Now lets look at how those deaths spanned across the nation. ‚Ä¢ 480 homicides (9.4%) were in Chicago ‚Ä¢ 344 homicides (6.7%) were in Baltimore ‚Ä¢ 333 homicides (6.5%) were in Detroit ‚Ä¢ 119 homicides (2.3%) were in Washington D.C. (a 54% increase over prior years)  So basically, 25% of all gun crime happens in just 4 cities.   All 4 of those cities have strict gun laws, so it is not the lack of law that is the root cause.  This basically leaves 3,825 for the entire rest of the nation, or about 75 deaths per state. That is an average because some States have much higher rates than others. For example, California had 1,169 and Alabama had 1.  Now, who has the strictest gun laws by far?  California, of course, but understand, it is not guns causing this. It is a crime rate spawned by the number of criminal persons residing in those cities and states.   So if all cities and states are not created equal, then there must be something other than the tool causing the gun deaths.  Are 5,100 deaths per year horrific? How about in comparison to other deaths? All death is sad and especially so when it is in the commission of a crime but that is the nature of crime. Robbery, death, rape, assault are all done by criminals. It is ludicrous to think that criminals will obey laws. That is why they are called criminals.  But what about other deaths each year? ‚Ä¢ 40,000+ die from a drug overdose‚ÄìTHERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THAT! ‚Ä¢ 36,000 people die per year from the flu, far exceeding the criminal gun deaths. ‚Ä¢ 34,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities(exceeding gun deaths even if you include suicide). Now it gets good: ‚Ä¢ 200,000+ people die each year (and growing) from preventable medical errors. You are safer walking in the worst areas of Chicago than you are when you are in a hospital! ‚Ä¢ 710,000 people die per year from heart disease. It‚Äôs time to stop the double cheeseburgers! So what is the point? If the liberal loons and the anti-gun movement focused their attention on heart disease, even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.).   A 10% reduction in medical errors would be 66% of the total number of gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides ................ Simple, easily preventable 10% reductions!   So you have to ask yourself, in the grand scheme of things, why the focus on guns?   It's pretty simple: Taking away guns gives control to governments.   The founders of this nation knew that regardless of the form of government, those in power may become corrupt and seek to rule as the British did by trying to disarm the populace of the colonies.   It is not difficult to understand that a disarmed populace is a controlled populace.  Thus, the second amendment #2A was proudly and boldly included in the U.S. Constitution. It must be preserved at all costs.   So the next time someone tries to tell you that gun control is about saving lives, look at these facts and remember these words from Noah Webster:   ""Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed.""¬†   Author unknown"

What are *they personally* doing to keep you safe?  If they claim ""just call the police!"" bring up the police departments that have publicly announced they will not be showing up for anything they seem ""minor"". Before you let them rebut, look up the average police response time in your county/city. Nationally is like 10 mins.  From that, if you really don't care about burning bridges, ask them specifically if they can get to you in [average police response time]-1 minutes. Then lower the number to your average draw time.  If they don't understand that they're trying to make you *objectively* less safe, the only things you could really say are the kind of things that end relationships."

Try to get them to walk a mile in your shoes and for them to see a firearm as an object. Sadly this will take time as they've more then likely been anti gun for a while. Hope that helps.

I've learned from personal experience that even family isn't reliable if they happen to not like you (or in my case, disagree with your job choice).  Riots are quite possibly the worst thing to get caught up in, and this last week proves it. Fire and EMS were blocked from putting out a fire of a burning home with small children inside. A cop that served honorably for decades was shot and killed over a tv. Business owners have taken to vandalizing their own businesses to try and trick looters into thinking there isn't anything left to loot. In my hometown, my dad has found fliers every couple of blocks urging rioters to kill cops and/or white people on sight and he's been flying under the radar because my sister-in-law has been grabbing things for him while she's in town.

Some of the best advice I can give you, have someone at the store show you how to safely handle the pistol, how to load and unload, and how to verify it is indeed unloaded. You will need to handle the gun when you get home, you need to get very comfortable knowing how to check if it is loaded or not (most accidental shootings happen from ‚Äúunloaded‚Äù guns). You really need to get comfortable possessing a gun before you try to depend on it. Once you go to your lessons and are shown ways to carry it, practice drawing it as much as it takes to get comfortable.    Here are you weapon safety rules:  Treat every weapon as if it was loaded  Never point your weapon at anything you do not intend to shoot  Keep your weapon on safe until you are ready to fire  Keep your finger off the trigger until you intend to fire  Know your target and what lies beyond it."

I think it all boils down to them not knowing how dangerous the world actually is, they probably were in the wrong end of a knife or a gun and have problems understanding their experience is not universal, that someone should account to every possible thing that can make you safer from most common(a fire extinguisher, a steel door frame, avoiding bad zones) until you start getting to the last resort that is a gun, because protecting your own life and family is a right that unfortunately people like me have lost almost all presence of it.

It becomes more difficult when they interpret constitutional issues, since that would require more than just the legislature to change and is a much more onerous process.   The 14th amendment is the biggest problem and needs to be rewritten because the courts have interpreted it terribly. It was initially created to prevent states from discriminating and oppressing black Americans, but it‚Äôs mostly been used to take restrictions on the federal government in the constitution and apply them to the states, which that amendment was never intended to do."

Because there‚Äôs no other way to interpret the 2A other than there shouldn‚Äôt be any restrictions whatsoever *at the federal level*.   But if you interpret the 2A correctly now (along with the incorrect interpretation of the 14th), that means nobody ‚Äî federal, state, or local ‚Äî can pass any restrictions whatsoever because of 14th amendment incorporation, which isn‚Äôt what the framers (or the writers of the 14th amendment) intended. Indeed, many states and territories already had restrictions and protections prior to statehood.   So now we‚Äôre stuck in a world where judges are just deciding whether they like a particular gun law or not and applying that same standard everywhere because there‚Äôs no way to deal with the 2A without overturning McDonald and Heller and every ruling that relied on incorporation.

Georgia, (1832),which is most famous for its dicta, which laid out the relationship between tribes and the state and federal governments. Chief Justice John Marshall laid out in this opinion that the relationship between the Indian Nations and the United States is that of nations. This did not include the rights of possession to their land or political dominion over their laws. He acknowledged that the exercise of conquest and purchase can give political dominion, but those are in the hands of the federal government, and individual states had no authority in American Indian affairs. Georgia's statute was therefore invalid.  The ruling ordered that Worcester be freed, and Georgia complied after several months. But Jackson basically said fuck Native American rights with this quote.  In a popular quotation that is believed to be apocryphal, President Andrew Jackson reportedly responded: ""John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it!"" Because Jackson proceeded with Cherokee removal, Worcester did not aid indigenous rights at the time. Forced migration of Indians via the Trail of Tears was one result."

Rational basis means that essentially every gun control measure would be affirmed. Rational basis isn‚Äôt the standard used for any other enumerated, fundamental rights. SCOTUS already ruled that rational basis would be wrong for the second amendment.   Intermediate scrutiny has never been used for enumerated, fundamentals rights. It‚Äôs actually only been used a couple of times. There‚Äôs no precedent for treating enumerated fundamental rights differently from one another, and distinguishing gun rights from other enumerated rights would open the door for the court to limit different rights in different ways. That‚Äôs a bad outcome.   Strict scrutiny means that essentially every gun control law would be struck down. It‚Äôs the correct standard because it‚Äôs the standard SCOTUS uses for every other enumerated fundamental right. SCOTUS doesn‚Äôt think it seems right that the government should lack the power to restrict gun ownership and possession.   So, SCOTUS is in a position where it has to say that gun laws are subject to strict scrutiny review. It doesn‚Äôt like the results, but it doesn‚Äôt want to fuck up its other precedent.

Jsvshdidvdjd,2020-06-16 21:20:00,fv21h5a,t3_ha4hyf,t1_fv0odqu,"&gt; If I remember correctly, ‚Äútextualism‚Äù means interpreting the word of law as it‚Äôs written. Period. ‚ÄúOriginalism‚Äù means interpreting the law in the historical context in which it was passed.  This is not entirely correct, you are describing original intent theory but there are two forms of originalism, original intent theory and the more common original meaning theory. original meaning theory means interpreting based on the letter of the law as it would have been interpreted when it was written, this is what Scalia endorsed. Textualism is interpreting the letter of the law based on what the words mean now.   &gt;For example, Gorsuch stated in the Title VII that firing somebody for being trans means that you are firing somebody based on sex/gender, which violates Title VII. This is textualism. Originalism would be the argument that ‚ÄúOh, well, when Congress passed this law, they (probably) weren‚Äôt thinking of trans people.‚Äù  this is not correct, the ruling didn't reinterpret sex, on the contrary it used biological sex. According to the ruling if you allow a biological woman to wear a dress/use female pronouns or marry a man then prohibiting a biological man from doing the same things is by definition discrimination based on biological sex. Interpreting based on the intent of the authors (original intent theory) is a minority opinion even among originalists"

With the exception of a few places where it explicitly forbids states from doing something and grants that power to the federal government (e.g. signing treaties with foreign governments), nothing else in the Constitution is meant to restrict states, only the federal government.   Most notably, the restrictions in the Bill of Rights, which weren't intended, nor were they originally interpretted, to apply to the states. If you read the Federalist papers and early federal court decisions, everyone agreed with that.   But we've added a bunch of amendments to the Constitution since then. One of those is the 14th amendment.  It was designed to end Jim crow laws and prevent states from discriminating against black Americans and treating them unequally. It's a federal constitutional amendment that restricts what states can do.   At some point, federal judges began ""incorporating"" other bill of rights amendments into the 14th, and saying that other bill of rights amendments now apply to the states -- https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_of_the_Bill_of_Rights  But that legal reasoning isn't very sound.

Or it may have subdued some of the fucking testosterone so they could think straight. Doubt it though, their actions speak otherwise. Guys like these make it real hard to convince other people that 2A means everyone.  And if one line makes you throw out a valid statement I suggest you rethink your debate tactics. Attack the foundation, not some side remark. That doesn't invalidate shit.   PS: I also previously retracted remarks regarding self defense plausibility after seeing new up close video.

piffburg,2020-06-18 02:51:17,fv6znnq,t3_ha9mb9,t1_fv63ctl,"The people attacking and chasing him weren't the people he allegedly assaulted. He didn't ""start a fight"" with the people attacking him.   He may have assaulted someone or multiple people,  but that is a separate issue. He was fleeing, deescalating and 3 people armed with deadly weapons - one had a knife, one had a skateboard which they'd already hit him in the head with multiple times.   These were people looking for ""mob jusice"" and screamed ""I'm going to fucking kill you"" while charging at him with a knife.   I think he's in the wrong for throwing that woman to the ground, and possibly pepper spraying people (unclear videos of that). But at the point of him retreating, the people charging at him became the agressors and he had a right to defend his life. These people attacking him were looking for ""mob justice"". Hes also an idiot for carrying without a permit, thats really not going to help him in a courtroom.   IMO justified self-defense shooting."

He was foolish for carrying a gun without a permit AND picking a fight. They say you should never break more than one law at a time. Of course, I don't believe he should need a government permission slip to carry a gun, but I also think he should have stayed out of that crowd."

But the woman he threw to the ground wasn't unprovoked, she was instigating him and backing into him purposefully and impeding his movement. Whether he responded proportionally is another question.   But yeah if you punched my wife, then me and 2 of my friends came at you with knives screaming that we're going to kill you, lunged at you trying to stab you,  and got within distance to do so I'd say shooting me would be justified. If i chased you down and punched you,  but you shot me - not justified. Proportional response."

No, not likely at all.  The mistake Thomas is making here is in conflating a specific controversial example of a rights-related activity with the entirety of another right:  ""free speech rights"" and ""abortion rights"" are similar in terms with ""gun rights"" because they're the blanket terms.  And if some city in the US tried to completely outlaw all gun possession and the lower court had sided with the city's law then it's virtually guaranteed that the Court would hear review."

I'd love to see what you would do (assuming you carry) if someone walked up to your wife/girlfriend and flung her to the ground and then maced you for being angry at him about it.

Not directly related, but you might find [Thomas's dissenting opinion](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/18-824_2cp3.pdf) on one of the ten dropped cases interesting. He goes into English common law protecting the right to *bear* arms, and also discusses the stupid ""sliding scale"" mentality.

Apply the case as written, not necessarily how it's been done in the past. As an example, Plessy v. Ferguson set up the precedent that ""separate but equal"" was OK; Brown v.

These shooters that make it to mass media that everyone obsesses about are also often from above average backgrounds. Upwards mobility is also pretty good when you look at the data.   What I've seen over the last thirty years is a cultural shift among middle America. There's lots of despair out there these days that's self inflicted. People don't like their job, but at the same time aren't taking active steps to improve it, they just accept it's out of their control. They're drowning in housing costs but won't move out of trendy areas of town or decrease their square footage. They have no friends but won't join a sports team, or social club, or church. Keeping up with the Joneses used to mean keeping up with an actual friend or neighbor. Now it means keeping up with the best of the curated lives of your hundreds of Facebook friends. The news you consumed used to be a paper or news station trying to appeal to the greatest number of people in a geographic location that have a variety of views. Now online news dominates and is designed to serve you a customized echo chamber based on what you click on, and you click on crap that causes you concern.   I'm 100% certain that many problems can be solved by building a culture that promotes socializing in real life. Having a diverse friends group serves as a check and balance for many people's sanity and allows you to relate better to others. It's important to see someone work hard to save for a family trip so it's clear there's a trader of. If we continue this trend of allowing technology to isolate us from the people around us you'll see despair continue to increase and more people going to unhealthy ideologies and lashing out violently."

I used to worry about the ""wasted vote"" issue.  Now I just simply refuse to vote for a candidate that I think is worse than my first pick but better than my last pick. However, you are absolutely right state and local politics matter.  I understand the arguement, but I believe until we all start voting for the best candidates, regardless of thier odds of winning nothing will ever change.  I think voting Jorgenson is especially important this election, one because she is the most pure 2A advocate out there by a long shot. I'm talking repeal the NFA, disband the ATF pure!  Love it!  But most importantly she sends the clearest message to the parties.  Even the people who subscribe to the wasted vote theory can make a vote for Jo and not worry, because as of right now I simply don't see a viable way for Trump to win.  If a third party starts garnering major percentages of the vote for president, that's what people will notice.  Not state rep seats.  That's what will start change. Send a message that we've had enough!  Vote Jo!    As far as localities go, unfortunately there aren't a lot of libertarian options at local levels.  I typically go with the republicans on local elections because they tend to side with the 2A better than dems.  That being said, I'd vote libertarian even if were a tight race between a republican and a democrat if I thought the Libertarian was my best choice.  I have given up on voting for my second choice because my first can't win.  That logic just keeps us mired with a bunch of perpetual second choices in office.    This election is starting to feel like it's a foregone conclusion for Biden.  It's the best time to send a message that we want better choices without having to worry about feeling like you're wasting your vote.  Biden is almost certainly going to win.  I will be voting for Jorgenson to send a message, (and because I agree with her positions on almost everything).  The house is going to hold democrat.  The senate is where the real battle will be. As far local politics go, I'll never be mad at anyone voting for what they think is best for 2A.  At the end of they day if things go poorly at the ballot box, we still have two more boxes left."

What people are talking about (falsely) when they say a ban on gun research is this from 1996. its the Dickey Amendment)  The important part i have below:  In United States politics, the Dickey Amendment is a provision first inserted as a rider into the 1996 federal government omnibus spending bill which mandated that ‚Äúnone of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) may be used to advocate or promote gun control.‚Äù  What that has turned into over time is that the media (i know, i know) has turned it into a ban. then you get news stories that say ‚ÄúThere is a ban on the research of gun violence.‚Äù The CDC has always been able to research the effects, what they are not allowed to do is say ‚Äúguns are bad dont own them.‚Äù  In 2013 President Obama signed his executive orders saying Go Look at violence CDC . The outcome was [THIS](www.gunsandammo.com/politics/cdc-gun-research-backfires-on-obama). It was largely swept under the rug since it didnt have the desired results.        More Info: Dispelling the Myth That the US Government is banned from Conducting Gun Violence Research  Origins of the Myth  At it‚Äôs core this is a gross misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the fact. While the US government and it‚Äôs agencies are free to conduct whatever research, studies, or reports on the subject they see fit the CDC is explicitly barred from using it‚Äôs funds to promote gun control.  The actual law reads as such:  ‚ÄúNone of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control.‚Äù ‚Äì Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1997  So the CDC can research whatever they want, produce any studies or reports they want, and present any findings they want. The only thing they cannot do is used their funding to promote gun control, which is a political position.  The Reasoning behind the Restriction  Those that repeat and propagate this myth often blame the NRA for it. However as the above citation shows the actual law was put in place by the US Congress.  It was Congress that did this because of the CDC‚Äôs strong political stance against guns that was present in their work. This is due in  part to, ‚Äù [the] official goal of the CDC‚Äôs parent agency, the U.S. Public Health Service, had been ‚Äú‚Ä¶to reduce the number of handguns in private ownership‚Äù, starting with a 25% reduction by the turn of the century.‚Äù  But why would the US Congress feel so compelled to implement such a specific measure? As the aforementioned quote mentioned the CDC, by it‚Äôs own admission, took a stance against gun ownership and produced biased studies and reports to support the predetermined objective of promoting gun control.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to systematically build a case that owning firearms causes deaths.  We‚Äôre doing the most we can do, given the political realities. ‚Äì P.W. O‚ÄôCarroll, Acting Section Head of Division of Injury Control, CDC, quoted in Marsha F. Goldsmith, ‚ÄúEpidemiologists Aim at New Target: Health Risk of Handgun Proliferation,‚Äù Journal of the American Medical Association vol. 261 no. 5, February 3, 1989, pp. 675-76.  ‚ÄúIn 1979 the American public health community adopted the ‚Äúobjective to reduce the number of handguns in private ownership,‚Äù the initial target being a 25% reduction by the year 2000.3 Based on studies, and propelled by leadership from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the objective has broadened so that it now includes banning and confiscation of all handguns, restrictive licensing of owners of other firearms, and eventual elimination of firearms from American life, excepting (perhaps) only a small elite of extremely wealthy collectors, hunters, or target shooters. This is the case in many European countries.‚Äù  The Clear Evidence that Disproves the Myth  Still the most damning evidence that disproves  this myth are the reports and studies themselves. Here are some recent studies on gun violence produced by the CDC:  CDC Report, ‚ÄúFirearm Homicides and Suicides in Major Metropolitan Areas ‚Äî United States, 2006‚Äì2007 and 2009‚Äì2010‚Äù. CDC Report, ‚ÄúElevated Rates of Urban Firearm Violence and Opportunities for Prevention‚ÄîWilmington, Delaware Final Report‚Äù. CDC, Report, ‚ÄúPriorities for Research to Reduce the Threat of Firearm-Related Violence‚Äù. Besides these the CDC has also conducted firrarms related studies from those on suicides to those on hearing safety, such as:  CDC Report, ‚ÄúNoise and Lead Exposures at an Outdoor Firing Range ‚îÄ California‚Äù Increase in Suicide in the United States, 1999‚Äì2014 In addition to the CDC reports there are a plethora of government agencies and organizations that conduct firearm related and specific studies and reports ranging from annual reports to special studies. These include:  FBI Annual Uniform Crime Reporting FBI report ‚ÄúA Study of Active Shooter Incidents in the United States Between 2000 and 2013‚Äù The Congressional Research Service‚Äôs report ‚ÄúMass Murder with Firearms: Incidents and Victims, 1999-2013‚Äù DOJ Report to National Institute of Justice, ‚ÄúUpdated Assessment of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban: Impacts on Gun Markets and Gun Violence, 1994-2003‚Äù DOJ‚Äôs ‚ÄúFirearm Use by Offenders‚Äù. The Bureau of Justice Statistics alone has Over 20 gun related studies and reports over the past two decades.  Conclusion  So not only can the US government conduct studies, research, and reports on the subject, they have produced a vast amount if those over the past few decades."

This sounded completely wrong to me, and when I analyzed the article, I found out it was full of all kinds of errors. https://www.medpagetoday.com/publichealthpolicy/publichealth/55267  ‚ÄúWhat people don‚Äôt understand is there‚Äôs no federal ban on research,‚Äù said Mark Rosenberg, MD, MPP, a 20-year CDC veteran who says he was fired as director of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control in 1999 because of his commitment to studying gun violence prevention. ‚ÄúBut the leaders of CDC are scared to take this on because it‚Äôs so politically controversial.‚Äù https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2513131  2016 New CDC Report Shows America‚Äôs Gun Suicide Problem Getting Worse https://www.thetrace.org/2016/04/cdc-study-gun-suicides-getting-worse/  Defensive Gun Use (Part I) ‚Äì The CDC Report on Gun Violence https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2013/9/17/1238623/-Defensive-Gun-Use-The-CDC-Report-on-Gun-Violence  Why the CDC still isn‚Äôt researching gun violence, despite the ban being lifted two years ago https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2015/01/14/why-the-cdc-still-isnt-researching-gun-violence-despite-the-ban-being-lifted-two-years-ago/  Why we can‚Äôt trust the CDC with gun research http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2015/12/why-we-cant-trust-the-cdc-with-gun-research-000340  CDC Gun Research Backfires on Obama http://www.gunsandammo.com/politics/cdc-gun-research-backfires-on-obama/  The Purpose of Gun Research Is to Enact Gun Control?  http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/437674/gun-control-research-cdc-ban-explained     Additional Information from other sources: Info you can use to debunk the ‚ÄúCDC is banned from gun violence research‚Äù  I keep finding the false statement that the CDC is banned from gun research.  What people are talking about (falsely) when they say a ban on gun research is this from 1996. its the Dickey Amendment)  The important part i have below:  In United States politics, the Dickey Amendment is a provision first inserted as a rider into the 1996 federal government omnibus spending bill which mandated that ‚Äúnone of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) may be used to advocate or promote gun control.‚Äù  What that has turned into over time is that the media (i know, i know) has turned it into a ban. then you get news stories that say ‚ÄúThere is a ban on the research of gun violence.‚Äù The CDC has always been able to research the effects, what they are not allowed to do is say ‚Äúguns are bad dont own them.‚Äù  In 2013 President Obama signed his executive orders saying Go Look at violence CDC . The outcome was [THIS](www.gunsandammo.com/politics/cdc-gun-research-backfires-on-obama). It was largely swept under the rug since it didnt have the desired results.        More Info: Dispelling the Myth That the US Government is banned from Conducting Gun Violence Research  Origins of the Myth  At it‚Äôs core this is a gross misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the fact. While the US government and it‚Äôs agencies are free to conduct whatever research, studies, or reports on the subject they see fit the CDC is explicitly barred from using it‚Äôs funds to promote gun control.  The actual law reads as such:  ‚ÄúNone of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control.‚Äù ‚Äì Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1997  So the CDC can research whatever they want, produce any studies or reports they want, and present any findings they want. The only thing they cannot do is used their funding to promote gun control, which is a political position.  The Reasoning behind the Restriction  Those that repeat and propagate this myth often blame the NRA for it. However as the above citation shows the actual law was put in place by the US Congress.  It was Congress that did this because of the CDC‚Äôs strong political stance against guns that was present in their work. This is due in  part to, ‚Äù [the] official goal of the CDC‚Äôs parent agency, the U.S. Public Health Service, had been ‚Äú‚Ä¶to reduce the number of handguns in private ownership‚Äù, starting with a 25% reduction by the turn of the century.‚Äù  But why would the US Congress feel so compelled to implement such a specific measure? As the aforementioned quote mentioned the CDC, by it‚Äôs own admission, took a stance against gun ownership and produced biased studies and reports to support the predetermined objective of promoting gun control.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to systematically build a case that owning firearms causes deaths.  We‚Äôre doing the most we can do, given the political realities. ‚Äì P.W. O‚ÄôCarroll, Acting Section Head of Division of Injury Control, CDC, quoted in Marsha F. Goldsmith, ‚ÄúEpidemiologists Aim at New Target: Health Risk of Handgun Proliferation,‚Äù Journal of the American Medical Association vol. 261 no. 5, February 3, 1989, pp. 675-76.  ‚ÄúIn 1979 the American public health community adopted the ‚Äúobjective to reduce the number of handguns in private ownership,‚Äù the initial target being a 25% reduction by the year 2000.3 Based on studies, and propelled by leadership from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the objective has broadened so that it now includes banning and confiscation of all handguns, restrictive licensing of owners of other firearms, and eventual elimination of firearms from American life, excepting (perhaps) only a small elite of extremely wealthy collectors, hunters, or target shooters. This is the case in many European countries.‚Äù  The Clear Evidence that Disproves the Myth  Still the most damning evidence that disproves  this myth are the reports and studies themselves. Here are some recent studies on gun violence produced by the CDC:  CDC Report, ‚ÄúFirearm Homicides and Suicides in Major Metropolitan Areas ‚Äî United States, 2006‚Äì2007 and 2009‚Äì2010‚Äù. CDC Report, ‚ÄúElevated Rates of Urban Firearm Violence and Opportunities for Prevention‚ÄîWilmington, Delaware Final Report‚Äù. CDC, Report, ‚ÄúPriorities for Research to Reduce the Threat of Firearm-Related Violence‚Äù. Besides these the CDC has also conducted firrarms related studies from those on suicides to those on hearing safety, such as:  CDC Report, ‚ÄúNoise and Lead Exposures at an Outdoor Firing Range ‚îÄ California‚Äù Increase in Suicide in the United States, 1999‚Äì2014 In addition to the CDC reports there are a plethora of government agencies and organizations that conduct firearm related and specific studies and reports ranging from annual reports to special studies. These include:  FBI Annual Uniform Crime Reporting FBI report ‚ÄúA Study of Active Shooter Incidents in the United States Between 2000 and 2013‚Äù The Congressional Research Service‚Äôs report ‚ÄúMass Murder with Firearms: Incidents and Victims, 1999-2013‚Äù DOJ Report to National Institute of Justice, ‚ÄúUpdated Assessment of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban: Impacts on Gun Markets and Gun Violence, 1994-2003‚Äù DOJ‚Äôs ‚ÄúFirearm Use by Offenders‚Äù. The Bureau of Justice Statistics alone has Over 20 gun related studies and reports over the past two decades.  Conclusion  So not only can the US government conduct studies, research, and reports on the subject, they have produced a vast amount if those over the past few decades."

I don't think any of us enjoy seeing innocent people get shot, especially by crazy people who never should have had access to guns but want to go on a murder spree. Or by criminals in inner cities who are victimizing other inner city dwellers.  I know I'm preaching to the choir here, but none of these proposals is going to help a damn thing, aside from some that we've already implemented into law.   Assault weapons ban? The original '94 ban only banned certain cosmetic features, utterly ineffectual. More modern iterations have been far too wide sweeping in what they want to ban, targeting much more than just ""military-style semi-automatic weapons."" Nevermind that hunting weapons, some of which fire much more powerful rounds than a 5.56, can be used to equally devastating effect with just slightly more effort. And nevermind that there are already tons of AR's and related rifles floating out there, and how easy it is to get illegally imported weapons, what are we going to do? Shut down the illegal arms trade and round up every AR or similar rifle in the country? Nevermind the immorality of illegality of that, it's just not possible.   In what way are background checks not universal already? They come from a *federal* criminal record database. If there are records missing from there, that's the fault of the people running the damn system.   Banning bump stocks does zero good, the Vegas shooter could have done just as much damage without one, if not more, if he'd taken the care to aim his shots more carefully. It's also possible to bump fire your gun without a bump fire stock.  Banning ""high"" (read: standard) capacity magazines? Put aside the huge supply of them that is already floating around. Banning them means little to the mass shooter who can afford to take a couple extra seconds to reload with another 10 rounder, while it could mean everything to the law abiding concealed carrier who's trying to stop the psycho, or the man who's trying to defend his home from one or multiple attackers.   Red flag laws *sound* like a good idea, in theory, but the way most of them are written make a mockery of due process and multiple amendments, and leave very little recourse for anybody who has their guns wrongfully taken away from them. Kinda like the no-fly list. We have something in Florida called the Baker Act that is written much better and largely has the same effect: it's a mental health intervention law.  We already prohibit convicted domestic abusers from legally purchasing firearms, because domestic abuse is a felony. Just like how every other felon is banned from legally purchasing a firearm.   Gun dealers are law abiding 99.9% of the time already, because most of them are scared to death of the ATF. True, some mass murderers and criminals got their weapons legally from a dealer, but how are you going to blame a dealer for selling a weapon to somebody whose background check came back clean, unless you can prove that the person was clearly not in their right mind in the presence of the dealer?  Suing gun manufacturers or trade groups is beyond ridiculous. They don't sell guns directly and they have zero direct control over who the dealers who sell to, as long as the dealers are following federal law.   Safety standards for gun locks and gun safes? That might be the *one* semi-reasonable thing in here, if we can make locks and cases more impenetrable to criminals who try to steal guns.   If we want to reduce firearm deaths in this country, you have to tackle the issues of illegal firearm supply, crime and poverty, and mental health issues. But that's far more complicated than and not nearly as politically useful/expedient as being able to point at a tangible object and say ""there's the source of all this evil."" And we have to get rid of gun-free zones, since over 90% of mass shootings happen in those. The one exception should be bars, because guns and alcohol do not mix. Our schools should all have armed security, or at least allow teachers who want to go through extra psych evals and training to have their legal firearms safely secured at schools in case of emergency."

Or they will say a bump stock allows the full auto rate of fire, again to an uneducated public.

Everyone can see your intellectual dishonesty on display here because everyone knows there aren't anywhere near 40 thousand murders a year in this category. There are anywhere from 12-16 thousand murders per year which is nothing in a nation of 328 million. And 30%-48% of those 328 million are gun owners depending on the survey (Yet no one I know would ever admit to a pollster that they own guns and they always lie about it -- so I'm certain it's closer to at least 60% in reality).   Defensive uses counted by dozens of studies over the last decade range from 300,000 per year as the most conservative estimate from leftist groups up to 3 million per year. It's probably somewhere in the middle. Regardless, there are absolutely a TON of lives saved. FAR more than lives taken. That's not even getting into the fact that around 80% of all homicides by gun are gang and/or drug related, in the inner city, and are almost always perpetrated by criminals who aren't allowed to own them anyway.  The numbers aren't in your favor. Not even 1% of guns owned in this country have ever been nor ever will be used in a crime. Face it - you're not getting anywhere with this nonsense."

The final finding was that more research was needed.

As it is the 2010s had the lowest rates of violent crime on record since before 1960. The homicide rate in the 2010s was literally half what it was in the 1980s. Meanwhile gun control has actually became significantly more relaxed over time. For instance in 1986, only one state Vermont allowed for permitless carry of a firearm, and 16 states banned public carry entirely. In 2018, 16 states allow for permitless carry, and not a single one bans carry entirely. Yet in 1986 the homicide rate was 8.6 per 100k, while in 2018 it was 5.0, almost 60% lower."

The CDC was never subject to a complete restriction that made it drop anything with the word ""gun"" in it, but it's well known that this amounted to a major gag order in practice that prevented most of the actually valuable research from being done because anything that even remotely resembled an assessment of gun laws could be flagged as ""promoting gun control"".

It even literally says that the benefits of defensive gun use could well be outweighed by the harms caused by guns (it  states that the potentially increased risks of homicide, suicide and violent gun crime ""could cancel or outweigh the beneficial effects of defensive gun use"").  You're also conveniently letting out some of its other findings, such as a mention that there's no strong evidence that right to carry laws deter, prevent or decrease crime, that virtually all illegal guns are obtained as a result of the legal market, that background checks can help keep guns out of the hands of criminals, that stronger restrictions prohibiting those subject to a restraining order from owning a gun saves lives, that ""prevention strategies"" such as red flag laws are promising, that waiting periods could help address gun suicides since many of those happen very shortly after the gun is bought, and several others.

As I already said, this wasn't some original research project that produced new evidence. It simply indexed what some previous studies had to say on a small number of aspects related to gun violence in order to identify new research questions that future studies should try to answer. That's it. It's a wish list of things we should be funding research into - not some innovative study analyzing gun control and definitively finding out what works or not. The title alone should tell you that this is nothing more than an academic road map of ""priorities"" for future work, hence why it didn't receive as much attention as you might have thought.  Obama didn't have the CDC investigate gun violence. He put out a memorandum that requested the Centers to fund another group to identify what *should* be researched if they got the requested funding for it (which [Republicans shot down](https://www.propublica.org/article/republicans-say-no-to-cdc-gun-violence-research) and denied the next year, so the CDC never actually got to research the things it mentioned in the report). You keep pretending this study was big news but you completely misunderstand what it actually did, as [the APA](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2013/07-08/gun-violence) here clearly explains.  CDC: ""these are important issues with a lot of conflicting information that make it unclear whether these gun laws work, we should receive funding to research defensive gun use further"".  You: ""THE CDC PROVED THESE GUN LAWS DON'T WORK AND THAT DEFENSIVE GUN USE IS EQUIVALENT TO GUN CRIME, OBAMA AND THE MSM TRIED TO COVER IT UP!!!"".  [This](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/01/16/the-study-that-gun-rights-activists-keep-citing-but-completely-misunderstand/) might be a good read for you too, as it actually explains what the whole purpose of the study was to people who keep citing it wrongly.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;I could go point by point with you  You couldn't and you know it.

For starters, I suggest everyone reading this opens the study, presses ctrl+F to open the search box, searches the text for ""assault weapon"", and sees that there's a *grand total of 0 results*. Isn't it interesting how a 120 page study you claim found that the 1994 AWB doesn't work fails to even include a single mention of the law it supposedly analyzes? Could it be that I'm right and that it didn't actually do what you falsely claimed it did?"

No, they simply weren't receiving any funding and were explicitly barred from actually researching the potentially positive impact of gun policy. I didn't refer you to a biased opinion. I quoted an actual CDC report (that you even linked yourself without understanding what it actually says) that literally states that the law (which you said wasn't a ban) ""effectively halted all firearm-related injury research at the CDC"".   Whether the law amounted to a complete ban or not, the fact remains that the CDC didn't receive proper funding for gun policy research and was not allowed to seriously investigate the topic. This is a fact. The 2013 report you linked as ""proof"" that the CDC could research gun violence is actually a wish list in which the Centers go over a number of topics they desperately want to be able to research but don't have the funding or competences for, as [the APA](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2013/07-08/gun-violence) here clearly explains.  The result? Republicans [denied the call](https://www.propublica.org/article/republicans-say-no-to-cdc-gun-violence-research) and prevented the CDC from actually following up on the road map for gun violence research. In other words, you literally used a request by the CDC to be allowed to study gun violence and answer pressing questions that was then denied so they were never allowed to study these issues as an example of the CDC ""studying gun violence"". Come on now. You're free to think the CDC shouldn't be allowed to study this, but let's not pretend they were actually in a position to conduct thorough research on the topic."

""Soon the funding was restored, but designated elsewhere, and wording was inserted into the CDC‚Äôs appropriations bill that, ‚ÄúNone of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control.

While the US government and it‚Äôs agencies are free to conduct whatever research, studies, or reports on the subject they see fit the CDC is explicitly barred from using it‚Äôs funds to promote gun control.  The actual law reads as such:  ‚ÄúNone of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control.‚Äù ‚Äì Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1997  So the CDC can research whatever they want, produce any studies or reports they want, and present any findings they want.

spam4name,2020-07-03 11:06:37,fwsm3dm,t3_hjmbil,t1_fwsdkpo,"&amp;#x200B;  &gt;It's like you chose not to read anything I posted or you're being willfully ignorant.  Perhaps you should read your own source in full rather than selectively cite certain parts.  This is a literal quote from your first article: ""(the CDC) responded with a statement noting it had commissioned an agenda of possible research goals but *still lacked the dedicated funding to pursue it* (this agenda is the 2013 study that you linked but misunderstood). It then continues to say that ""*Congress has continued to block dedicated funding.* Obama requested $10 million for the CDC‚Äôs gun violence research in his last two budgets. *Both times the Republican-controlled House of Representatives said no.*"" Your second article expands on this by explaining that the CDC works by ""line-item budgeting"", which means they can only conduct comprehensive research on things they've been allotted dedicated resources for and are very limited in choosing what they can work on. They're not just handed a lump sum they can freely distribute how they see fit. If there's no dedicated funding for gun violence research, the best they can do is hope to tangentially cram it under a different topic (like suicide).  In other words, Obama signed an EO instructing the CDC to research gun violence. The CDC responded by commissioning an agenda on research priorities and signaling they needed funding to follow up on this. Both times this came up in the budget, Republicans denied the funding they needed to research the issue. Your article even explains that the only way they can touch upon gun violence by incidentally tying it to things like ""domestic violence"" but lack the means to analyze it in full. And as I already explained, the ""promote gun control"" prohibition is so broad and vague that it creates serious chilling effects out of valid concerns of retaliation (as your second source confirms). Think of my comparison with traffic laws. ""Our findings indicate that mandatory seat belts cut traffic deaths in half"" = NOPE, can't have research like that because it's advocating traffic control, your grant is now revoked and your research has been suspended! Now apply the same to any policy relating to guns. As an academic myself, it's painfully clear how much this stifles research.  I wasn't expecting much but you responding by going ""no, they actually did receive funding for this!"" only to link an article that contradicts you and *literally* says Republicans denied the requested funding *twice* after they published a detailed road map? Now that's a pleasant surprise, so thanks for helping me make my case.  Ultimately, the facts are clear. The lack of dedicated funding and the broad prohibition on ""gun control advocacy"" tremendously limited research and kneecapped most of the CDC's efforts. The 2013 CDC report you linked directly states this (again: this is the CDC itself literally saying the law effectively made their research impossible). The WaPo article you linked confirms it. The JAMA piece you linked validates it. You cannot in good faith deny that the CDC has practically been prevented from conducting valuable research into gun violence, even if the law itself doesn't literally say that it's banned from doing so."

Only issues I have is that the first link goes on about Dems wanting to destroy suburbs so they can get the taxes and votes. But, and correct me if I'm wrong, taxes are done by county, which can usually includes the suburbs or parts thereof for cities.   Rural areas tend to have their own county sometimes with suburbs mixed in. Again, the idea of a suburb is just an area outlying part of a city or town (per Webster). So in a lot of those places the taxes already go to the primary population area which can indeed be a town or a city. Saying someone is out to get the suburbs is a little bit of stretch. Goes back to the whole war on improper nouns can never be accomplished. It's just too vague.   With that don't get me wrong, I'm more of a constitutionalist and believe taxation without representation is theft. So repurposing any area for taxation is horse shit. But the wording on those strikes me more as rabble rousing."

When the Dems install more dem voters in the suburbs the local elections will go to the Dems.  They will vote to increase taxes to fund more ""social programs"" to bring more Dem voters to the suburbs etc.  And taxes exist at all levels with various differences by state.  There are local taxes, there are county taxes, there are state taxes, and there are federal taxes.  In some areas there are ""special assessments"" that span political boundaries if not directly then by setting up ""regional authorities"" that require each sub-jurisdiction to contribute - and they get that money from taxes.  Where I live is considered a suburb of Washington DC. My tax money goes to the county I live in.  When I lived in an another area I was taxed by a city and the county.  I pay Fed taxes of course but I'm also stuck paying taxes to fund the Washington Metropolitan Transportation Authority which funds the Metro, DCA, IAD, and BWI.  But what this is really about is pushing more Dem voters into areas that are traditionally GOP voter areas to dilute, or eliminate those GOP areas and transfer power to the DEMs after which they'll transfer ""wealth"" to wherever they want.  This is not rabble rousing, this is fact. And it's already happening."
Johnnys_an_American,2020-07-03 15:15:24,fwt84h2,t3_hkciqq,t1_fwt4clk,"Jorgensen is one of the few that has at least stated she doesn't want more laws in guns. I would like to see some laws  gone, such as red flag laws as they are just used as an unconstitutional use to seize property and perform no knock raids. I do like her for her stance on ending asset forfeiture.   But at the end of the day it is also viability and will they actually follow through. Also look at Trump. Per his statements he is pro 2A and all about gun rights, which is a lie. He says whatever he thinks will get him votes and does whatever he wants. His actions show him to not be pro 2A. Frankly he is not pro most of our constitution. Dems tend to have an anti 2A stance but historically Obama wasn't any worse than Trump as far as laws go. Most laws end up on a local level anyways.   In the end I just expect a politician to lie untill proven wrong by their voting history or laws they enact. Obama was ""the most Anti gun president ever"" if you believe people on here. And yet he only passed 2 gun laws, one of which expanded gun rights. Otherwise he had 23 executive actions that were anti 2A but none of those had teeth and were even seeker than an executive order. So it was all politics. Now a lot of that was because he had a ton of opposition in the Senate and House. Trump has had both the Senate and House majority and then lost the House and what has he done for us? He did repeal the social security law which was one of the two Obama era laws. That was good but not huge. And he banned bump stocks. Don't even get me started on pistol braces. But at least he did clarify that the ATF can't just make up rules, so good on him for that."

But we probably need to stop thinking in terms of urban, suburban, rural and more in terms of population density.  My first home was in what I would have called a suburb.  My friends that lived closer to the city thought I lived in the sticks and wouldn't travel out to my new home.  Now they live even further out due to the cost of housing and that first home I had is considered ""close"" to the city and it resembles a more urban area more and more every year.

Trump did not use the US military on US soil.  He only activated the DC National Guard for DC.  That is not the same as using active duty troops on US soil.  And in other states, even Minnesota, it was the Governors that called out the national guard.  The rioting is the responsibility of the local governors/mayors etc that refused to stop it.  See: Jenny Durkan, Seattle, What‚Äôs-his-name in Minneapolis, Stoney in Richmond VA, DeBlasio in NY - all who told he local police to lay back.  &gt; Are they also responsible for the bump stock ban?  In part.  Feinstein had already submitted legislation to ban bump stocks.  They likely would have added more bans/regulations.  And in the post Las Vegas climate something was going to pass.  Trump doing it administratively makes it easier to reverse later.  &gt; As I have said several times on this site I am a constitutionalist, and both sides are trampling the hell out of it.

I will freely admit that the democratic party is basically right-lite in a lot of how it works (particularly compared to many other nations). That said, it's the party that actively concerns itself with climate change and many figures within it are doing something about it. Things like the green new deal could be called more propaganda, but at least its *something* that has actual plans made to deal with the problems.  Furthermore, by and large the democrats seem to be the party who actually believe in scientists and if really pressed would actually respond to them if enough pressure is applied. In that vein, even if climate policy is ""just for show"" or whatever as you seem to claim, the people who vote Democrat ARE worried about climate action, and that has tangible effects on people who want to be elected/be reelected.  In short, I'll take my chances with the people who at least seem willing to deal with the existential threat than the ones who are actively trying to ignore/exacerbate the problem."

When there's no leader or certain people are locked, the gangs split into little cliques and that just increases the problem.

And then you use the N word as if it's ok.  &gt; Gang violence is a cycle of retaliation that can't be ended like that.  Did you even research Project Exile? Or is that beyond your limited abilities?  [Here, let me make it easy for you.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Exile)  &gt; During the first year of Project Exile (1998), homicides in Richmond declined 33%, for the lowest number since 1987, and armed robberies declined 30%. In 1999, homicides declined another 21%. By 2007, homicides in Richmond were down to 57 compared to 122 in the year before Project Exile.  That's called success.  &gt; Also, every time more people are locked up, the more violence increases because there is no leader.  And eventually they're all in jail, dead, or have learned that that lifestyle will lead to one of those two outcomes.  But it needs to be swift, certain, and permanent.  [Or you get this.](https://nypost.com/2020/07/08/marshals-swat-team-in-standoff-with-gunman-in-new-jersey/)  &gt; Sayegh said it was possible the killings were retaliation by one or more **recently released gang members,** according to WNBC.  And I note that your primary solution is to legalize crime.  Well sure, that will result in less criminals but it won't change who is victimized.  And if they can't make money slinging pot they'll do it with meth and heroin (as they're doing today).    &gt; helping these kids lose the hate in their heart for their fellow nigga.  First, stop with the racist term. Second, make it for all humans.  Third, just how do you plan to do this?  Wishful thinking?"

One example being after certain BD sets in Chicago shot one of their opposition they stole his drug supply (his pack) and smoked it / him. It's really some dishonorable shit and some BDs have gotten killed in retaliation for speaking like that.

You're conflating two unrelated issues.  &gt; All Gun control laws are infringements  Not all, but most.  Those that take gun rights from those convicted of felonies or adjudicated mentally ill are valid.  &gt; and all drugs laws are wasting money with prohibition.  No they're not.  But at least you didn't say they are infringements as there is no constitutionally protected right to take drugs.  And I view it as money well spent compared to:  &gt; The average cost to treat overdose patients admitted to hospital intensive care units climbed from $58,517 in 2009 to $92,408 in 2015  Who's paying for that?  &gt; America is supposed to be all about freedom.  And with that freedom comes responsibility and duties.   &gt; Why should the government be able to tell me not to smoke cannabis or take LSD? Or even crack?  Simple. Because I don't want to have to pay for the treatment you require from overdosing on it.  I don't want to have to pay for your housing and food because you can't hold a job due to drug use. And I sure as hell don't want to have to deal with the aftermath of shooting you when you break into my home to steal something to pay for your drug habit.  &gt; But remember, nobody would be smoking crack if it was easier to access powdered cocaine.  Powder is readily available. It's just more expensive. So people without the means choose crack instead.  ----combining responses to your multiple posts ------  &gt; Nobody is being victimized by drug use either.   Sure they are.  People like myself that are stuck paying for higher health care costs and other treatment programs for people who use drugs and can't pay for themselves.  People that are victimized by criminals committing crimes to pay for their drugs - which they'd do even if drugs were legal as they still need to pay for  them.  People who are the victims of car crashes from someone driving under the influence of drugs etc.  &gt; Nobody is a victim from something they choose to put in their body.  Well shit then. Let's hold them accountable.  Starting with no treatment if they can't pre-pay for it.  &gt; But thats where alot of violence comes from. Arguments over who robbed who over drugs.  And the solution to that problem is to lock the criminals up and leave them there.  &gt; One example being after certain BD sets in Chicago shot one of their opposition they stole his drug supply (his pack) and smoked it / him. It's really some dishonorable shit and some BDs have gotten killed in retaliation for speaking like that.  There is no honor among thieves. Maybe you've heard that before - maybe not.  Same solution.

She embodied everything I hated about career, corrupt, elitist politicians. That's how I decided FOR ONE TIME ONLY to vote Republican. Then I stood right there in the political center watching my party moving to left more and more every day! I saw what I considered the party of reason getting infected with TDS and becoming cringey. When EVERY SINGLE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE pretty much promised me that they would at the very least go for another AWB if not outright confiscate my means of self defense, I lost all hope. Sorry, I need to send them a LOUD MESSAGE with my vote that our rights are not up for a debate and if they keep using gun control as their rallying cry they cannot have my vote."

I assure you that Libertarians are not secret democrats who hate guns.      Do people really not get the electoral college? Electoral votes count in the general election. FEC funds are determined by percentage of the POPULAR vote. So if you're in a state that will go solidly for your the candidate you oppose, it's safe to vote Libertarian. If you're in a swing state, vote your preference.      For example, anyone who votes Republican in California or New York is literally wasting their vote. It'll have zero effect on the general election. If, instead, all those (R) voters voted (L), those 2 states ALONE would provide enough votes for the Libertarian party to receive over 100 million in federal funding in 2024.   Trump got elected because he convinced people he was an outsider, and would ""drain the swamp."" Having a 3rd party on the debate stage that believes in smaller government, fewer taxes, and more freedom would force the 2 major parties to confront issues that they've been ignoring for decades, and make it tougher for them to ignore demographics that they've taking for granted.   The concept of strategic voting shouldn't be that tough to understand."

In fact I don‚Äôt know a single Republican who would throw away their entire ideology because of the coronavirus.  People often conflate the idea of people being upset at their candidate with people being upset enough to flip parties. I live in a pretty liberal state and most people here are back to shaking hands. I‚Äôm seeing more and more people gathering and going back to normal. My reality doesn‚Äôt translate in to a country upset with Trump, it looks more like most people agree with him than disagree (and please don‚Äôt link some stupid biased liberal poll because I don‚Äôt believe any)."
cunt_punch_420,2020-07-14 18:16:47,fy27393,t3_hqr5gp,t1_fy1zw7p,With the handling of corona virus im basing in on people i know in person and close online friends. Reddit as a whole as well as the media are a terrible gauge for how people feeling about him since theyve been doing anything they can to make him look bad since 2016. However a lot of peope i know voted for him last time tbat arent now. And do you just call any poll you disagree with a liberal poll? Like i get theres a lot of biased and shitty poll. But not eceryone is a liberal poll

Raztan,2020-07-15 00:12:01,fy3dfzc,t3_hqr5gp,t1_fy1bimn,Well not sure how you separate the two but not a fan either way.  All lives matter.. try saying that to a BLM crowd.. see what happens.
Raztan,2020-07-15 00:13:06,fy3dk2r,t3_hqr5gp,t1_fy1meqe,If you just believe in her.. we can do it /s
Raztan,2020-07-15 00:14:16,fy3doh2,t3_hqr5gp,t1_fy1jfd2,He's not.. if he wins it's going to be cause he's not Trump..  Biden is doing the smart thing staying off camera.
Raztan,2020-07-15 00:17:03,fy3dyv1,t3_hqr5gp,t1_fxzjbuh,I heard he's gonna go door to door him self with his SxS and case of Ensure. lol

GloryholeKaleidscope,2020-07-15 05:17:32,fy46mos,t3_hqr5gp,t1_fxzn4kv,"This would never happen, guns out number people in the US.  I think it would play out like the bump stock ban, almost zero were turned in, they all fell off a boat. Im not saying if a situation like you described happened it would start a civil war, bc it prob wouldn't, but wide spread non-compliance  by ""offenders"" in combo w/ local law enforcement refusing to enforce federal laws would render the govt useless. If by some crazy reason they started prosecuting/jailing non-violent gun owners, then my 1st, ""prob wouldn't happen"" point, becomes a reality. Good luck Joe."
abbin_looc,2020-07-15 05:24:18,fy474tb,t3_hnm5lc,t1_fxftstk,"All that does is effectively give Biden another vote. If you don‚Äôt want Biden to win, your only option is trump. Some nobody who can‚Äôt even get a majority in one county isn‚Äôt going to make a difference against Biden."
abbin_looc,2020-07-15 05:25:55,fy47980,t3_hnm5lc,t1_fxcgfdj,It is definitely about winning. Losing means that Biden and his insane views about the 2A get the executive branch and it‚Äôs all downhill from there
Sand_Trout,2020-07-15 06:23:03,fy4bc01,t3_hnm5lc,t1_fy474tb,"No, a vote for a third party is closest to to staying home and not voting."

Raztan,2020-07-15 20:26:26,fy6jql9,t3_hqr5gp,t1_fy6ivxj,"Oh I get it.. is this like defund the police.. but we don't mean defund the police, but we just want you to cut their budget?  Which part is tearing down monuments?  Which part gets upset, violent and shoots people in the face if you say ""all lives matter""?  It's all very confusing"
Raztan,2020-07-15 21:57:17,fy6uwbk,t3_hqr5gp,t1_fy6qiyl,"Ya know, maybe it's cause I live in the north but I don't recall ever seeing neo-nazi stuff at any gun rallies I've been to.  Im not saying it hasn't happen.. But either not common or it's region specific."
