TTauriStellarBody,2019-12-29 17:12:02,fcgfu91,t3_eh72c7,t3_eh72c7,"This is the Clausius-Clapeyron relation   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clausius%E2%80%93Clapeyron\_relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clausius%E2%80%93Clapeyron_relation)   It basically means that the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere increases as temperature increases.   Using this and the basic fact that doubling CO2 will produce about 1.2C, you can calculate an increase of temperature by about 3-4C per doubling of CO2.   To find that we will not experience this temperature increase would require a model that shows a significant negative feedback that was not working between the last glaciation and today, that is when small changes  in the orbit, allowed for warmer northern hemisphere summers, this melted the ice sheets and produced some of the warming from the deep glacial state 18000 years ago till today. Only when  CO2 and water vapour feedback are included with albedo change can we get our estimates to come close too the temperature change.   So on the whole models are used to refine this very rough working understanding of the basics of climate science.   In other words, our expectations of warming is built on very basic science and our observations support it. Models are to tell us how much warming and where, rather than it will warm."

fake-meows,2019-12-29 18:50:36,fcgyu0n,t3_eh72c7,t3_eh72c7,"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All\_models\_are\_wrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong)  Models are not even supposed to be unflawed!  By definition, these are abstractions that are used to simplify and predict things.  Part of the process of ""simplifying"" or ""abstracting"" is deliberately ignoring certain things that don't matter, so the model will end up not being a perfect representation, which is a type of philosophical flaw.  For instance, you would not eat a menu, so it has that flaw of not being a perfect representation of food.  Being worried about ""flaws"" is a kind of selective criticism which isn't really important or useful, it's a misunderstanding of what things are supposed to be.  It's more important to ask whether the models are *right* or *wrong*.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate\_model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_model)  In modeling the climate, a large number of factors are being considered.  These are basically ""computer simulations"".  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verification\_and\_validation\_of\_computer\_simulation\_models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verification_and_validation_of_computer_simulation_models)  When computers are used to simulate real-world effects, there are many ways to validate and find errors.  This is a check for rightness or wrongness.  Most of the ways involve comparing computer simulations against real-world data.  For example, a climate model could be built using historical temperature data.  Some data could be held back from the simulation, and the simulation could be tested to see whether it outputs the same data as we actually really observed in the held back set.  If it does that very well, people will tend to be more confident in the ability of that model to predict things.  So it's important to note that our data that we are using for validation is basically taken out of a historical record.  But, if we are considering predicting the future (outside our experience, outside our data), then consider that there can be hidden ""tipping points"":  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipping\_points\_in\_the\_climate\_system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipping_points_in_the_climate_system)  "" Tipping point behaviour in the climate can also be described in mathematical terms. Tipping points are then seen as any type of bifurcation with hysteresis. Hysteresis is the dependence of the state of a system on its history. For instance, depending on how warm and cold it was in the past, there can be differing amounts of ice present on the poles at the same concentration of greenhouse gases or temperature.""  ""Bifurcation with hysteresis."" Translation: the system suddenly switches to a new state where it starts to seek a new balance point.  Based on what events unfold, the system can choose from multiple outcomes, but there's no way to switch between them after they are observed.  For example, a given concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere could guarantee more than one climate state -- one hot, one cold.  Which state the climate gets into depends, for example, on the amount of ice in the pole that was there leading to the time of the CO2 increase.  (That's a made up example.)  So observe that there might not be a 1:1 relationship with CO2 and temperature if that's the case.  There's a connection but it's more complicated and needs to look at many factors.  (Totally fake made up example.)  This is part of why climate simulations need to consider a lot of moving parts.  This is essentially like the observation from chaos theory that deterministic non-linear systems can be very sensitive to small changes in their initial states (butterfly effect: butterfly flapping its wings in china eventually causes a hurricane in texas).  [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos\_theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory)  Climate systems ARE chaotic systems.  We know that.  That means that ultimately we cannot model them perfectly and especially not far in advance.  This is a sort of theoretical overview about various ways that systems can suddenly *become* unstable.  There are all kinds of patterns.  [https://galileo-unbound.blog/2019/04/24/biased-double-well-potential-bistability-bifurcation-and-hysteresis/](https://galileo-unbound.blog/2019/04/24/biased-double-well-potential-bistability-bifurcation-and-hysteresis/)  One of the issues for validation of climate model simulations is that we haven't crossed the sorts of irreversible tipping points that would generate all the necessary high quality real-world data to check our simulations against!  In other words, we might be validating a chaotic unstable system, but validating it as if it's stable, using data that  is taken from one of many *stable node states* of a much more complex situation that is likely to change dynamically.  Looking at some special historical events in earth's history, there are many observations that suggest this might indeed be the case.  The global system historically has found many stable climate regimes that don't tend to reverse themselves until some large nudge happens and then they suddenly destabilize.  The transitions between these states, by comparison, are very rapid switches with pretty chaotic observations.  Translation: models may not be good at accurately predicting tipping points *in advance*.  We have no real way to know what the important factors are before we see them.  This is really not good news for humans who are trying to predict the future.  Models that we have are suggesting that the effects will be more severe than we are able to predict accurately, quantitatively.   Here is an scientific paper that explores the stability of the climate system:  [https://www.pnas.org/content/115/33/8252](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/33/8252)  The bottom line is that our civilization is attempting to have a goal of aiming towards some moderate / intermediate amount of temperature rise.  We actually don't have evidence that this is definitely possible.  Our simulations about what happens may indeed be wrong about that.  In other words, *some* small amount of atmospheric CO2 could lead us to a world in which CO2 actually *can't stay small*!  The small amount *we* add might be a ""butterfly effect"" situation that causes a very major change, where suddenly many other sources start adding CO2 without human input.  So far, this is being considered by a lot of people...but the models we use *don't actually know how to model this perfectly.*  So basically, our models work well up until we do the right changes to the system to reach some previously unknown, hidden thresholds/boundaries.  The models we do have are telling us that it's very likely that the climate system won't actually stay stable.  As for more exact knowledge of the future, that remains uncertain, but it could be a lot worse than we're able to know in advance."

TobesRR,2019-12-29 21:39:28,fchycz9,t3_eh72c7,t1_fcfvuw2,An important part of scientific modelling and especially earth system modelling is to be aware of the inaccuracies. No model is perfect but just because there are inaccuracies in some aspects of the model does not make the entire model inaccurate. models are refined to be as accurate as possible and earth system models currently used in reports such as the IPCC reports are the best we have at the moment. If someone is skeptical of the model ask them to point out a more accurate one that fails to predict climate change. If the best models we have all point to the same outcome then its probably right

However, certain native flora in   Australia have evolved to rely on bushfires as a means of reproduction, and fire events are an interwoven and an essential part of the ecology of the continent.  For thousands of years, Indigenous Australians have used fire to foster grasslands for hunting and to clear tracks through dense vegetation.  Major firestorms that result in severe loss of life are often named based on the day on which they occur, such as Ash Wednesday and Black Saturday.  ***  ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/climatechange/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28"

RCPs don't take into account feedback by design, and not by mistake.  The RCPs don't take into account feedbacks in the carbon cycle *because the carbon cycle is handled by the climate models.* This is done so that we can 'diagnose' from the output of the Earth System Models (ESMs) or General Circulation Models (GCMs) the compatible emissions for that target.  From [9.4.5](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/WG1AR5_Chapter09_FINAL.pdf) of WG1 AR5,  &gt;For CMIP5 a different experimental design was proposed in which the core  simulations  use  prescribed  RCPs  of  atmospheric  CO2  and  other  GHGs (Moss et al., 2010). Under a prescribed CO2 scenario, ESMs calcu-late land and ocean carbon fluxes interactively, but these fluxes do not affect the evolution of atmospheric CO2. Instead the modelled land and ocean  fluxes,  along  with  the  prescribed  increase  in  atmospheric  CO2, can be used to diagnose the ‘compatible’ emissions of CO2 consistent with  the  simulation.     I suggest you read [Box 6.4](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/WG1AR5_Chapter06_FINAL.pdf), Section 9.4.5, [12.1, and 12.2](https://ar5-syr.ipcc.ch/resources/htmlpdf/WG1AR5_Chapter12_FINAL/) to understand how feedbacks are already integrated into the CMIP5 projections, just not through the input RCPs.   As an example of how concentration-driven models extract compatible emissions associated with given RCPs I suggest you read [this article.](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2010GL046270)  Edit: Why do I bring all this up? Because your conclusion of ""We're fucked"" seems to suggest that you think that because RCPs don't include feedbacks that their associated projections must be underestimations. But this is not so, RCPs feed into climate models that take into account feedbacks, so when we diagnose what emissions are compatible with that RCP we are taking into account feedbacks, and the projected rise in temperatures does so too.  A legitimate point of contention, however, is the fact that there remains great uncertainty in the magnitudes of feedbacks between models. But this uncertainty is also transparently treated by AR5. Read the sections for more info."

Scottlikessports,2020-01-02 17:17:16,fcuoobt,t3_eiq85n,t1_fcsx72f,"The biggest concern I have is how the polar regions have ll that carbon that is going to be releasing megatons of both CO2 as well as methane as the permafrost melts and the bacteria multiply.Anchorage hit 90°F for the frst time in recorded history (1965) and we are talking about a lot of solar energy in the polar regions as a lot of direct sun hitting the ground during their growing season each summer. We could see a huge amount of CO2 Release and more importantly Methane.   How this relates to actually burning of coal is unknown but given what we do know about how coal was produced I fear the carbon rich soil could still be our demise even if we do get man made emissions under control. This is my concern that I have for my Children and Grand Children. We saw the first scientific paper on this subject occur back in 1989 that warned us that this was going to be a major issue in out future. Yet we still have the Republican party unmistakably be ignorant enough to risk everything to keep the status quo.   How isn't a green energy conversion not going to spur a bigger economy than the one we have right now is my question? We are going to need so many new carbon neutral technologies, solar cells, wind energy turbines, nuclear power on a small scale that is safe for the environment and unlikely to be used for nefarious reasons.  We will also need enough electric vehicles to  replace all of the combustible engines we now use!   I think if I were in oil , gas, or coal I would be looking into investing into the alternative sources and ride the new train into the future. It seems pretty simple to me. The conversion is going to take time but the conversion is going to have to happen sometime in the future anyway. Get in on the bottom floor now ans invest heavily in the technologies as they become available. The more oil and gas we can keep sequestered in the ground, the better off the world will survive our future.  As it is I am sad for what is happening to our wildlife. All I can say is that I was lucky enough to live within the Mississippi River National Wildlife Refuge for the past 20 years and I have seen the eagles soar again and the Trumpeter Swans be reintroduced as well. To see hundreds of them across from me in a backwater area has been a sight to see and I only hate that it is only a short time this year because the river is flowing for the first time ever on January 2nd.   They no longer have to congregate where the springs remain warm enough to keep some water areas open even in the dead of winter. Nope, They are not obliged to stay here any longer and I fear this is going to be a common finding just like what is happening in Alaska. We are going to see warmer and warmer winters even in the contiguous United States including the upper Midwest. We are averaging 10°F warmer this month and I had been seeing 4°F warmer winters compared to 50 years ago here where I live. When is this going to get better? I fear not for hundreds of years.  This is not just a climate issue, but also air pollution, plastic pollution, and overpopulation, with deforestation and a wasteful throw away society. I did my part over the past 10 years and rarely even get into a vehicle. I minimize my electricity use and heating as much as possible and I am definitely down to only a few tons in my carbon footprint. I also do all of my gardening by hand  and that includes a large garden that My Wife and I survive on usually. Unfortunately, even that option was taken away from me last spring as my land was under water for too long to use given how polluted the river is with human and animal waste. Nope. We screwed up and I am ashamed to have been a part of it.  If only for a short time frame I was able to see what this must have looked like back before the advent DDT and other pesticides and pollutants and the channelization that the corp did to make it a river for transportation.This reminds me so much like what happened back in the mid to late 1900's when the Republican party denied the hazards of smoking. It is no different. Their entire  party exist based on keeping their constituents afraid and keeping them in believing that they know what's best for them.  What a shame that these people allow their politicians to choose how they live their lives and in what to believe is the best future in their lives. We still have the coal miners believing that Trump will someday get them their jobs back. How sad is this situation? We can't fix them remaining uneducated and ignorant into how to break away from their dependence on the system! Sorry to say that but it is the truth."

This is similar to how chaotic factors cause hurricanes, droughts, floods, etc. The difference is that with climate change, all these potential disasters have a subtly higher chance of happening, and are slightly more severe than they would've been without climate change. This all adds up to more and more severe disasters in vulnerable places on earth.  I don't understand how this is so hard to grasp."

As usual facts are the first thing to go out the window.   As pointed out below, the Greens party in Australia has never held political office, at the federal or state level. Not once. There's a photo going around on social media -  shared by (and I'm being generous here) those with an uncritical mind - that shows a former Australian Prime Minister of the left-leaning Labor party shaking hands with the then-leader of the federal Greens party. The viewer is then asked to take a leap of unreason and accept that a leader who lost government in 2013 has somehow influenced federal as well as state policies ever since.  In NSW - one of the hardest hit states - the current Liberal National Party (a right leaning amalgamation of big C conservatives with a preference for helping out the rich - the Liberal party - and essentially country party members with a focus on supporting the agricultural as well as the mining sector) slashed funding for maintaining the regional fire service in that state. Leaders of both the state and federal branches of the LNP in NSW have ignored the advice of experts in their own governments and outside of it to increase the number of qualified caretakers. This aspect has been downplayed in favour of saying nothing could've prevented the fires.  Fuel loads are indeed an issue and have been addressed, but as a hazard reduction strategy, reducing fuel loads by burning off has its limitations. There are human factors to consider - potential loss of property if the blaze gets out of control, health issues if the smoke from burnoffs lingers for long periods of time - as well as environmental: Basically, the weather isn't always suitable for burning off fuel. Too wet and nothing burns. Too hot and the burnoff may turn into a bushfire, the exact thing the burn was trying to prevent.  Is climate change to blame? It will have an impact on drying out existing fuel even further. Plant material that would may not have been dry enough will be that tiny bit more drier. And fuel that is ready to burn will become even more combustible and burn hotter. Rising temperatures have a direct effect on fire intensity as well as the length of the bushfire season i.e. the times of highest risk.

The 1851 fires hit 5 million hectares of land in Victoria, the article literally also says no reliable source of information existed at that time so idek why you're bring this up, but the 2019-20 fires have already hit 10million hectares and the fire season hasn't even hit it's worst yet (historically this happens in February)   The biggest issue coming out of this modern era has been heralded as one of its strengths - the fact that everyone has access to information in theory is a great thing. The issue comes in people unable to correctly interpret the information and data that they've been fed - making the wrong conclusions from what they've been given, it's realistically a lot more complex than people make it out to be and it's how we get people like Joanne, or all the well known climate deniers in Australian politics whose highest level of education is finishing highschool here"

If so, then we might want to talk about the reasons for that.  Increasing GHGs have the problem that the effect grows at a known logarithmic rate.  The only way the effect trends at an increasing rate is if the cause is trending at an even steeper increasing rate.  Our population is growing at an exponential rate, and our energy use is growing also.  Because energy use is typically higher than it was 150 years ago, and the population is growing at a known exponential rate, the resultant effect of those factors is that we see an increasing rate of warming and sea level rise.  We can't just assign ""exponential"" to the result, without unpacking the reasons for the observation.  In the developed nations, where 100 years ago we were growing in both population and energy use per person, we have now turned the corner and are no longer growing our population at all, and are in some cases reducing both population AND energy use per person.  As more nations reach higher levels of development, scientists expect to see them also peak and start heading back down, experiencing lower rates of population growth and energy use.  If you have a bell curve, or a periodic sinusoidal, the first 25% of that curve looks exponential, the second 25% looks logarithmic. Neither is actually true.  One can't take a look at the curve and ""decide"" that it's exponential growth based on the shape of graph.   Also, you should understand that X^2 is exponential, but X^.98 is also exponential, except that it indicates a decreasing trend over time.  Stop using math terms that you don't understand, when what you mean is ""it's bad."""

What you are suggesting is we sanction developing countries such as china until they get their emissions and pollution under control. What is that going to do? Progress is not really going to be made by arguing and fighting over who is emitting more. What it is going to do is cause countries to argue and fight is all. When taxes cracked down on Chinese goods they just simply shipped them to other countries (Malaysia, singapore, indonesia) and then shipped them from there on to the US without being taxed. I have seen this firsthand.  Cooperation and agreements and commitments to each other will get more done.

No one should ignore deforestation, loss of species diversity, release of CO2 locked in the oceans and ice due to increasing temperatures, etc, etc..  Climate change has a feedback loop to a degree that will continue to increase temperatures and CO2 levels even if all human emissions stop tomorrow."
deck_hand,2020-01-13 16:05:01,fe8viba,t3_eo14b2,t1_fe8u1l1,"&gt;Until we draw a line and tell the developing nations that increasing their pollution isn't acceptable anymore,  ""we draw a line and tell the developing nations that increasing their pollution isn't acceptable anymore.""    Currently, all of our ""international agreements"" have been ""developed nations! You suck!  Change your ways!  Give money to everyone who isn't already developed, because they are blameless saints and need your help.  Developing nations, feel free you use this money to increase your planet killing Emissions and develop faster, so that you can become the world leading economies that the Developed nations stole from you by developing first.""  How abut our international agreements start with ""we agree that any increase in GHGs will doom the world and cause millions of people to suffer and die. Therefore NO NATION should increase their emissions of GHGs from this day forward.  We will ALL, every one of us, agree to cap our emissions at our present level, and those who are the highest must commit to reducing the fastest.  Those with the lowest emissions can wait until the majority catches up before working hard to reduce, but no one should be increasing our polluting emissions.""  What's wrong with that?"
De5perad0,2020-01-13 16:08:47,fe8w7kv,t3_eo14b2,t1_fe8viba,Well the problem with that is what will you do to the first nation that says no we wont sign/do that. Which I guarantee there will be many that will say that.   How will you get them to sign that agreement? We cant even get the fucking US president to sign an agreement similar to that? (paris agreement)  I guarantee every developing nation will say we dont have the money to do that or etc etc excuse. So how will you get them to sign it? What will you do when they dont?
deck_hand,2020-01-13 16:17:52,fe8y6ks,t3_eo14b2,t1_fe8va5j,"&gt; There are a very very large number of things affecting and causing climate change.  Yeah, according to pretty much all of the push from the scientific community, the Climate Change advocacy groups, etc. there's a fairly limited number of reasons why we're warmer.   They are really pushing the idea that ""it's not natural,"" so all natural factors are out.  They are ""all in"" on the idea that it's the increase in GHGs in the atmosphere, primarily the increase in CO2, followed distantly by CH4, some NOx gases, some CFCs, and then some real trace gases.    The ""reason for the increase in GHGs"" that is given 99% of the time is mainly from the burning of fossil fuels, outgasing from cement curing, from fossil fuel wells and mines, and from increased soil decomp after deforestation.  That's not ""very very many,"" but rather a handful of reasons.  None of these reasons would not matter if there were only a million people on the planet, emitting at the average rate of humans today. So, population is a factor.  If we take 10 tons of GHG release over a million people, the planet would not even notice.  But, multiply that by 7 billion people, and all of a sudden it matters.  &gt;Climate change has a feedback loop to a degree that will continue to increase temperatures and CO2 levels even if all human emissions stop tomorrow.  Well, we're doomed, then, and there's nothing we can do about it."
GioCapri,2020-01-13 16:27:56,fe90gzo,t3_eo14b2,t1_fe8fnml,"That’s what u need to drive home. Folks with special interests like oil and deregulation want to fool the common man into thinking the issue is just the weather and is subjective and even debated by the leading experts when we know damn well it’s pollution. Maybe they don’t care about the effects of a warming climate, but they sure do care about their air, water, and food. Keep spreading the word. You’re right!"
Brawmethius,2020-01-13 16:30:44,fe912w2,t3_eo14b2,t1_fe7rlcw,"&gt; Tax the fuck out of plastic products.  Plastics have absolutely revolutionized the quality of life for billions of people. A tax simply increases cost. This might put a cost barrier on some of the more wasteful things, like excess wrapping, etc, to keep cost down. But realistically blanket taxes would just impact poorer groups of people, which cheap plastic goods have greatly helped (medical, hygiene, food prep/storage, MOCs... goes on).   Secondly, this doesn't even consider that plastics fit a very nice material niche that was previously held by metals and their alloys. Do you have a good metric of comparison what the impact would be to increase metal production? Mining isn't exactly environmentally friendly.  This plastic = bad is just nonsense. It is incredibly useful, has revolutionized our world and is incredibly energy efficient from raw material to final product. There is still more potential in our future for plastic products as well. Is there waste management issues and some bad practices out there? Oh yeah, absolutely. Primarily in food wrappings, drink containers, packaging. Such a very narrow subset of your ""blanket taxes"".   &gt;  Ban all unnesacary Plastik Produkts, any single use Plastik.  I mean at least this is more focused, but this now also includes all the wonderful single use plastics that have become staple in medical care and will continue to be the primary material to further reduce medical costs. Especially to poorer nations where sanitary conditions can be subject and cross use of medical equipment spreads infection and increases mortality rate. Also this would make your tax point of (1.) just tax primarily non-problematic plastic goods as the single-use category contains almost all of the main polluters. Also who gets to decide what is necessary?  Vague generalities that neither address the problem or solve it.   &gt; Stop giving welfare to oil industries.  Yeah absolutely, should be done. But subsidies do not make them produce more oil, they just make already profitable companies even more profitable. In an indirect way, this does free up cash to lobby, which they use in a malignant manner. So maybe it would reduce their lobbying budget... but since lobbying allows them to get welfare I would doubt this happens.   &gt; Tax oil Industry for the estimated costs of the disposal of their products for the lifetime of the product  You seem to not understand how a tax works. Costs are primarily passed onto consumers. Most oil products are relatively inflexible goods, so oil companies will pass this onto consumers. Especially if the tax is blanket between competitors. Consumer behavior may change around the increased cost. Not only this I do not understand how you moralize the burden exclusively onto oil companies. Do they do shady shit? Yes. Should they be held accountable for misinformation? Yes. Should they be held accountable for lobbying with misinformation to their own benefit? Yes. But at the end of the day they are a supplier to something people demand. It isn't an evil oil company forcing you to fill up your car with gas, or to drive on long trips, or to purchase fuel-inefficient cars. It isn't an evil company that turns on your AC when it is hot and heat when it is cold. Consumers drive production of goods, pretending this mess is the work of a handful of greedy men is asinine, untrue and not helpful for any meaningful discussion.  Effectively what I read here is ""make things to expensive for people to use and blame a handful of people for what we have done as a whole group""; what an amazingly well thought out solution. I can't believe the rest of us just couldn't work this out."

That's exactly what I said. ""Most"" means more than 50%.   &gt; Their best estimate is that humans have caused 100 percent of that global warming.  That's the Guardian's opinion, not the IPCC's.

(paris agreement)  I won't discuss the rational our current President has for not promoting heavy self-regulating agreements, but he's on record for saying that part of the reason is that the Paris Agreement seems to be more about transferring large amounts of cash from the US to developing nations without there being any requirement for the developing nations to use that money to do anything to reduce their own emissions growth rate.  Why would we agree to send money to other nations so that they can use the money to build coal-fueled power plants, while we are told to shutter all of our coal-fueled power plants?  How does that make any sense at all?  The [Paris Agreement](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/what-is-the-paris-agreement) says that we have a goal of keeping warming to below 1.5°C if possible (Article 2).  To achieve this goal, there is an agreement to peak emissions as soon as possible (Article 4).  It is noted that there is a recognition that developing nations will take longer to reach peak emissions than developed nations.   I should note here that the US has been post-peak since 2007.  The developed nations have yet to hit a peak.  China and India increased their emissions by about 5% just last year.    Article 4 also ""establishes binding commitments by all Parties to prepare, communicate and maintain a nationally determined contribution (NDC) and to pursue domestic measures to achieve them.""  How many decades should we watch the developing nations have NO measurable progress towards NDCs?    &gt;To set a firm foundation for higher ambition, each successive NDC will represent a progression beyond the previous one and reflect the highest possible ambition. Developed countries should continue to take the lead by undertaking absolute economy-wide reduction targets, while developing countries should continue enhancing their mitigation efforts, and are encouraged to move toward economy-wide targets over time in the light of different national circumstances.  So, developing nations, according to this Agreement, are encouraged to move towards economy wide targets over time...  We have reduction targets, they have economic ones.    &gt;The Paris Agreement reaffirms the obligations of developed countries to support the efforts of developing country Parties to build clean, climate-resilient futures, while for the first time encouraging voluntary contributions by other Parties.  Here's the main sticking point.  Developed nations, the US primarily, agree to pay developing nations to develop, while we should de-industrialize and seek to reduce our own economic strengths.  We agree to be bound to do this, while ""encouraging the voluntary contributions"" of those we're paying.  This is why Trump doesn't like this agreement."
De5perad0,2020-01-13 17:42:28,fe9gkhg,t3_eo14b2,t1_fe9eo2z,Nice way to latch on to one part of my comment and avoid the main question completely. I don't give a fuck about the details of the Paris agreement.  I'll ask again. What will you do when all the developing countries refuse to sign this agreement you are proposing?
deck_hand,2020-01-13 17:47:20,fe9hovj,t3_eo14b2,t1_fe9gkhg,"Dude, I don’t know. But, telling them to keep developing while we pay for it doesn’t seem to be working"

""No, it is killing the world""  I am sorry what is your qualification or basis of analysis of this? You make some very blanket statements, greatly generalized solutions based on what? How you feel about it?"
De5perad0,2020-01-13 18:05:42,fe9kshv,t3_eo14b2,t1_fe9hovj,The point im trying to make is there is no good answer right now but one thing that's for sure is that experts are saying that doing nothing to mitigate climate change will cost every country much much much more than it will to develop and make the changes necessary to resolve it.  This I imagine is the reasoning behind the Paris agreement. It is an investment to avoid massively larger costs later. I'm not going to argue if the money is our would be used correctly. Who the fuck knows. But the principle is still there and it needs to happen or shits going to get real expensive quick.   There is not a good answer to get developing nations to reduce their emissions when they don't have the money or the means. I imagine everyone at the Paris agreement is doing the best they can. I agree that it's not good enough tho.

If you say so.  I've seen economic breakdowns on how much is being spent on prevention, and how much will be needed for adaptation.  The result is that, for many nations, the cost of prevention is so high compared with what adaptation would cost, the nation could go bankrupt to save a tenth of a degree, while adapatation might not cost anything.  Let's take a concrete example.  What if it costs the US 30% of her GDP over the next 30 years to get to zero carbon emissions footprint.  We win, right?  Oh, but assuming that the top 10 developing nations don't even stop increasing their carbon footprint for the next 20 years, and we are left with 100% of the same adaptation costs afterwards.  What is the advantage of spending the money now?  Are we much better off with less money?  &gt;This I imagine is the reasoning behind the Paris agreement.   You imagine that, and I imagine somethign totally different.  I imagine that 150 nations of the world look over at the US and say, ""fucking rich bastards - why are they so rich while we aren't?  Oh, it's because we're exploited!  They make money off of our labor!!! We should force them to pay us some of their riches. What reason could we give?  Oh, climate change sounds nice. Yep, the world is going to end soon if you don't write us $300 billion in climate reparation checks.  We're not going to use that money to do anything about climate, we just want the money, so give it to us, okay?""  &gt;I'm not going to argue if the money is our would be used correctly.   Because you don't care.  We're rich, they aren't, and therefore that means we OWE them money.   Why should you care what use they are going to put to the money?  You don't even CARE of it's going to the climate, and that's a problem.  This is either about the climate, or it's just a cash grab.    &gt;But the principle is still there and it needs to happen or shits going to get real expensive quick.  You said, ""it needs to happen.""  What does?  We are reducing our emissions. That's what you said needs to happen.  Paying developing nations to economically develop isn't reducing emissions. In fact, paying developing nations to have more rich people to drive cars, buy bigger houses with larger energy needs is the opposite of what will ""fix"" anything.  Unless we have some sort of idea that the money is being spent to reduce emissions, it is actually counterproductive to pay them this money right now.    &gt;I imagine everyone at the Paris agreement is doing the best they can.  I imagine they just want free money."

They have less gdp and co2 per Capita.   It's a lot less of a financial hit on developed countries - suffering losses for combating emissions.
deck_hand,2020-01-13 20:35:51,feaelru,t3_eo14b2,t1_feaaqg9,"China agreed to continue increasing CO2 emissions until 2030.  They agree to ""best efforts"" for peaking before that.  Binding agreement?  Nah, just no promises to even try.  The EU (not a country, but...) agrees to   &gt;At least a 40% domestic reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.   How is the EU doing at this?  [not bad](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/news/eu-track-implement-paris-commitments-member-states-preparing-2030-energy-and-climate-plans_en).    &gt;The European Union reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 22% between 1990 and 2017,   From 1990 to 2030 is 40 years, 30 of those years have elapsed, meaning we have 10 years left.  They are a bit over halfway to the target, with 25% of the time left to achieve their goal.  It could happen. They just need to increase the rate of conversion by a bit, achieving an 18% reduction in 10 years, where it took them 30 years to get to a 22% reduction.    The article goes on to say, ""With the policies already in place in the 28 Member States, EU emissions are projected to decrease by 30% by 2030.""  But, of course, 30% isn't 40%.  &gt;A 33-35% reduction in emissions intensity by 2030, compared to 2005 levels.   India plans to be more efficient in creating money when they emit. Not reduce their emissions, just get richer through doing so.  How will they meet this target?  partially through getting money from other countries to pay for it.    Brazil   &gt;A 37% reduction in emissions by 2025, compared to 2005 levels, with a further indicative target of a 43% reduction in emissions by 2030.   Damn, Brazil is bringing it.  We're just 5 years away from 2025, and they promise to be 37% lower emissions than 2005.  How are they doing?  Not good.  Instead of lowering emissions since 2005, they will more likely double their emissions.  We should not only pay attention to the promises, but also the adherence to the commitments, right?  I can CLAIM to want to reduce, but if I double my emissions instead of cut them in half...  The rest are similar, honestly.  The developed nations are reducing, after promising to reduce.  The developing nations are either making no promises at all, or are not even coming close to following through."

It's one of the things the US and China both bragged about a few years ago.  India is modernizing, and as such, the productivity is higher due to efficiency gains. Not surprising, but also has nothing to do with actually reducing emissions.   I also noticed a LOT of the promises were to reduce emissions from ""business as usual"" projections.   Just so that you know, this isn't from ""what we are doing now,"" but rather from the RCP 8.5 projection model.  This model assumes a return to all coal.  No natural gas, no renewables, unregulated and thus unrealistically poor gasoline and diesel fuel economy on all vehicles.  It's a ""absolute worst case"" scenario.  It would be very difficult to actually break even on that scenario, and thus fairly easy to show reductions when compared with it.  It's like I was on a diet, and I had several scenarios, one of which was that I would eat a whole box of cereal for breakfast, a whole chicken for lunch, and a steak dinner, plus three deserts, for dinner.  Then, I compare my ""weight loss"" against projected gains of that scenario.  It's really that bad."

As for China, I think they are a lot more developed and probably will peak within a decade or two.  Most of the emissions increases won't come from those two in the near future though - they'll come from the other poor Asian countries if I recall correctly.

Brawmethius,2020-01-13 22:00:21,feaw8u2,t3_eo14b2,t1_feaprrj,"Not a shred of science in your points. It also isn't an exclusively scientific problem, it is also an economic one and a social one. Especially when you want to restrict goods that improve the life of billions and increase costs for them. It changes everything, on every level.  My point is incredibly simply, you have not done a single shred of meaningful thought or consideration.   No one is denying pollution is an issue; but no one defended pollution ~~other~~either. This came out of addressing your stupid solutions that are literally meaningless. How fucking full of yourself do you need to be to think that you can just off the top of your head spit out ""the quick easy solution"" for one of the most important industries in the world since 1940. Reading your comments reads like the click-bait you probably spend most your time reading.   There is an opportunity cost for everything, and I don't think you have even gotten to the point you can comprehend what that would mean; let alone offer a meaningful approach. ""Tax and regulate"" is the chant of a dumbass who wants to feel good about a problem but doesn't actually understand it.   &gt; You asking a random on reddit to prove what's wrong with the world and how to solve it?  No... you came out and asserted how easy it was to solve it.... and well it read like utter and complete bullshit. Which would be very inline with what you said... I do not expect a random redditor to know fucking jack all, and well here we are. Not much of a critical thinker are you.  But on the off chance you do want to learn something instead of just telling people how you feel. Here is some things about plastic that may help your future decisions.  Pro's.  - Incredible material properties that have opened up a whole new world of technology and manufacturing. (3D printing being one of the most recent horizons, ability to MFG necessary goods on local removes supply chain and energy consumption CO2).   - Lightweight while sharing very varied properties (see above) has lead to weight reduction in a huge amount of goods around the world. The fuel efficiency of modern cars for example, would literally not be possible with out plastic. In addition, transporting goods in our modern economy is a major contributor to CO2 and our energy budget, making things lighter means it is literally less energy to transport.  - Replaced many expensive metals; exponentially reducing the energy footprint to produce the equivalently functional material.  - Energy pathway from raw material to usable material for plastics is significantly lower than alternate metals (including recycled metal); recycling cost for compatible plastics outperform metals as well.   - Huge application to renewable and sustainable. Sorry to break it to you bud, building shit with out plastics is expensive and makes it costly to pursue improvements.   - Revolutionized food packaging and storage; greatly reducing waste as well as as keeping products sanitary.  - Crazy versatile, can be made into construction materials, components, filters, probes, cloth, you goddamn name it.  - Huge potential to be recycled, biodegradable and sustainable sourced.  - Dirt fucking cheap and easily molded/manipulated; resulting is a plummet of cost in basic goods. Especially in the medical field, where single use components allow for cheaper access to basic health care.   Cons  - Thanks to their wonderful material properties they don't break down well. But plastics are such a huge category of materials and this is a hot issue, so this con might not be around for ever; but it is a major one for the bulk plastic already manufactured.  - So fucking dirt cheap (yeah this shows up twice); that there is no cost incentive to recycle most.   - Waste is poorly managed and many plastic additives were used before fully understanding their impact.  - Breaks down into micro particles and can easily enter ecosystems (to specific types).  The overwhelming vast majority of ""pollution"" plastic is used for packaging. Simply addressing this portion of waste would completely change plastic as a polluter. (But no not eliminate it... I got some bad news for you bud, people living = pollution).   Instead of just shitting out your opinions as ""science"" go learn something.   Source: Actual person competent with science, economics and production. Chemical Engineer in manufacturing. So you know, I get to look at how things like plastics impact production costs, what their material supply chain looks like, what alternate costs look like and just in general working through a problem critically; because I do it for a living."

Helkafen1,2020-05-23 22:11:51,frl8zcc,t3_gpcl6c,t3_gpcl6c,"The greenhouse effect is caused by the absorption of certain wavelengths by the atmosphere.  Some gases are more effective at absorbing these wavelengths. CO2 is one of them, so if we increase the relative concentration of CO2 the greenhouse effect will be stronger.  If we increase the amount of every gases, without changing the relative abundance of each gas (i.e we increase density), the greenhouse effect will also be stronger.  On Earth, what's happening is the first phenomenon. Density is pretty much constant, and we're increasing CO2 concentration."
funkybullschrimp,2020-05-23 22:14:22,frl98yx,t3_gpcl6c,t3_gpcl6c,"I mean, first of all, I'd tell ya not to argue with people over the internet, it rarely has any effect other than making both of you feel frustrated. And then second of all, I'd tell you to not ask Reddit, and instead, go to your local uni/high school and ask a science/earth/climate teacher, or just send em an email. They're generally really nice people, and they're much better at explaining these things because well, it's their job to do so. Plus, they'd be much more accurate because instead of 4 minutes of reading a wiki page, they have a real degree under their belt.   &amp;#x200B;  Here's my take on it, but again, I'm a student, I don't have a bachelor nor a master in anything anywhere near climate science, if you really want a cohesive reply and ask all the questions you want, ask someone qualified.   He's right, technically. The density of Co2 in the air does not directly affect the greenhouse effect. What Co2 does, is it absorbs infrared photons (pretty much equatable to ""warmth) and then re-emits them. Density has \*an\* effect, but it isn't \*the\* effect. If two test setups are equal but one is less dense, the more dense one might have a worse greenhouse effect because the relative chance that the light will hit the CO2 is higher. But that isn't the reason why higher PPM numbers are worrying.  Density is calculated with two variables, the amount of CO2, and the amount of space it can be in. However, since the earth atmosphere has a relatively constant size, the amount of space it can be in doesn't actually change. As a result, unless you can demonstrate that the earth's atmosphere is somehow shrinking/losing air, a higher PPM directly equates to a higher total mass of CO2 in the air, which means more infrared being absorbed.   What happened to Venus isn't what happened with the earth. It's what's called a run-away greenhouse effect. In Venus's case it was (probably) caused by the fact that the sun got way hotter (long long long ago). This led to a positive feedback loop, which pretty much evaporated all the water, which only made it worse. Eventually leading to such a strong effect, that Venus became the way it is now. The solar system is incredibly interesting, but suggesting that the sun is the cause of our climate change is simply false."

As others have said, sunlight comes to Earth and warms the surface.   This warmth is reemitted as infrared radiation.   This emission is why we do not get infinitely hot, the incoming is balanced by the outgoing.   But some of that outgoing infrared is absorbed by the gasses in the atmosphere and re-emitted downwards, this heats the surface a bit more.

I was wrong in saying the greenhouse effect theory is based on density alone. While density plays a part, it is not the main player.  However, it's apparently also undeniable that the theory is totally incorrect. You can even prove it at home: Take 2 sealable containers, put 2 thermometers in it, and, in any way possible, add CO2 to one (vinegar, baking soda, or a really deep breath). Put both in the dark to equalize their temperatures, and then expose them to the sun and see which container heats up faster.  Your Mars example is not valid due to Mars being much further away from the sun ans having a much thinner atmosphere. The effects of CO2 here will be far greater than in Mars.  If you want to deny that the situation is really bad, then ok. But you really can't deny the greenhouse effect theory itself, it seems."

LackmustestTester,2020-05-24 18:08:43,froqqjo,t3_gpcl6c,t1_frmnmco,"So, now you know what´s the greenhouse theory is about.  So, let´s look how a real greenhouse works:  In a real greenhouse Light penetrates the glass of the greenhouse, heats its floor and then, by conduction and convection, the air above, which remains trapped in the glass building. It's warmer inside than outside. This heat stored in the trapped air has nothing to do with the phenomenon, which is nonsensically called the same in climatology! The heat in the ""greenhouse"" - warm air that is trapped and cannot escape because of the cover of a closed room - could also be experienced in a tin hut in the blazing sun, through whose opaque shell no light falls into the interior.  The atmosphere is an open system, so that´s the first misconception. The atmosphere, more precisly, the water vapor is **cooling** the surface, the so called global warming is in reality 'a little less' cooling.  The next misconception is the idea of an additional surface re-heating by re-emitted IR to the surface. 1st it is [0violating the 2nd law of thermodynamics](https://redd.it/f4gwep) (a colder body can´t warm a warmer one), 2nd it´s all based on assumptions and models based on these assumptions. What´s still [missing is a repeatable, physical experiment](https://redd.it/dqsapq) that shows the claims are correct. There are experiments that show the greenhose effect, respectivly the CO2 of the atmosphere has negligible influence, if any.  Arrhenis made his predictions in 1896 (he thought more CO2 would be beneficial fur humankind, all he cared about was if the resources would last for the next generations - see the parallels to today, e.g. Club of Rome?) and [Wood](https://redd.it/ejj61l) showed in 1909 with an [repeatable experiment](http://www.biocab.org/Experiment_on_Greenhouses__Effect.pdf) the greenhouse effect doesn´t exist.  Here is a good explanation by an [physicist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5bwaf9QXro&amp;feature=youtu.be).  If you want to know something about [data fiddling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8455KEDitpU) you should watch this.  Edit: Just in case you are going to tell me there is a [97 % consensus](https://redd.it/deniq3). There is no such thing in science."
RegularOldPsychopath,2020-05-24 18:42:16,frourzz,t3_gpcl6c,t1_froqqjo,"&gt;The atmosphere is an open system, so that´s the first misconception.  With a simple explanation that we're simply pumping out CO2 faster than the atmosphere gets rid of it.  &gt;The next misconception is the idea of an additional surface re-heating by re-emitted IR to the surface.  See, this is *kind of* aligned with what we've been seeing the comments say, but also not really. What you're saying is that IR light is being reflected by the surface into the atmosphere and afterwards being reflected back, but due to the laws of thermodynamics, not warming anything due to having lost heat in the process (at least that's what I think you're saying, it sounds like it).  But the general consensus from what I've heard (the comment section does not adress this however so up to debate) is that the greenhouse gases aren't high up in the atmosphere enough to cool down by much once they return to the surface after being reflected.. This, in turn, means there is more hot air in the troposphere, the layer of the atmosphere we live in, resulting in a warming of maybe not the surface itself but definately the air around the surface.  Of course, you could always challange this saying the gases are not that close, for which we'd have to make *another* post to confirm.  Now, as for the experiment:  1- The experiment was verified thrice according to the file you sent and only twice did it yield the same results. That's a step in the direction of experimental reproductivity, but I wouldn't quite call it reproducable just yet.  2- The result of the experiment was that the containing of heat was not due to trapped radiation, but due to blockage of convective heat transfer. Fair enough, but what if in the atmosphere, gases released by us are causing that blockage of convective heat transfer? I'm not sure how this could be tested without being expensive as hell, but this theory hilariously brings us full circle back to density, which we have established with the comment section that plays a part, just not a, as far as the comments know, big one. It does, however, make some sense, when you think about it: A thick, dense layer of gas between the surface and the rest of the atmosphere by any gas really could potentially cause that blocking effect of heat transfer. As we know, higher material density means lower thermal conductivity.  Edit: 3- What about the experiment I shared, reproducable and yieldinf results supporting the greenhouse effect? The exact air composition, the exact material, the exact exposure time to sunlight, however the container with more CO2 is hotter. How?  And finally, the video. I don't know the scientist and don't usually have an hour to spare to watch it, but I'll try to watch it sometime."

There are experiments that show the greenhose effect, respectivly the CO2 of the atmosphere has negligible influence, if any.  1st, it's not violating the 2nd Law, because the CO2 is not actively heating the earth. Imagine two large metal blocks in thermal contact. You heat the opposite side of one with a blow torch. The first block is warmer because the second block re-radiates heat back but the opposite side of block two is colder.  2nd, it is not based on assumptions and models. This is a measured phenomenon. Using spectrometers both on the surface and in space we can see which wavelengths are being reflected back and which are going out into space and at what intensities. So again, this is an observation not a model or assumption."

The Wood experiment says that the heating from a greenhouse is caused by blockage of the heat transfers, not trapped radiation. Fair enough, but what if in our atmosphere it's the greenhouse effect gases that cause that blockage of heat transfers?  The thing is, you seemed to already know this before I even said it as one of your counterpoints before I wrote that was that hot air which was already reflected by the surface of the earth cannot heat it again due to having lost heat on the way being reflected up and down againt by the greenhouse effect gases. Again, fair enough, but what if the greenhouse effect gases are deflecting heat at a low altitude (In the troposphere or low stratosphere)?

I particularly like [Sunrise Movement ](https://www.sunrisemovement.org/about) but they really stress grass roots organizing, so your experience may vary depending on what the hub near you is like. Either way, I don't think we get very far trying to save the world all by ourselves.

Harries, Helen E. Brindley, […]Richard J. Bantges  Nature volume 410, pages355–357(2001)  Abstract The evolution of the Earth's climate has been extensively studied1,2, and a strong link between increases in surface temperatures and greenhouse gases has been established3,4. But this relationship is complicated by several feedback processes—most importantly the hydrological cycle—that are not well understood5,6,7. Changes in the Earth's greenhouse effect can be detected from variations in the spectrum of outgoing longwave radiation8,9,10, which is a measure of how the Earth cools to space and carries the imprint of the gases that are responsible for the greenhouse effect11,12,13. Here we analyse the difference between the spectra of the outgoing longwave radiation of the Earth as measured by orbiting spacecraft in 1970 and 1997. We find differences in the spectra that point to long-term changes in atmospheric CH4, CO2 and O3 as well as CFC-11 and CFC-12. Our results provide direct experimental evidence for a significant increase in the Earth's greenhouse effect that is consistent with concerns over radiative forcing of climate."

Water vapor is indeed a very strong and important greenhouse gas. It's also very short lived in the atmosphere.  I think a key aspect you may be missing is that the greenhouse effect is not *caused* by human activity, it just happens given certain atmospheric conditions e.g. Venus having a higher average temp than mercury. If there was zero greenhouse effect on Earth the average temp would -18°C and oceans would be coated in ice. The balance of the greenhouse effect is what is affected by additional carbon dioxide.  But, like you said, water is a very strong greenhouse gas. Adding carbon dioxide increases the effect, and then is compounded by the additional water vapor from evaporation.  I don't know what you mean by ""not a real greenhouse effect"" since the *measured* effect on surface temp is that is causes higher temperatures. Perhaps you're mixing up surface temperatures with upper atmosphere?"
LackmustestTester,2020-05-25 20:20:29,frsuyge,t3_gpcl6c,t1_frstmbm,"&gt; Venus  The high temperatures there are caused by the high pressure, 92 bar. Earth has 1 bar. The -18° is a theoretical value that doesn´t fit reality because earth is not in an vacuum. Greenhouse effect is plain wrong, it´s about the heat capacity and behaviour of gases, basic thermodynamics.  The main point of the theory is the **re-heating** of the surface and this is not possible. Look at Trenbarth´s [energy budget](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John_Fasullo/publication/257564838/figure/fig1/AS:339975984959489@1458067999322/The-global-annual-mean-earths-energy-budget-for-2000-2005-W-m-2-The-broad-arrows.png).

Plus, ""climate variability"" doesn't mean the erradicatiom of an entire season in 10 years. Hell, less than that, I rounded that as a high estimate.  The accelerated sea level rise was correct but became kind of wrong with time. Remember that huge hole in the Ozone layer over Antartica? That was apparently causing Antartica to melt *fast*, causing a huge sea level rise. HOWEVER, this hole was accounted for in time and is now a shade of its former self, with some claiming it's actually fully closed by now. Action prevented a crisis. Of course, sea level rise is still acellerated, but by FAR less, due to the North pole still melting.  The stories of more natural disasters and occurances are actually hard to check. You can't claim they're all false, due to vague reports from the past, but you can't claim they're all real, due to vague reports from the past.  A big example of this is the bushfire thing: Many people say that bushfires are actually lowering in occuramce due to burned land in hectars before being much higher than now, but what they forget is that we did not have proper fire fighting forces in the past, and with the formation of these fires began to be much less desteuctive. However, due to this it's difficult to check if the frequency of bushfires has increased or decreased: On one hand, it might have decreased, because much less burned land. On the other hand, it might have increased, because even with proper, modern firefoghting forces, bushfires have been (very recently) increased in frequency (take it from a Portuguese person, we're ravaged by them every year by now).  I can safely say there is no climate skepticism website in Portuguese, but we have a good reason for this that is nof climate: Ecologist and economic interests go hand in hand in Portugal. We have no source of fossil fuels, so it's in our best interest to end dependancy on them due to the economic burden of importing them (and this has been a staggering success with over half our energy consumption now coming from clean renewable sources), production of minimalist designs for products both reduce their cost by reducing the amount of material consumed per product and their polluting power by reducing the amount of material disposed, recycling speaks for itself."

And A) Wind energy B) It's Iberia and it's a whole country, there is ALWAYS wind.  Edit: I also forgot to mention, production of renewable energy during day-time creates a surplus of energy, which feeds us during the night too. This is how we spent 4 whole days on nothkng but clean renewable energies.  And hydroelectricity here in Portugal is actually a really interesting topic:  Our history with hydroelectricity dates all the way back to the 30's. At the time, we were being ruled by a nigh-facist dictator, close to fascism, but distant enough to merit his own ideology name: Salazarism. His name was, of course, Salazar.  You see, we were neutral in WW2, and unlike Spain, had not been ravaged by a civil war. And we used our neutrality to get some sick trade deals with both the Allies and the Axis. I could stay here all day talking about Portugal's role in WW2, but that's a story for another time.  Point is, we got a lot of money from the War, getting our own national gold reserves. And because we were so wealthy, we decided to put it to use. We wanted to focus on development of the country, for that we need energy, and since A: We were good friends with Spain, who controlled the ources of 4/5 of our major rivers B: Spain was in no position to harm this plan due to being busy rebuilding the country C: The rivers were actually stable and not weak due to climate change, we decided a good say to account energy was to build a lotta dams.  This worked, and for quite a while. But then, it began to fail as Spain did exactly the same, and since they control the sources to most of our major rivers, we began to not get enough water. That's ok, we'll make an agreement with Spain to pour out enough water to water us. And it continued to work, untill Spain could no longer pour out enough water to water us without endangering itself in the process, as climate change began to tear away at the rivers.  Today, the topic is a source of tension between Portugal and Spain, but recently it's been mended temporarily by some helpful rain. Needless to say, we've started to try and reduce reliance on hydroelecrticity too.  Anyways, I could tell you about this all day, but if there's one thing you can't argue with, it's numbers. And knowing that 55 to 60% of all of Portugwl's electricity is produced by clean and renewable sources, and a plan to become completely clean and renewable on the energetic front by 2030, I have reason to believe we are doing just fine here."

RegularOldPsychopath,2020-05-27 22:29:57,fs0zmsg,t3_gpcl6c,t1_fs0rhks,"This is all well and good, but none of this explains how the climate is warming.  At this point, with the examples of American, Canadin, British, and Iberian origins, we've established the warming to be true, as it spans across 2 different continents.  So the paper proposes (I say proposes because let's face it, he may be a professor but he's only one professor compared to the other professors who do believe this is true and whom he conveniently denies, actually he denies a lot of commonly known things for no real reason and with no real backing other than his own professorhood, curiously making this a possible example of the very influence of the masses that he lowkey criticizes, especially if we add in the political ramblings), if I understand it right, that climate change is caused by the trapping of infrared radiation and the blockage of convective heat transfers at the same time.  Interesting point given we established already only the second half of it is correct with the Wood experiment, but for the sake of staying on point, we'll ignore that.  So we've established 3 things already: 1- The climate IS warming (with the examples you cited we can add in part of Asia, making this span across 3 continents) 2- Climate change is caused by blockage of convective heat transfers by greenhouse gases 3- Water vapor is the biggest of these greenhouse gases (disclaimer: I am skeptical for this 3rd one as this is the only scientist I have ever heard of claiming water vapor is the biggest player).  Now only one question, conveniently skirted around by the paper, remains: How is the circle of water being broken in such a way it warms climate so drastically that 2 continents and a pet of a 3rd get their climates completely turned around in the span of 10 years.  As he says, there is a difference between climate changes and weather changes. Weather changes do NOT include the erradication of a season, so we can pretty safely put this on the side of climate changes.  And still that question remains.  Will remain for me untill tomorrow.  Edit: Oh, by the way, just to add somethin on, but this time on the more polittical side of the issue we had been avoiding perfectly untill that papet decided it just had to mix science with politics (always a big no no):  I don't know if he understands that industry automation will end factory employment anyways, meaning that no matter if we risk destroying the climate or saving it, his predicted crisis (economically unfounded btw, as his position stands on the assumption that low class citizens need factory work to get by. False, as today the tertiary sector (business and services) have replaced that role in the first world, a sector that does not harm climate) will happen anyways (it won't, refer to the previous note, but still).  It also doesn't help that his political point stands on the political elite being climate alarmists and the common citizen not being so, when in truth a five-minute conversation with the average voter and a look in a political news outlet of choice reveals the exact opposite is true."

Wind turbines are causing additional drought as new research finds. - This is why I mentioned the Eucalyptus tree: Good thinking is not well done.  * The only way to deal with it on local scales is to adapt. There is no global warmig (rural stations show a slight decline over the last 30 years, in central europe and the US), no global climate, no global crisis.

Sum the average temperaturs of different regions and make the average of those. Climate change means the collective rise of all these region's temperatures, meaning that this statement does not contradict anything really.  And you're gonna have to show source on that claim that wind and solar power is causing droughts.  As for your third point, refer to evrrything in the conversation. Rural stations do NOT show a slight decline (again, American rivers running dry, European weather warming in general, Canada and Britain warmer to the point of fertility), there isn't a global climate but that doesn't contradict the climate change theory anyways, and there is a crisis because climate is changing rapidly and brutally. And no, the only solution isn't to ""adapt"", because use logic. If excessive human intervention and action in Nature caused this, restricting human intervention and action in Nature will solve it. Not like other living species can ""adapt"" that fast anyways.  CO2 avoidancd does not help in the sense that doing just CO2 avoidance is like giving thoughts and prayers on a disaster: It's not enough. Sure, it does *something* (note: giving thoughts and prayers does not do anything, that was a bad analogy, sorry), but that's just one of a hundred problems. Sure, it's a stepping stone for solving the rest, but it's not the end of the climb.

There is an estimate if we burn all **fossile** fuels (known and assumed sources) the CO2 level would reach 800 ppm (we´re at 416 right now) in the end.  Note that fossile fuels are former life. There was a time on that planet with a thriving life at much higher temperatures and CO2 levels.

And sure, you can throw creely old man quotes at me all day, but you'll never disprove that deindustrialization IS the political wide of climate change, hence why I want to avoid it. But just as a final note: You can have industry and not causr air pollution for the most part, you know.  And A: Oil is former life, coal is only partially former life. B: You can't prove temperatures were higher back then and neither does it matter. Temperatures ok for them might not be ok for us or a lot of other animal species. Especially when climate change happens so fast a whole species of birds can no longer bear to be on the entirety of Iberia within 10 years, that's when you know things go too fat for animals, and even plants to adapt. Us humans are an exception because we have technology, but not other animals.  Bottom linr on your last paragraph: No they didn't, and that doesn't matter either, they were a whole different species and they had time to adapt to those changes, unlike animals will have now, evidenced by the examples already shown to you."

The article you posted is great, but puts the ""warming"" of the ocean into context of how much energy is received (and therefore emitted) each year.  I wanted to know, essentially, the percentage change of the whole.  There's X cubic meters of saltwater in the ocean, and we know a bit about the average temperature of the water, given the location of that water, the season, etc.  So, we should be able to tell about how much thermal energy the ocean contains.  I'm going to take a wild guess that the number is a LOT larger than the change in temperature.   I just looked for (and found) the formula.  It's the mass of the water (1000 for one cubic meter) times the temperature in Kelvin (we'll call it 280, for simplicity sake), times the ""heat capacity of water"" (4184).   That's like a billion joules for ONE CUBIC METER.    So, the scale of the change is likely to be microscopically small.  And, I suspect, the actual error of measurement is larger than the signal.  Or, do we really think they know how warm all of the cubic meters of the entire planet's oceans were in 1960 to within a thousandth of a degree?"

For example, heat can be extracted from the ice by loss of radiation or by another, colder medium. In a natural way or on our earth ice cannot become so cold. In the mesosphere there are ice clouds which should be about -120°C cold. **The coldest ice ""on the ground"" is in Antarctica and should be around -90°C.**  &gt; The question was answered by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research, Bremerhaven.

Concludes, interestingly:  &gt;Even though the hypothesis of variations in cloud amount **could** explain the changes in SW radiation and the changes observed in the Transfer Entropy analysis, **it is not possible to guarantee that clouds are the only factor since climate is a highly interconnected system**, as reflected in the complexity of General Circulation Models.  That is, results are inconclusive. Funnily enough, it references lots of papers on climate change that agree that CO2 is the driver, but you didn't know that because you didn't read any of the papers.

But as multiple people have pointed out this is not so.  In fact your primary complaint seems to be that the number comes out huge in units of joules, as if climate scientists are to blame for the SI system using joules. Are you going to complain next that the Large Hadron Collider reports collision energies in units of Teraelectronvolts? Because you don't understand what the unit means it's their fault? Because the number is big and scary it's their fault?  You seem to be complaining that the energies reported are huge, (because they are!), as if scientists get to pick how much energy is entering the Earth system. You seem to be complaining that the graphic doesn't talk about changes in ocean temperatures instead, even though that's a) not the thrust of the graphic, [which obviously is intended to give a breakdown of how much energy is going to what parts of the climate system], and b) the topic of ocean temperatures is handled elsewhere in the report."

The amount of that energy is temperature, measured with a thermometer. The graph shows, whats happening in reality. The extra energy heats the different areas which reults in hiher temperatures.  And this can be measured in °C, for example - so 250 Zettajoules energy input lead to some warming. So the question is, how many °C is the positive temperature change?"
kytopressler,2020-06-05 17:55:16,fszug6a,t3_gw3w4q,t1_fszqfsu,"But again, why are you complaining that this specific graph doesn't show temperature instead of energy. It is simply impossible to demonstrate what this graph illustrates using temperature, because of the varying heat capacities of the materials involved.  You're complaining that a graph doesn't show things that are already addressed throughout that very chapter of the IPCC report. Your complaints simply don't make sense."
LackmustestTester,2020-06-05 18:20:53,fszxmdi,t3_gw3w4q,t1_fszug6a,"I´m not complaining about this graph. Having this one it should be possible to show the warming separatly, for example for the upper ocean because the heat capacity for water is known. Result should be a graph showing a warming trend in the upper ocean and how much it changed over the period."
PghChrisM,2020-06-06 21:59:52,ft73mgl,t3_gw3w4q,t1_fswwxvr,"Good, you are starting to learn something (I hope).  Notice there are two different words being used.  ""Hotness"" is not the same as ""heat"".  Heat is measured in Joules, Hotness in degrees F or degrees C, or sometimes degrees K.  It takes more heat to change the hotness of the ocean than it does the atmosphere.  Thus the ocean has absorbed an enormous amount of the extra heat we are trapping with anthropogenic CO2, but its temperature hasn't changed much.  The atmosphere has absorbed some of the heat, and its temperature has gone up over 1 degree C.  Your chart scares me (as someone who is alarmed about climate change) because it implies that the atmosphere is a minor component of this system.  The ocean is the real player here.  What will happen to the atmosphere if the ocean stops absorbing so much of the heat we're trapping?  For instance, the ocean turnover could slow down, so warm water isn't brought into the depths so much.  Your chart implies that if just one percent of the heat going into the ocean went into the atmosphere instead, it would heat up twice as fast.  That, to me, is a scary thought."
LackmustestTester,2020-06-06 22:14:27,ft76dpq,t3_gw3w4q,t1_ft73mgl,"What you are basically missing is the question what warms the ocean and that´s the problem because it´s not the atmosphere, that´s physically not possible (as long as the laws of physics are valid). So, in conclusion, nothing to be scared about."
PghChrisM,2020-06-06 22:22:09,ft77yv8,t3_gw3w4q,t1_ft76dpq,"CO2 acts like a blanket, not a heater.  The sun is the source of the heat, and how well the ocean can radiate it back out to space depends on how thick the blanket is.  I'm sorry, I thought that part was obvious."

PghChrisM,2020-06-07 01:41:41,ft85vw1,t3_gw3w4q,t1_ft7cxzy,"Yes, thank goodness H20 is the dominant greenhouse gas.  If CO2 was dominant, then raising CO2 by a factor of 1.5 already would have increased the temperature by 10% (because radiation goes as the fifth power of temperature) on the Kelvin scale, or about 27 degrees C.   So I'm curious.  It seems you are a climate skeptic; what part of the rather complex climate story doesn't make sense to you?  Climate scientists are in overwhelming agreement that we are causing climate change, and that change puts a significant number of people at risk of fires, droughts, floods, and water shortages.  As a scientist, I have great faith in science as the best way to understand our world and make predictions.  What parts are you skeptical about?"

Is it a comprehension problem or are you trying to pretend it's not there? Regardless, you're trying some very magical thinking here. Your ""logic"" seems to be:  * Solar activity increases * Increased insolation somehow passes directly through the atmosphere without warming it * The oceans warm from this increased insolation * The oceans then heat the atmosphere  That's bizarre to say the least, but you seem to feel the need to engage in all manner of mental contortions just to avoid the fact that CO2 absorbs and re-emits infrared radiation, accounting for all the warming we're seeing.

The IPCC also provides simple summaries of their key findings of the assessment reports. There's quite a few climate researchers here and on Twitter otherwise, so feel free to ask us. In Australia, check the CSIRO.  \- educate others. That's the hard part, but talk to others about how you feel. You will be shocked to discover who is a denier around you. But you will probably find like-minded people as well, and you can support each other. The most important people are those who never really thought about it and can be made aware.  \- change what you can control. Boycott companies that have a horrible climate track record (like H&amp;M), eat less meat or at least switch from beef to chicken, take the bike instead of (making your parents) drive. It is not enough for solving climate change, but it sends a message to companies and policy makers if enough people do it. It will really ease your anxiety though.  \- as soon as you can, vote."

BlueAndFlame,2020-07-03 19:40:26,fwu2afg,t3_hkfuxf,t3_hkfuxf,"Hi fellow Aussie, I read your post and just thought my own experiences can shed some light on what you’re feeling right now.  I graduated high school and studied petroleum engineering because my parents were convinced the world was running out of oil. I knew climate change was real, but peak oil was supposed to be more urgent at the time, so I thought I would save the world and make bank.   During the 2015 oil downturn, I started to have doubts that we were running out of oil. Then the Exxon Knew controversy happened. Then the Paris Climate Agreement was being signed. All the while the political messaging within my cohort and department became stronger and more defensive and my own research into the environmental, economical, political and technological issues further disillusioned me from the industry.   But nobody was taking me seriously, my parents thought I was being lazy and my lecturers thought I was too pessimistic. I eventually broke down and ranted at my parents for lying to me, and somehow managed to get through to them. I finally dropped out of the degree after three years. I spent the next several years being justifiably angry and depressed at the shitty hand I’d been dealt by society and my family, while my physical and mental health was ruined.  Fast forward to today, the bushfires happened, the pandemic crashed our demand for fossil fuels, the oil industry has lost 1.6 trillion dollars and is suffering mass layoffs once again, peak oil has been debunked, OPEC has never been weaker, renewables and EVs have never been more competitive, countries around the world and particularly in Europe are implementing even greater carbon taxes, Shell and BP have written down assets by 22 and 30 billion dollars respectively, climate denial is now shunned in Australia and my parents have since apologised. I’m about to finish therapy and move on to a happier stage of my life in the tech industry.  I guess the takeaway is that no one can see the future. No one can predict the economy, or the weather, or a pandemic. But what doesn’t change, in my opinion, is our principles and our vision for a better world. My advise, take it or leave it, is to not worry about money too much and follow your heart, because I sure wish I did that from the very start."
apatheticonion,2020-07-04 00:45:34,fwuxx7s,t3_hkfuxf,t1_fwsmhf2,It's really sad but we are actually so far off solving it that it's hard to fathom.   I seriously doubt we have the collective sensibilities to address climate change.

Things that I can control:  - writing to local politicians to inform them about my concerns. I send letters since I think emails are too easy to ignore. - also writing to institutions like banks, to tell them about my concerns as a consumer and where I'm willing to spend my money and why - Growing veges, spending less,, reusing more and generally shielding my family from an unpredictable world.

Insquidious1,2020-07-05 00:43:42,fwyekhi,t3_hlbidq,t1_fwybqm0,"There is no value in it. The paper already exists, these papers do not have trouble being found by people who are going to read them. People who are going to actually read the article will find it by their own research process. Unless an explanation is provided or some kind of discussion initiated around the paper then it is akin to walking into a room of people, dumping a textbook on the table, and walking out without a word said.  There are many posts like this and they serve very little purpose and most of them end up with no comments or interaction. This is because perhaps only one or two people actually read the bloody things. I mean READ the things as well, not glance at the abstract and assume they know what they are talking about.  Edit: To clarify, I don't want my tone to sound flippant, these things are hard to get across in writing. I genuinly feel from a forum curation standpoint these posts have little value."

Insquidious1,2020-07-05 01:53:12,fwykiwz,t3_hlbidq,t1_fwyekhi,"Last reply to myself here and I will stop commenting on the matter, certainly it would seem my view is an edge case opinion. Also my previous reply was overly flippant, arrogant and poorly commuincated.  I genuinely think these posts would be substantially improved even by a short sentence or two, either in the title or in the actual content.  Even something as simple as ""What are people's thoughts on the findings of this study?"" Or question's about the study they want answered (posts that ask questions are amongst the best posts on this sub in my opinion), or perhaps their opinon on the study, which people might then be able to discuss. Something which actually initates something.  I just think it would make for clearer comunication and add a somewhat more discussive vibe to posts on this sub. This is not a problem exclusive to this sub by any means, in fact it is a wider problem I have with Reddit as a whole. I think it is one (of several) reasons we see Reddit has become such an environment of people just posting inane thoughts about news articles with little nuance or actual discussion. Even more so than it was in the past. I also see that tackling such a problem could add a signficant moderation load. Which is probably the reason most subs don't require something like that from their posts. This is my argument from a forum curation standpoint.  The other problem with these kind of posts, *I suspect* (but admitedly have no evidence) most people will not read the article. I'd be interested to know the clickthrough rates on people who just view the post vs. people who actually click through to read the article. The number that then actually read the material is going to be lower again. Further, I suspect the number of readers on this sub who have sufficient relevant experience to be able to fully interpret these papers is going to be the minority. **Please do not take this as an arrogant ""hur dur people stupid"" comment.** If someone put a technical manual on how to build a rocket ship in front of me I would have not have sufficient experience or knowledge to read it. If I did, the danger is someone down the line would ask me a question about rocket ships, I would tell them something I misinterpreted in the rocket ship manual, and then that misinformation gets passed on in the grand game of chinese whispers that is life. Or worse they blow themselves up trying to build a rocket ship based on what I said.  In part because of this, I have a concern that these kind of posts of academic papers like this can end up facilitiating significant miscomunication of scientific findings. If we end up with such a post, where some kind and more informed reader on the topic has posted a reply about the article, which is well written and digestible for a lay reader, then there isnt a problem. This is not always the case however, and such posts can end up just being a collection of poorly informed ""hot takes"" on the paper which has little value but to end up miscommuincating climate science. We could end up in a situation where these posts end up facilitating miscomunication, not always maliciously or purposefully, although sometimes this is so. If I might be so bold to say so, I actually think the intent with this post is exactly the kind of malicious miscommuincation i'm referring to (based on the posters history on this and other subs, it seems u/WikiBox has identified this as well). **If something has been posted with a more malicious intent or hoping to confuse or miscommuincate to someone; it is more likely to become apparant if they themselves have to comment on the posted material.** Having to provide some content on posts is of course not a be all and end all solution, but I think it would make such posts eaisier to identify.  Something else to consider with these kind of papers, access to the paper is not consistent. If the paper is not open access most of the readers do not actually have to read material is being linked. This can result in difficulty in holding arguments about the subject matter to account. I came up against this problem myself yesterday, on the post about the sea level benchmark, I provided a link that would provide excellent detail on that last 6ka of Tasmanian sea level. That link however is behind a paywall which completely undermined the ability to have a proper discussion about it.

Although at least that post did ask a question in it's title, although it was clearly an attempt to revive a long dead sea-level rise denial argument.  To be clear I don't mean to violate rule 2 here. I think it is quite a good sub in fact, I just think this would go towards making it a little bit better, even in a small way. Given this is a field of science that sees perhaps greater effort made to undermine it than many others, I feel it is important to consider the potential ramifications of technical scientific papers being posted with little comment or explanation. I am just voicing an opinion that I think would be wise to hold these posts to a higher scrutiny for this reason. I do not have all the solutions and appreciate these are not easy issues for moderators to tackle or to devise solutions.

The CAM5LE model used in the paper has a present day aerosol forcing diagnosed at about -1.5W/m2 compared with AR5 best estimate of -0.9W/m2. This means net non-ODS forcing over 1955-2005 in CAM5LE is significantly smaller than in the AR5 forcing history. Hence adding ODS on top makes more difference.  As a corollary it should be noted that their fraction is determined by comparison between an ""all forcings"" simulation with ""all forcings minus ODS"" and if you did the same thing for all other GHGs the sum of fractions would total much larger than all the warming.  Point being that ODS contributing 1/3 global warming in these terms would not mean e.g. CO2 contribution is limited to a maximum of 2/3. It could be larger than all the warming."
skeeezoid,2020-07-05 11:41:15,fwznwrv,t3_hlbidq,t1_fwyvxxl,"CMIP5 and CMIP6 models already include ODS. ODS were included back to Hansen's 1988 projections.  See my other comment. If you did the same analysis on CO2 rather than ODS you would get a result that CO2 caused near 100% of the warming. This is because there is a large negative forcing from aerosols in the equation. If you sum all the warming factors you get an amount which is greater than all the warming.  Edit: e.g. if a + b - c = d, and a=2, b=4, c=3 then 2 + 4 - 3 = 3  Based on the paper under discussion ""a"" would be found to cause 2/3 of the result ""d"". Your assumption is that this must mean ""b"" can only cause a maximum of 1/3 of the result, but we can see that you're wrong. ""b"" actually causes 4/3 of the result in these terms."
shaunw666,2020-07-05 12:13:41,fwzpzms,t3_hlbidq,t1_fwzmzhg,(genuine question) is this why the models don't match observed temps ?  (see link in my comment below))
skeeezoid,2020-07-05 12:39:45,fwzrtaj,t3_hlbidq,t3_hlbidq,"There's some interesting history to think about concerning these factors. Up until the 1970s basically CO2 was the only thing talked about with regards human causation of climate change. In the early-mid 1970s it became recognised that particulate aerosols caused by human activity were also causing climate changes, but most likely in the negative direction, so CO2 and aerosols were basically counteracting each other.  It was only in the late 1970s when it became widely understood that CFCs were very strong greenhouse gases as well as causing Ozone depletion. Measurement sites for atmospheric CFC concentrations had been in place since the mid-70s and by the early 80s it became clear these things were rising rapidly. Worse still, chemical companies were continually introducing new gases for various processes, which were also rapidly proliferating. If you look at projections from the early 1980s, which is when Hansen's 1988 scenarios were drawn up, based on what was happening at the time it was considered entirely plausible that CFCs plus similar synthetic gases could rival CO2 as the dominant warming cause in the not-too-distant future (i.e. now).  One point being made by the linked paper is that CFCs were a significant factor in warming and it would have been so much worse if the Montreal Protocol had not come into force. Less often noted (almost never noted) is the role played by the Global Warming Potential metric, introduced at around the same time, and the light shone on these things by scientific research. CFCs were replaced with alternative gases, and in fact there are probably now an order of magnitude more of these synthetic gases used internationally for various human industrial and other purposes than there were when the Montreal Protocol was signed.  The reason why this proliferation of gases has not resulted in a major problem for the climate (though they remain a significant issue) is that it has become routine for chemical companies to rate all their products according to their global warming potential **and atmospheric lifetime** and minimising these factors is now an intrinsic part of design criteria.  Think about the potential implications if we not only hadn't implemented the Montreal Protocol but if we now had 10 times as many gases all with similar global warming potentials **and atmospheric lifetimes** to those CFCs."
skeeezoid,2020-07-05 13:33:26,fwzw2gj,t3_hlbidq,t1_fwzpzms,"Simple answer is no. Even if were the case that models didn't match observed temperature change this paper wouldn't have anything to say about that since it is entirely based on models which implement ODS in basically the same way as the models which supposedly don't match observed temperature change.  The graph you link has several issues. [Here](http://www.realclimate.org/images//cmp_cmip5_sat_ann-3.png) is a better representation of the surface temperature comparison updated to 2019. Problems with your linked graph:  1) Baseline choice. 1979-1983 was a period of strongly positive ENSO activity so we would expect observations to be biased high relative models in that period. Tying both together during that period therefore results in an observational low bias relative to models for the remainder of the plot.  This actually remains an issue with the graph I linked since the 1980-1999 baseline used features [more positive ENSO activity](https://psl.noaa.gov/enso/mei/img/meiv2.timeseries.png) than the latter half of the graphed period. Because of this we expect that even a 100% perfect model of climate forcing and response would produce a greater surface warming trend than observed on plots with these configurations.  The supposition of many of these graphs is that any divergence shown can be extrapolated into the future. But the thing is, if we [use a baseline further in the past](https://science2017.globalchange.gov/img/figure/figure3_1.png), which should magnify the divergence based on that logic, in fact the divergence disappears. That's because what's shown with more recent baselines is mostly a consequence of temporary natural variability rather than long-term forcing-response error.  2) Not updated. There are a number of these graphs around and they all stop at around 2015 (last five year average 2011-2015). There's a very specific reason for that - there has been a big uptick in temperatures since 2011-2015. They were created at a time when the whims of short-term natural variability appeared to be showing models and observations diverging. Because subsequent observations show them converging again the people creating these graphs never bothered to update them - the data doesn't fit their narrative.  3) As shown on my linked plot HadCRUT4 is a low outlier in terms of global temperature change estimates, and was selected by the people making these graphs for that reason."

For example, they claim the BoM won't explain their adjustments, when in fact there is a [whole mini-site](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/acorn-sat/) and technical report pdf explaining the methodology, plus they list all adjustments made [station-by-station](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/acorn-sat/stations/#/23090).  Then they claim raw data is being deleted, which is just an insane claim. The raw data is **required** in the methodology to produce final corrected results. Also many other scientific groups around the world use the raw data for their own analyses. There would be a lot of complaints going on if raw data were being deleted.  The meat of the post is that there have been site changes to stations, which is of course why homogenisation is done, so how does this support your argument? They claim that the BoM deny there have been site changes at certain stations but provide no source for that claim. It's quite likely that there have been station changes at sites which lack documentation and go undetected, but that's a very different matter from the BoM stating outright that there have been no changes.  Regarding the example station given - Gladstone Radar - this is not even included in the BoM ACORN-Sat dataset so it's not clear what the point is. The Berkeley Earth analysis shows there are several documented changes at that site and finds a couple of undocumented changes. The Berkeley adjustments for this station id substantially reduce historical warming relative to the raw data.  Another example they give is Cairns, which actually [is an ACORN-Sat station](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/acorn-sat/stations/#/31011). They claim that the BoM ""forgot"" about a station move in 1966, but the reality is that it simply wasn't documented if it happened. In fact both the BoM and [Berkeley](http://berkeleyearth.lbl.gov/stations/4959) detect and correct for an undocumented shift in 1969, which may be the change referenced here.  JoNova also suggest there was another undocumented change in 1983. And there may have been a change in siting at that time, but it doesn't seem to have made a large enough difference to recorded temperatures to be detected.  Thing is it's easy to go around looking at photos of station siting, and it's not completely useless, but they tell you little to nothing about the actual resulting effect on recorded temperature of a siting change. For that you need some form of statistical comparison with nearby stations."
