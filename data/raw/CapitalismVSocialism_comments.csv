Unknwon_To_All,2020-01-02 16:07:20,fcuhqfc,t3_eix2mh,t3_eix2mh,"Basically we distinguish between rent and profit. Rent is anything based on owning land (by the economic definition of anything that exists without been produced, so crude oil, water etc are counted as land). This is pure exploitation and a 100% land value tax is needed. These resources aren't produced so tue owners can't respond by producing less  Profit on the other hand is made threw capital which does have to be produced. There a lots of utilitarian justifications for this ranging from time preference to compensation for resource allocation to risk premiums.  So capitalism when defined as private ownership of capital is very much part of our system, we just don't like rent."

rpfeynman18,2020-01-02 17:42:27,fcurdla,t3_eix2mh,t3_eix2mh,"&gt; How do you feel about Socialists?  I feel that most socialist arguments I've encountered on this sub have the following logical structure:  1. The modern status quo isn't ""working"" for most people, by some definition of ""working"" (although clearly global poverty has fallen drastically...)  2. The modern status quo is capitalism.  3. Therefore the solution that will ""work"" for most people (again by that definition of ""work"") is socialism! (Of whatever variety -- communism, syndicalism, democratic socialism, Marxism, mutualism, libertarian socialism...)  Do you at least see how a person could in good faith disagree with all these three points?  Personally, I think socialists have a very different worldview. I am uncomfortable with the notion of exploitation of wage earners when there is mutual consent from both parties.  Of course socialists argue that the notion of ""consent"" is not very meaningful when the only other realistic option is to starve to death. But that doesn't matter to me. Consider the example of a man assaulted by a robber (and the robber has already run off with his misbegotten wealth), and that poor man now lies on the side of the street and needs to be taken to a hospital. If a passing lady chooses to help, that's good for her; she is rewarded with the satisfaction of helping another human in need. In a moral society a larger fraction of passers-by would make the choice to help. Regardless, if no one chooses to help and that man dies, I don't think any innocent passer-by should be punished. I would argue the ""fault"" lies entirely with the robber.  Now it is true that humans must eat to survive. But this state of affairs wasn't created by humans, it was created by Nature -- fruit does not rain from the sky. Nature plays the role of the robber from the previous paragraph, and all other humans play the role of the passer-by. The wage-earner's lack of skills that stops them from getting a better job isn't the fault of the employer, which is enough for me not to call it ""exploitation"". If a person starves, that is only possible if they can't be productive enough on their own to either grow their own food or earn their own living by generating productive value for other humans. I will feel sad if that happens, and might consider donating to charity to help them, but I don't see why that should be enforced.  &gt; How do you feel about Capitalists?  I generally find common ground much more often with capitalists. My biggest source of disagreement is that I often find them unwilling to examine their assumption of meritocracy more closely -- is it really true that the most qualified are the ones who, in general, rise to the top?  The problem is that the two biggest contributors to a deviation from meritocracy (in my opinion, of course) both require intervention that is problematic for most capitalists.  The first is that not all children have equal opportunity. Not all parents are equally rich, or equally attentive, or equally knowledgeable, or equally wise; and therefore some are going to be brought up better than others whether or not that is the fault of their parents. Clearly we can't solve this problem, but we should try to ameliorate it by increasing funding for schools, hiring more counselors and teachers and paying them better, mandating minimal criteria for education in math and science, and so on.  The second is that private property is backed by the violence of the state, and its moral justification needs to be examined. I have no problem with a person owning the fruits of their labor, but land and other natural resources are not the fruit of anyone's labor. The homesteading principle (""finders keepers"") is clearly completely arbitrary and can be decoupled very easily from capitalism -- I happen to think that all land should be owned in common but controlled by individuals to avoid a tragedy of the commons. The only solution is a 100% annual land rent paid as a tax. The advantage is that this tax is not only moral but economically efficient and does not require a large bureaucracy to implement."
LeFlamel,2020-01-02 18:38:13,fcux4n7,t3_eix2mh,t1_fcurdla,"Yours is the only good response to this thread, and has piqued my curiousity in geolibertarianism (am basically ancap, for lack of identifying anything better).  &gt;My biggest source of disagreement is that I often find them unwilling to examine their assumption of meritocracy more closely -- is it really true that the most qualified are the ones who are, in general, rise to the top?  Case in point, I do question this assumption a good bit. I think that the structure within a country's firms, in aggregate, has a large impact on the relative ""meritocracy"" that results. So I'm generally in favor of some sort of cooperative-style ancapistan culture, but don't think it should be enforced from on high by a government.  &gt;The first is that not all children have equal opportunity.  Similarly, while this can arguably negatively impact the ""meritocracy"" of an economy, government solutions to this are ultimately worse. I say arguably because there are many confounding variables when it comes to this issue. IQ and educational achievement has been shown to be fairly genetic (separated/adopted twin studies), and education is a socioeconomic signalling tool for employment discrimination due to the labor laws (at least in the US). It works because education is largely standardized. More varied competing educational systems would probably mitigate this issue as education should only matter with respect to what individuals can actually do. The model of educating children in batches by age is hilariously outdated and does a disservice to the less intelligent.  &gt;I happen to think that all land should be owned in common but controlled by individuals to avoid a tragedy of the commons. The only solution is a 100% annual land rent paid as a tax.  How this common ownership is handled and enforced could result in the establishment of a much larger government over time. So I guess the question I have is how does geolibertarianism respond to the critique ancaps have of minarchist's ""minimal state?"""
Jasko1111,2020-01-02 18:45:11,fcuxvs9,t3_eix2mh,t1_fcuhqfc,"In reality humans dont create matter, they just transform natural resources. When crude oil is extracted, it is transformed from natural state, and it is ""produced"" just as other products. Also when farmer transform virgin forest into farm, he is also producer, he transformed natural resource - land, and it should be in his private ownership."
Unknwon_To_All,2020-01-02 18:50:20,fcuyfga,t3_eix2mh,t1_fcuxvs9,"Yes the extraction of oil transforms it from land into a product and as such should no longer be under the tax, the same with the soil. The tax applies to the value of unimproved land, the value that the good has before any human effort is put into it.

Most of them have their heart in the right place...but not their brain. They perceive, correctly, that current economies are generally more unjust and unequal than is ideal. However, after that they go off the rails, diagnosing the problem as something to do with 'labor exploitation' and proposing a solution revolving around the abolition of private business and focusing on equality of outcome. There are straightforward psychological and cultural reasons why they come to these wrong conclusions, but those reasons don't make the conclusions any less wrong. The unfortunate circumstance we have now, though, is that there are many socialists reinforcing each other's wrong ideas and teaching each other to dogmatically ignore attempts to correct their mistakes.  &gt;How do you feel about Capitalists?  Geolibertarianism is a capitalistic economic philosophy. We don't want to end capitalism. In fact, we want to make it *better.* Capitalism works *best* when it is not tied down by the burden of private rentseeking."

marximillian,2020-01-03 00:28:44,fcvvydr,t3_ej6xlo,t3_ej6xlo,"&gt; So, in your preferred form of Socialism what would be the ""system"" that dictates how many restaurants a community gets and if they should stay open?   There wouldn't be ""a system"" (but likely numerous).  Workers would decide to build / maintain / staff restaurants, insofar as they wanted them or more of them (wanted them less cramped, shorter wait times for food, etc).  If they don't want them, or don't want more them, then they wouldn't.  Realistically, I don't think restaurants in their current form would be maintained.  What I think would be far more common is having collective spaces/kitchens which can be used for cooking/eating socially.  Whether that be you wanting to cook for yourself or you wanting to cook for others.  Ironically, I would think a lot more ""restaurants"" would actually be like ""chopped"" where people who want to flex their skills would organize to cook and compete for respect and recognition.  And insofar as something was repetitive, rather than being different restaurants in different locations, I'd think you'd see more variation in time... so you don't go to ""Big Phil's Fish Hut"" you go to the downtown dinner space, where every Friday Big Phil is flexing his seafood skills.  I also don't think they would be staffed in the same way, i.e. with dedicated waiters/waitresses/bussers/washers... rather it'd be much more similar like being at a friends dinner party, when you're done, you all figure out how you can help cleanup.  Of course, there will always still be the person who says, ""don't worry, I'll take care of it all, relax and enjoy."""
RandomCollection,2020-01-03 01:03:20,fcvz42l,t3_ej6xlo,t3_ej6xlo,"As I support a mixed economy, I would be open to the possibility of a market system deciding on the supply.   Groups of workers would get to petition for new restaurants. The number permitted would be based on:  1. Current restaurant traffic 2. Projects for future growth (or if declining due to population/traffic declines, no new restaurants will be required) 3. Projections of traffic based on consumer preferences   From there, the workers (now entrepreneurs) can choose how to fund their store.   1. &gt;50% state financing means this is a state owned enterprise partially owned by workers  2. &lt;50% means that this is a worker co-operative that, depending on if they elect to get state financing or not, partially owned by the state   It's likely that there will be more restaurant proposals than the market can sustain (and in capitalist societies, most close after their first year - https://yourbusiness.azcentral.com/average-life-span-restaurant-6024.html). So a number of factors would be considered to arrive at an actuarial probability for highest success.  1. The business acumen of the workers (this may include education, qualifications, skills such as their culinary skills, etc)  2. Location proposed 3. The ability of the restaurant to match future expected demand  (ex: do people in the area like the taste of food x)? 4. Past performance  of founders  (in their jobs) 5. Edit: I will also put that worker owned restaurant proposals where they line up their own funding will be looked upon more favourably as well, as they are using their own money   The system would permit 2x more restaurants than the market would sustain. This is on purpose. So statistically, around 50% will fail.  That's lower than the capitalist societies, but  it allows for some competition, and some experimentation.   The failures would be allowed to go back to looking for work (the state would have a reasonably generous welfare system) and maybe eventually for future ventures.  One big difference is that the state would have a bigger share of the profits (after all it did, except in the 100% worker owned enterprises, provide the necessary seed funding). Restaurants are historically not a high margin industry and most will not break even, so this is not as big as it seems.   Edit:   The other big difference of course is that in worker owned stores, the workers themselves get a share of the profit because they own their business.  New workers can be hired as shareholders and  can accumulate a share of the shares themselves based on:  - Their contributions (financially) - Number of hours worked - Performance of the worker  - Time served with the company  In summary, big differences are:  1. Workers get their share of the profits  (as opposed to the current system which is about making shareholders and executives rich, while screwing over anyone  else) 2. Where the state puts up money, the profits are socialized - when we for example, bail out the banking sector, the risks are socialized, but the profits are privatized. The same is true for publicly funded research.  3. The profits are used to fund a more generous welfare system for those that don't succeed. 4. The state may bail out failing restaurants, but in return, becomes a permanent shareholder (and will only privatize in the future if the workers share the profits amongst each other) 5. The state has the say in the number of stores based on existing evidence (although to be fair, many cities have their own regulations that do this already), but in this case, the state has more power"

In socialism, these people present a proposal asking for resources. The community expresses desire, insures demand, then provides the resources(that belong to everyone).

If you wanted how to open a restaurant, make that your question. But none the less, I will give you an answer for this new question. Largely, a good chunk of things would be fairly similar, still need to find equipment, a building ect. This would probably involve going through whatever system your community has for allocating those resources. Past that, socialism isn't necessarily the removal of ""markets"" more so who owns the means of production and who the fruits of labor is distributed. Demand is still a thing, so is supply, it's just attacked communally.  Now, we could take the view (and this is abridged from the ""conquest of bread"") that those that enjoy cooking should cook, and it be as simple as that. Granted if the restaurant becomes popular and many wish to cook there, a competition between cooks with the winner decided by the population they serve may be necessary to determine who works there.  Or we could take a different view, and just hold interviews, with those that wish to create the restaurant, for a position.  And again, socialism isn't the complete removal of every hierarchy (nor is anarchism for that matter, but I am already off topic enough) or the break down of the ""individual"". It's basically just making communal decisions on where the fruits of production go.  Now, granted again, to my knowledge no one gave a socialist road map to making a restaurant. I have read both Kropotkin and Lenin speak of pianos, but not restaurants. Nor am I deep in the restaurant business. So, this answer had a good bit of liberty on my part."

wizardnamehere,2020-01-03 10:07:11,fcx0qer,t3_ej925s,t1_fcww881,"&gt; Ohh I see. Maybe I do have obsession with innovation thank you for helping point out.    It's not just you. It's all of modern society. Improvement is by definition good, but the current zeitgeist often conflates innovation with improvement. Arguably, because of capitalism, society has a cultural obsession with newness, innovation, and entrepreneurs (but that is a different ideological discussion).   For instance. The internet is a groundbreaking innovation for the world, but it's hardly all improvement across the board. The internet's legacy is complicated, disputed, and often harmful. Another example; It may eventually turn out that the invention of the steam engine was the worst thing to happen to civilization.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt; What about learning and research loom large for you? Thank you for replying!   Well i suppose i see education and learning as something liberating for the individual. In understanding the world, in tools for how to think, and in context. So education and learning is something which should be very well resourced and not just limited to a period in school, but rather something which is a bit conceptualized as a continuous process over one's whole life. Free schools, free university, free classes in various institutions, free libraries, a generally accessible and well resourced public education sector beyond just public schools.   As for research and the academy. Well i see the university as very very successful institution which should be iterated on and made more public; as in university education should be more widely available and there should be more of them. Universities should continue to be independent and focused on their core purpose; understanding the universe and teaching people to understand.   A lot of resources should continue (if not be increased) to be directed towards pure research. The government should work with the university to act a funding source and bridge between academia and industry; to help people to create new cooperatives for newly thought up processes and bring new processes to existing cooperatives. As well universities and the government would work together in shoring up ailing sectors in the economy or building new ones as necessary for the national and community interest (like say building a new renewable energy sector)."

A lot of science is done through our centralized system, we pay taxes and the govt uses those taxes for research. Companies can also fund research, but only massive companies seem to be very interested in it.  So I think science as it is takes a hit from libertarian-ism, but I think a new sort of science will emerge. Science is the discovery of the world around us, to manipulate it for our benefit. This is innately human and is seriously hard to stop. Only an oppressive church has managed to do it so far and science still remained active underground.  So I'm expecting less research into things like space travel, instead of us all paying taxes which are fed into NASA, we'd only have people like Elon Musk who researches from donations and profit. I'm expecting more research into things like how to generate green power at home. Under libertarian-ism, you don't care too much about the people at the other side of the country, because you have no power over them. You only have power over your home, so people will create science to improve their home. We'd stop building massive wind farms in the ocean, but everyone would have their own little wind turbine in their backyard supplying just them. That will become the new focus of science. I think."
Unknwon_To_All,2020-01-03 10:27:03,fcx1n7h,t3_ej6xlo,t1_fcvz42l,"For fully worker funded why stop at twice as much? If the state isn't losing any funding why not just let them go for it, more competition and more exploitation, don't forget if you have worker owned ones you still need competition to keep prices down (or whatever you charge if you want to replace money) as workers can be just as rent seeking as capitalists charging high prices, it's just now the profits go to the workers but it still comes with the deadweight loss associated with monopoly.  I'm also curious as to what happens when workers leave and new ones take their place, who still owns a share? The old worker paid some initial investment to get the idea off the ground and the new worker didn't so if they came in and got a share of the company, wouldn't that be unfair to those that actually had to pay to start the restaurant, not the mention the disincentive to invest if you can just start at another business and get part ownership without paying the startup cost."

masterflappie,2020-01-03 10:43:51,fcx2fej,t3_ejdgrt,t1_fcx1kz0,"&gt;So I can knowingly sell you poisoned meat and if you get grievously sick or die it’s “buyer beware”?  Yes. I know it sounds dangerous, but it's just not like people to do any of these things. Imagine you're a butcher, you're going to be fucking terrified that any of the meat you sell turns out to be poisonous. If word ever comes out that your meat is bad, you might as well just sell your store and go look for a new job. The amount of stress and risk that brings with it is plenty of deterrence. Even if you really hate someone, you'd opt for chugging a beer and just punching him in the face, not poisoning him.  Moreover, people are very afraid of this problem, it's what kept me from supporting it before. The thing is, even if it's illegal, we're still equally afraid of the problem. Even though it's illegal to sell someone poisonous meat, we still heavily rely on quality marks and regular sanitary checks. These wouldn't disappear, they would become much more important. You could look at all the different quality mark, pick one you trust enough and buy food only with that mark.  So I think the problems will turn out to be a lot smaller than expected, but there are upsides to it too. Meat is rather expensive, but pretty healthy. Same goes for vegetables really. If you look at poor people now, where do they eat? McDonalds, KFC, just fast food restaurants in general really. Fast food is really cheap so if you're poor that's a good option. If we remove all of our obligatory quality checks, permits etc, we could have a much wider range of food options. Poor people could opt to start buying some questionable meat or vegetables over fast food, which I think will end up actually being healthier for them. Also, more people can just start selling food without having to get a permit, so food will be much more abundant, therefore cheaper, again helping the poor people who need the most help. Even you could just grow some tomatoes in your backyard and sell it on the side.   &gt;I’m for decriminalization of most drugs but I don’t like the idea being able to buy meth at the corner drug store. I feel that will just increase the number of wards of the state.  Portugal and Switzerland once took a completely different method of helping their drug problems. They started off prohibiting it and training police to combat drugs. They pretty quickly found out that that's very expensive, it doesn't reduce the amount of addicts and it creates a lot of crime.  So instead they created institutions where addicts could get their shot for free. They were allowed to use as much as they could handle based on their body weight. It was administered by a doctor and they could only leave once their high wore off.   What happened is that the addicts immediately lost a fuck ton of stress. They didn't have to worry about making money to fuel their addiction. Illegal drug sellers went out of business straight away and had to find a normal job. Crime went way down, but more importantly the addicts started getting their life in order. Now that they had such a reduction in stress and an increase in time, they started educating themselves, they started making friends and forming romantic relationships. As they got their life back in order again, they relied on their drugs less and less and eventually stopped going to the clinics. So giving drugs away for free actually helped and reduced the amount addicts unlike the police force. Best of it all? Hiring the doctors and producing/buying the drugs was actually about twice as cheap as training a police force to combat drug use.  Drugs aren't the problem, people living horrible lives is the problem. So you don't combat drugs, you help people get their life in order."

Looking at the dangerous Chinese products were the venders go to great lengths to counterfeit brand markings and the like.  I expect if we were to deregulate today we would see independent firms rise up to ensure quality control.   For example the American Bureau of Shipping is a organization that works with both the US Coast Guard and marine insurers.  They don’t have any regulatory power but their stamp of approval is respected by both parties.    Your point about the drug issue is interesting.  I admit I’m not too familiar with how Portugal handled their drug issues past their decriminalization.  Are you ok with taxpayer money going directly to the purchase and use of hard narcotics?  I feel like although it might make sense it would be an impossible sell in the US where it’s hard to even have a needle exchange programs.  I will look into it more.

Achieving this would be hard though, the US will only give up their nukes if Russia does the same and vice versa.

The only downside is that the free market is a bit sluggish and slow, while a government can change how things are run over night. So I see some value in having a central authority ""smoothing"" things along, but it should be done in a way that won't allow the central authority to hurt the free market too much. I don't know what ""too much"" would be though, so I have no idea how you can fit a central authority neatly into this picture, so I'd rather live without central authority. Plus, like with the quality marks, people who do value such a service can simply create their own central authority and join or leave it as they please.

The answer will be different depending on the situation you are talking about.   In the Bezos example, I don't think anyone would say it's okay.

But she also had friends who will now miss her. Are they entitled to compensation? I think most people would say no. Many harms in life just have to be absorbed.

Are you talking about having different court systems.  The Bezo thing was a very poorly thought and worded hyperbolic example that I will be edited soon.  Basically  should anyone be above the law if they have means to buy off anyone.  Weapons manufacture is highly regulated in the amount that can be produced and to whom the company can sell.  Governments in theory can be held accountable if they use their weapons improperly.  Knowingly making and selling a weapon of mass destruction to a private citizen is incredibly irresponsible.

Pharmaceutics is something I guess we can agree on are in everyone's best interest to keep furthering our knowledge in, and keep improving on. Yet what we see a lot today is that big companies keep out cheaper alternatives in favour of their own more expensive products. You can argue it's in the shareholders best interest, but it isn't for the general populace.  An other example would be oil companies that sweep research under the rug in the 80's to keep the general populace from knowing that their fuel consumption has a global impact. Again you can argue that it's in the interest of shareholders and even the people using fuel. But again it's shown to have negative impact on a larger scale.  Those aren't enormous 'we die now if we don't do anything' problems as you described, but both are more of the long term lingering type with a big impact for future generations.

You can argue it's in the shareholders best interest, but it isn't for the general populace.  This happens in some cases, often the large companies buy smaller innovators *which many smaller innovative companies have included in their business plans/strategies.      But the best argument, imo, is one based upon individual rights, the state shouldn't intervene in markets and infringe upon the right of association- state licensing infringes upon the right of association, state regulations infringe upon the right of association, etc.     So it doesn't require a metric be created from a measure of a society, just the application of rights deduced from self-ownership.        &gt;that sweep research under the rug in the 80's to keep the general populace from knowing that their fuel consumption has a global impact.        This is far more complex than that. Oil companies provide goods/services to people do demand them. Some companies acted in ways to limit nuclear energy development, other oil companies sought to expand nuclear development. Other parties, like Greenpeace worked to stop all nuclear energy development.      State regulations, some reasonable some created to help special interests- Greenpeace, et al, Fossil fuel companies, slowed and in most cases stopped investment in nuclear energy research innovation.      This problem this created is that modular nuclear technology innovation were stalled or never started. Modular means a huge reduction in regulatory compliance costs- the nuclear too expensive argument.       &gt;But again it's shown to have negative impact on a larger scale.     As I outlined above, there wasn't one bad actor involved. Also, we don't have a clear cost/benefit analysis to argue what path is/would have been best overall.       Would a Manhattan project for non-fossil fuel energy in the 80s have created more benefits or costs?        &gt;So I'm curious to hear what other systems or even capitalism (in a slightly different form) offer so I can put them through the same thought experiment.     All other 'systems' assert a right and ability to intervening in markets and individual/group contractual agreements that will result in positive outcomes. These are just assertions, and no advocates ever agree to any personal liability for their experiments. With the mild respect for property in mixed economies there is liability for all actors. First their own resources are risked, second there is some possibility of civil damages (the state intervenes in these processes as well).      What liability do socialists have? Statists of all stripes? So far I've seen exactly zero."

Iran is held together by the myth of Persia and anti Arab sentiment - the government isn’t too popular and there is an attitudinal shift in the population that is strengthening as the youth become more political. How they react to this will be important to Iran maintaining the current ruling class.

He says he is 120 pounds, so he is probably correct not to go out and fight the fires personally. He could do something, but he is looking out for his own affairs first. This is normal.  It's the same with most of the brave talk from Marxists about everyone pulling together to help others and not for the money. But really, we are primarily motivated by self-interest with a dash of concern for others. Trying to run an entire economy where people are motivated to give to the community isn't ever going to work. We are just not good enough for a system like that to work."

He had to because Communism won't work otherwise. You can't get people to work if you remove the profit motive. So he fooled himself that people would just work because they wanted to. Truly one of the dumbest notions ever.    From Critique of the Gotha Programme  &gt; In a higher phase of communist society, after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labor, and therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labor, has vanished; **after labor has become not only a means of life but life's prime want**; after the productive forces have also increased with the all-around development of the individual, and all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly – only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banners: **From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!**  The truth is, most people would rather not do most jobs. And it will never be anyone's prime want in life to clean other people's toilets, but it's an important job that has to be done. The capitalist answer is that you pay them to do it. But if everyone gets according to their needs regardless of what work they do, they will do as little as possible. Because, as you correctly implied above, people aren't perfect little angels willing to sacrifice themselves for the collective. I'm going to guess that's true in 'stralia too.  ---  Off topic: Just how bad is it where you are? The pictures look very bad.

The US has plenty of well trained soldiers to sustain a years long conflict without instituting a draft or taking over some part of the economy for military production.  2. While Iran has given out threats of retaliation, it is likely that this will not lead to a large scale war/invasion of Iran. Iran already has large investments of ""militia"" forces in several Arab countries.  3. While we can't rule out the possibility of an invasion, we can rule out the possibility of a short war with Iran. This will instead be a much longer, bloody war. While bombs will undoubtedly level the cities, you can't bomb Iranian militants living in caves in the many mountains of the region. And you can't just make them surrender when they still have over 3 quarters of their forces ready to fight.  EDIT: Also to the troll that is here talking about a civil war, I'd like to ask whether or not you or these supposed neighbors of yours have ever been visited by the NSA, CIA, or FBI.

I said no, it is not, it is an assassination?  Don't get so easily triggered.  &gt; No I don't think there's any plan at all to assassinate the Iranian leadership period.  I didn't think so.

It seems to mean that the US is going to engage in something outside of the asymmetrical warfare I mentioned in my initial post, but your more recent post seems to be scaling that back.

Looks like it worked.  So, like, there is no dispute over what the US just did, so no need to reiterate the known accepted facts.  What I'm asking is what you believe will happen next. I stated ""It will happen, but it won't be a war like ww 2. It will be an escalation of proxies, economic sabatogue, Iran exploiting their position in the gulf, attacks on KSA oil infrastructure, assassinations, kidnappings, etc, etc.""  You seemed to take issue with this, but I'm having difficulty seeing what you disagree with.  Or are you saying that 3000 troops in Kuwait will be able to prevent Iranian asymmetrical retaliation throughout the region and beyond?  Because this seems silly.

Edit: IIRC after WWII and until the first Gulf War, large conventional forces were considered unbeatable and was Soviet and Chinese military doctrine through the Cold War. The US could never field a massive military and sought instead to achieve technological and air superiority in any conflict. Until the first Gulf War, no one knew if US doctrine would work against a large, experienced, and well trained conventional military. The absolute easy at which the US conquered Iraq twice woke up the rest of the world. That is why China has heavily focussed technological spending and staying out of assymetric warfare."

A win is a win.  Hell, this is exactly what I said in my first post is that modern wars are asymmetrical, and Iran is hella good at that.  But I doubt even conventionally US would have an easy time. Where would they stage from? The US would suck balls in a shallow water like the persian gulf, and Iran has small boats that would easily control the waterway. On the ground, Iran has enough proxies that the US could barely set up their missiles to stage an attack, and they couldn't land.   The US would be best at air strikes, but they would be lengthy, and costly. And even if infrastructure was destroyed, without troops on the ground, any successes here would be temporary.  https://www.militarytimes.com/news/2019/06/04/what-war-with-iran-could-look-like/  US victory, if it would come at all, would be more extensive than anything we've seen before.

Rather than risk American lives, your American friends are creating conflict in Iran for two enemies - ISIS and the Iranian military. So while those two take eachother out, we'll just take out their leaders. We got the General. ISIS think tank was dog food (He's a good boy!) And the supreme leader of Iran will be next. And soon, Iran will be the second Democracy to ever exist in the middle east (can you imagine Iran and Israel becoming allies?!) I wonder what that would mean. Peace in the Middle East?

Radical extremists are people too, they deserve energy monopolies to arm powerful militias and get their hands on WMD's. Everyone has the right to possess the means of nuclear capability.

koany2012,2020-01-04 01:14:29,fczg2od,t3_eji9h4,t1_fcz9yu8,"I guess there are a few problems there.  Firstly, due to corruption and graft, US military technology has fallen on the wayside since then. There is probably still an edge on most countries (who knows, agst China) but belligerents have studied weaknesses and tech has not greatly improved since the nineties. The f-35, for instance, is a perfect example of a bunch of money going to weapons contractors in return for jack squat.  Secondly, they haven't really ""conquered"" Iraq twice. The insurgency in Iraq and ISIS is largely a result of debaathification. That part of the war still isn't over.  Thirdly, I question your premise. The nuclear deterrent was long considered much more important than conventional army size. This technological and air superiority had been the preoccupation.   Fourthly, Iraq didn't surprise or wake up the world from anything. Since the the nuclear armed USSR the world had been bipolar, and since the collapse, unipolar due primarily to technological superiority. The thing that woke up the world was a series of asymmetrical forms of warfare culminating in 9/11. This is the type of warfare of the future, because the risks and costs of conventional warfare are too high. Iran excels at this type of warfare. A conventional attack on Iran even with technological superiority, would result in a number of swift attacks around the world taking various forms. It is likely we will see these even in the upcoming weeks, although Iran may or may not claim culpability.   China has various reasons for focusing on the technology ""rather than"" asymmetrical warfare (although I'd argue their mercantilist policies and cyber warfare is extensive and fits the bill here.) Primarily, they have no real incentive to put their blood and treasure at risk in imperial ventures. To the extent that they do involve themselves in foreign affairs, it is through economic investment. The US is lashing out, while China is making smart, long term alliances and engaging in economic imperialism."

If anything, it is a lot more transparent than say, getting money from a bank or a VC firm. One fun factor, since a socialist society is less unequal, it is less likely to be  corrupt. (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0313592617302278)  &gt;Using a dynamic GMM model, we robustly find that income inequality positively affects corruption, while corruption does not appear to be significant in the determination of income inequality, therefore contradicting the existing empirical literature on this topic.  As far as financial accountability, the books of that company are likely to be public if they are an SOE. As far as a private worker owned co-op, again, they do need to report on taxation.  &gt;Would the committee be better or worse than today’s investors at identifying risks and opportunities? Would you be concerned about the committee gambling other peoples’ (taxpayer) money?  That's hard to say. It would be more transparent.   Factors negatively affecting it:  - Not as strong a profit motive  - Not as severe a consequence for failing due to generous welfare state  Factors positively affecting it:   - More transparency compared to capitalism  - More likely to be independent (ex: independent of social or family networks)  and value expertise  over luck (ex: born to a rich family and inherited wealth)  &gt; If the only way to get outside funding is through the government committee, would you be concerned about a lack of competition at the funding level?   Private citizens can always pool their money together for a worker's co-op if they wished to do so.  &gt; I.e., wouldn’t you lose out on an ecosystem of investors with different strategies, ideas, and areas of expertise, who are themselves competing to fund the best opportunities? Are you concerned at all about a loss of innovation, given that every business would have to clear this singular bottleneck before even getting the chance to prove itself in the market?  I'm not as worried about this as most capitalists might think.   Quite a few startups in places like Silicon Valley are no longer about making big ideas and more about getting acquired by Google, Facebook, etc.   Similarly, in the restaurant business, there might not be a big loss as you might fear. There is one other consideration - with the state having so much input, there is also the matter of what the public wants.   Many restaurants tend to  focus on stock buybacks and dividends these days over capital investment.   https://aaronallen.com/blog/stock-buybacks-dividend-distributions  I actually think that state owned companies have the option of spending a higher percentage of revenue on R&amp;D, capital  spending, etc, simply because they are freed for short term profits.   1. Does the public prefer taking risks and higher failure rates? 2. Or is the public more risk averse?  So in that regard, public appetite for risk might be a driver.  &gt;If the planned number of restaurants is higher than the number of people who are looking to start one (say, for a bad location), will the government force someone to open that restaurant?  Only if there was very high demand for restaurants.  If more people are spending money on restaurants and they were overflowing, then there would be more proposals approved.   If that was not sufficient, then perhaps increasing funding and compensation (within limits, as a socialist society would want a low level of inequality). However, ""force"" is not likely to be applied (by ""force"", I would imagine you would be referring to the civilian equal to military conscription).  People ""forced"" to go are unlikely to do a good job.    &gt;Conversely, if the planned restaurant slots are filled up but lots of people still want to start them because they see opportunity in the industry, isn’t that a sign that the public values restaurants more than the government thinks, and the public would be better off having those restaurants?  There's a simple way to tell. By the bankruptcy rate.   If the bankruptcy rate of stores is low, then demand for restaurants is not satiated. If there are very high bankruptcies, then approvals will be halted (maybe only a very small number for truly exceptional performers or where they are 100% worker owned and funded co-ops), until a more reasonable rate.    ----  Effectively this is a mixed, but certainly socialist or very left wing social democratic economy. It is intended to combined socialism with supply and demand where practical."

The goal is to have a balance between to few stores resulting in monopolies (but if that happened, then a socialist society would have steeply progressive taxes anyways that would keep a lid on inequality), versus having a very high failure rate (to avoid overtaxing the welfare state).   &gt;I'm also curious as to what happens when workers leave and new ones take their place, who still owns a share? The old worker paid some initial investment to get the idea off the ground and the new worker didn't so if they came in and got a share of the company, wouldn't that be unfair to those that actually had to pay to start the restaurant, not the mention the disincentive to invest if you can just start at another business and get part ownership without paying the startup cost.  For owners, I would give them the ability to negotiate the terms, subject to a ""maximum allowable inequality per hour worked"" and ""per unit of currency invested"". So that is up to workers. But keep in mind with a very high marginal tax rate, even if they got a huge share .... the money largely goes back to the state.

Belt and Road initiative.  &gt; They lay claim to a vast area of ocean they have no rights on by international law.  No world power follows international law to a T. Regardless, they are not under threat by any of the nations in the South China Sea. They are the economic powerhouse in that region, and frankly, and world power in their position would assert dominance over the area.  With regards to my overall point, none of those countries are going to fight China over it.  &gt; They have been proven to steal patented technology multiple times (Huawei is build on stolen technology).  And?  &gt; The US is not perfect, sure. But stop pretending like China is so much better because you dislike the US?  I literally just accused them of economic imperialism.  &gt; Also in what world is the US not by far the most advanced and feared military?   Did I assert this?  &gt; Look I’m not from the US and even I have no problem admitting that in a vacuum the US is probably as powerful as the next three nations combined.  Get back to me once wars start getting fought inside of vaccums.  &gt; Invading Iran is no easy feat. I’ll admit that. It’s not like Iran has some mega advanced military rivalling the US tho.  No. It has geography and a military (Navy) optimized for its situation, along with a vast network of proxies and agents and enough missile deterrence to make an invasion a VERY. STUPID.

Or had, I dunno, an entire branch of our military dedicated to quick response amphibious warfare.  &gt; The US has nothing for shallow water warfare  We build corvettes and frigates too, you fucking idiot. Also, littoral combat ships are made *specifically* for this role.  &gt; (and arguably nothing but useless targets for ocean warfare)  Even if you assume that anything that isn't a sub is useless (which is fucking dumb, but whatever), we've also got the biggest submarine fleet. We've got two dozen more subs than Russia, and while China's close in numbers, theirs aren't nearly as advanced (fewer than ten nuclear subs, and a few of them are from the 1950s). But whatever, you're a stupid piece of shit."

Much like taking Pierre Spreyy’s opinion on the F-35 is memetic.  How flawed is it? Computer placed the USN within range of unnamed middle eastern nation’s shores (read: Iran) so it wouldn’t interfere with nearby commerce (Strait of Hormuz). Communications by (Iran) were delivered through motorcycle couriers which the computer treated as equally efficient as actual radio communications. The USN was defeated by modified civilian craft that carried missiles (P-15s) larger and heavier than the craft itself, hope I don’t have to explain how this wouldn’t work in real life.  Granted, a US victory was then scripted into the experiment. However, Millennium Challenge 2002 has been largely debunked.

No this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the means of production in Marxist terms, it’s generally a bad idea to deduce the meaning of a term by the definition of its words.   The means of production refers to that which the labourer “interposes” between themselves (tools), and the raw material which they work up into a product using that tool - my labour is not a means of production; labour stands as a homogenous physical activity, which only with access to the means of production can make anything useful.   &gt; you can even be a social media influencer now ffs  I could, I could, I could even perhaps grow wings if I tried hard enough!

No rich guy is pulling a lever or grinding an engine block and poor people get paid a fraction of the hourly income that that service ultimately earns in the market. So the hour is worth $150 on the market and the employee gets $14 of that, maybe $30 total after taxes and other overhead, less if it’s outsourced to Thailand where they pay 30cents an hour. The rich guy doesn’t pay any taxes or a tiny fraction compared to a wage earner so the poor guy (or debt paid back by the poor guys kids) pays for the roads and military and the FCC and the infrastructure that allows for a stable market environment. Who is subsidizing who?   Universal health care isn’t asking for a free lunch. No one can eat and pay rent with insurance. It just means all you have won’t be taken from you by the hospital if you get sick."

Every attack from either side has been justified as a response to something previous that the other side did....except for the 1953 American Coup in Iran. We installed a puppet dictator in 1953 (the Shah) and then Iran took American hostages during the Iranian Revolution in the late 70's. And the hostilities have just gone back and forth ever since. Each side using the most recent transgression as justification for their actions. We are over in THEIR territory, they are not over here in ours. I believe the U.S. government should stop trying to be the overlords of these middle-eastern states.   We also didn't pay them 200 billion dollars. These were Iranian assets from the 70's and 80's that the US FROZE through sanctions. It was theirs to begin with, we just didn't allow them to return it to their own country. It's not like we paid them a bribe, we simply gave them their money back.  ""The $400 million was Iran's to start with, placed into a US-based trust fund to support American military equipment purchases in the 1970s. When the Shah was ousted by a 1979 popular uprising that led to the creation of the Islamic Republic, the US froze the trust fund. Iran has been fighting for a return of the funds through international courts since 1981.  In announcing the agreement, Obama said that paying the $400 million -- plus $1.3 billion in interest -- was saving American taxpayers billions of dollars. The Iranians had been seeking more than $10 billion at arbitration.  ""For the United States, this settlement saved us billions of dollars that could have been pursued by Iran,"" Obama said in January. ""There was no benefit to the United States in dragging this out.""  As it was making the January cash delivery, the US also imposed new sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missile testing. At the same time, the White House unfroze a larger pool of Iranian assets, estimated at $100 to $150 billion, as part of the nuclear deal, though administration officials cautioned that Iran would only pocket about $50 billion after legal claims.""  Also, you'll be able to find videos back to 1996 where Netanyahu (prime minister of Israel) was saying on the congressional floor that Iran was only 1 year away from getting nukes. Then a few years later, the same claim is made. Then a few years later, the same thing. All the while, the Iranians are constantly denying the charge that they are even attempting to make nukes. They are trying to create nuclear power plants to try to ween off of the importance of oil. Now, it's extremely difficult to discern who is telling the truth...but it gets hard to trust the accusers when they've been making the exact same accusation for 30 years and being wrong about it every single time."

Homogenised_Milk,2020-01-04 22:28:18,fd5esrs,t3_ek1iw8,t3_ek1iw8,"1. US aggression against Iran goes back to 1953 when the democratically elected government overthrown by the CIA and others to install a monarch, but you said a few things that are just wrong or don't make any sense. 2. Plenty of countries, e.g. the US, Saudi Arabia, are interested in 'dominating the region', 'interfering', supporting violence etc. I'm not sure what you mean by 'pushing at the Saudi borders' because they don't share a border. The idea, I thought, is that you're meant to keep it 'proxy', not just directly bomb government officials. 3. Iran didn't get paid. That was them getting their money back when sanctions were lifted. 4. According to the relevant observers they did stop. They declared they would no longer comply with some parts of the deal a year after the US completely left the deal and reinstated sanctions. 5. You probably can compare it to the US. Just grab a few clips from Fox News or something about turning the Middle East into glass or something and talk about the wars the US has been involved in, the people they've armed and the regimes they've supported.   Let's say, hypothetically of course, the government of a country called East Timor learned that the US was planning to support the invasion of their country by a neighbour politically, militarily and economically - an invasion for the express purpose of conquering territory, and one that would result in over a hundred thousand people dying.

So there is no way you get that large of a bill for a heart attack or cancer unless you went out-of-network or \*chose\* to get cancer treatment that was not covered. If cancer treatment wasn't covered, then you can change insurances. ACA made it illegal to deny health insurance coverage due to a pre-existing condition.

Besides, if on the off chance that you do happen to go out of network due to a heart attack on vacation or something and rack up such a hefty bill, call the hospital and they will likely settle with you for a small fraction (single digit percentage) of what you owe.

End-Da-Fed,2020-01-05 05:26:37,fd7bktl,t3_ek1iw8,t3_ek1iw8,"The recent killing of the rapist, genocidal, terrorist and Iranian major general Qasem Soleimani has sparked numerous political debates in my social circles. The two biggest debate topics that keep coming up are:  1. Who initially started the conflict? Iran or the USA? 2. Was Trump's decision to kill Qasem Soleimani a retaliatory strike or an unjustified preemptive action?  This forced most of my friends, relatives, and colleagues to do a bit of research. Once we all dug into the history they were surprised to discover the following:  TD;LR - Iran has always had political stability issues. The weaker political faction in the 1950s was the Persian King, a.k.a. the shah (Reza Shah Pahlavi) , so he solicited the aid of the British and American government to re-establish political power. He was unsuccessful in keeping power long-term and the royal dynasty was destroyed in 1979. Presently Iran is run by racist, xenophobic, Islamists still very bitter towards the USA and Britain meddling with their attempt to usurp the Persian king's political authority back in the 1950s.  &amp;#x200B;  The history is as follows:  1. The question of ""who started it"" traces back to Mohammad Mosaddegh, the son of an Iranian public official who's family was as a member of Iran’s ruling elite. 2. Mosaddegh was highly educated across Europe and eventually was appointed by the shah (King of Persia),  Ahmad Shah Qajar, as the Prime Minister of Iran. 3. Mosaddegh immediately infuriated the royal crown (the Shah) by gaining more political power and popularity than the king himself and worked tirelessly to disrespect and undermine the king's authority. For example: Mosaddegh took it upon himself to appoint a Minister of War and the Chief of Staff, something only the shah had done up to that point. 4. Part of why Mosaddegh's power and influence were so great, he founded National Front, a miniature army of thugs, propagandists, and scholars to be used at his disposal. National front used dramatic propaganda to promote a broad spectrum of political factions including civic nationalists, liberal-democratic activists, socialists, secularists, bazaari, and Islamic scholarship. 5. Iran was a backward country in desperate need of industrialization and foreign companies started trying to build refineries when oil was discovered there. The first major deal was provided by the Qajar Shahs to the British Anglo-Iranian Oil Company which was given legal oil concessions in the south of Iran so long as they put up the money to build infrastructure and refineries in the country, and used their influence to export oil quickly into international markets. 6. Mosaddegh used his power to block the Soviets from getting an identical legal oil concession in the north of Iran then pushed to not only reverse the oil concession agreement the Qajar Shahs made with the British government and the British oil company but to nationalize all the hard work the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and forcibly take more of the profits from oil sales. 7. The move was incredibly stupid since Mosaddegh used the government to steal investments from foreigners of whom he viewed with xenophobic zeal. His National Front Party continued to gain power but then alienated the liberal democratic supporters, the secularists, and further pushed out the Shah. The British soon withdrew completely from the Iranian oil market, and the British government imposed trade sanctions for the blatant legal corruption and theft. 8. Economic problems increased when Mosaddegh could not readily find alternate oil markets since no business could trust the defacto rulers of Iran, the members of National Front, to honor any contracts. 9. In August 1953, when the shah attempted to dismiss the Mosaddegh from office, mobs of Mosaddegh's National front took to the streets, killed people, forced bazaars to close, called for assassinating the shah, and other general social unrest. 10. This forced Reza Shah Pahlavi to leave the country but then solicit help from the British government and the USA to provide and orchestrate funding, counter-propaganda campaigns, proxy ""protestors"" (a.k.a. bussed in thugs) to overthrow the Mosaddegh regime and restore power back to the shah. 11. The National Front was outlawed and its highest-ranking leaders arrested and brought before a military court, while Mosaddegh was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment for treason and, after he had served his sentence, was kept under house arrest for the rest of his life. 12. Reza Shah Pahlavi's legacy remains controversial to this day because all of the people that tried to usurp his authority decry him as authoritarian while his supporters revere him as a strong leader seeking to re-establish law and order. 13. Another revolutionary coup in 1979 permanently usurped the Shah Pahlavi family dynasty and eventually installed the racist, civic nationalist, religious extremist, Sayyid Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini as the supreme leader of Iran.  Another takeaway here is this was yet another example that nationalization simply doesn't work in the modern era."

I could continue with these but the bottom line is more people are going to die so a small group of people can make money. 1.8 million civilians killed in the Iraq war by US estimates.

Okay, that's a statement, but do you have any sources to corroborate this claim, to begin with, is climate change not becoming irredeemably worse because of us, for example? Those political elites that you're talking about, are merely *saving* Capitalism. The Government should taking action against private industries. Companies have every incentive and even an obligation to their shareholders to maximize profits. That’s what they *do*, and those who willingly take on the cost of reducing emissions still has to compete with companies who don’t.     Here's a tough fact for you. There’s no getting around the reality that the incentive structure of private industry rewards polluting because it gives you an edge. To successfully argue that government should not have any role requires arguing that some other external motivation will do a better job of filling the role of a government. There’s lots of room to debate *how* the government goes about incentivizing companies to reduce emissions, but it won’t happen on its own, that's why we have people like Greta Thunberg (LOL) to help us with that endeavor.     \&gt; There’s no real solution.      I think if people were made more aware of the cost of their consumerism, they might police their consumer choices better. For instance, the consumer doesn’t really know that their clothes are cheap *because* they were made in a sweat shop. A consumer doesn’t know that beef is cheap *because* the agriculture industry can pollute without much consequence. They just see a cheap product, and so they buy it. I have no idea how you would actually make consumers more explicitly aware of these things, but I think it would help. It just seems that a huge reason for pollution is that consumers don’t comprehend the consequences of their choices. If they did, that might create an economic incentive for another company to produce goods more ethically.     \&gt; Your tax money wasted on climate change will solve nothing and make some well connected elites and supranationals wealthier.

I'm talking about islamic extremism (Which is now 2/3rds of the SÄPO(secret police) reported extremists), decreased social altruism and trust, the increased social inequality and wage losses, and the cost of integrating and educating immigrants.  It's no secret that crime has taken an upwards hike in many areas of europe - although in the case of Sweden I would attribute it mainly to the preexisting housing crisis *before* immigration and the resultant segregation of immigrants into isolated areas with extremely low 'native' populations, as well as the concurrent dismantlement of the welfare state.  &gt;They're liberals. You people have higher tax rates now with the regime change, no? But only the richer share of the population will be subject to this tax raise, I believe.  No, the Social Democrats, Left Party and Environment Party have aligned with the culture-left economic-right Centrist and Liberal factions - Tax pressure has been on a steady downward slope since the 1990s economic crisis.  The weird part is that we had the 2019 budget decided by the Right-wing, which the Centrist-Social Democrat coalition blame for social-economic problems while they decrease taxes *even further*.  They're overall decreasing tax pressure *in particular* on the richer populations.  &gt;You have to understand, however, that immigration has never been a net negative in terms of economics.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_Sweden#Public_finances  There are plenty of citations and this has been up in Swedish media on and off since the mid-2010s.  &gt;The impact of immigration is however not limited to the migration section in the budget. First generation immigrants, for example, constituted 60% of economic welfare recipients in 2016, 73% of all unemployed and 53% of those serving long prison sentences.  A significant body of intellectual work suggests that costs of immigration are as high as 1% of GDP - you have to consider that our immigration has been &gt;70 000/year since the early 2010s.  Between 2000 and 2015 our population increased from 8,8 to 9,8 million, out of which 0,6 million were foreign-born, the doubling of people with two foreign-born parents from 0,28 to 0,5 million, and the amount of granted citizenships often being below half of the immigration.  &gt;What's the Soviet usage of 'fascist'? I am asking because you have no clue what you're talking about.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascist_(insult)  &gt;After the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, ""fascist"" was used in the Soviet Union to describe virtually any anti-Soviet activity or opinion. According to Marxism–Leninism, fascism was the ""final phase of crisis of bourgeoisie"", which ""in fascism sought refuge"" from ""inherent contradictions of capitalism"". As a result of this approach, it was almost every Western capitalist country that was ""fascist"", with the Third Reich being just the ""most reactionary"" one.  The USA is Fascist, the liberalconservatives are Fascists, everyone that doesn't agree with the Left is a Fascist."

The market is highly unsuited for these type of things. Serious switching to renewable energy requires long-term planning, whereas the private market operates on short term profits. All the clean energy solutions that we already have in the market (electric cars, solar panels, etc.) appeared because of heavy subsidies made by the state. It's not a coincidence that China is leading the fight against climate change while the countries with the most unregulated markets have a horrible record (like the US).  &gt;We cant just tax co2 it wont do jack shit, all it will ever do is that the price of the products goes up that is all it will do, and the only possible way to solve it this way is to tax things so much we cant afford them, that is the only solution taxation can give us.   You might be surprised but I agree with you here. My own party for example is strictly against CO2 taxes which puts the pressure on the working class, makes goods more expensive, and worst, taxes are not dedicated they always just go into the state budget. So basically you've increased the state budget... and what? There is no guarantee that they are put to good use to actually fight climate change, they haven't done so before.  The only reason they do this is to disincentivise consumption which is Malthusian logic (we must consume less otherwise we won't survive, there is no alternative, yadda yadda) to just make people poorer so they have a lesser CO2 footprint instead of changing the system of energy production. They haven't passed the CO2 tax in Germany yet and my party will definitely take the streets when they try to do this.

If you talk to actual fascists, most of them acknowledge climate change. They'll push for environmental policies occasionally, under the pretext of ""preserving the homeland"" or whatever, Hitler himself pioneered that. But given that they are fascists, they won't care if climate change kills millions of brown people.   The right-wing in power, the emerging populist right of the likes of Trump, Bolsonaro, etc. are very much paid off by fossil fuel industries and other lobbies.   &gt;Most people would agree humans do have some effect on our climate but nowhere to the degree that leftists would have us believe. Like that the world is going to end in 10 years or something crazy like that.   Not in 10 years, but it's pretty much agreed upon in the scientific community that in 10 years we will have to deal with feedback loops that are beyond our control (for example the release of methane through the poles melting). You don't have to literally imagine a hell planet, but anybody who knows the implications of even small changes, like a temperature rise of 1° Celsius up to 2030, will tell you that this shit will cause mass migrations from the global south, especially in Africa, through the reduction of arable. The migrant crisis of the last 4 years will be chickenshit compared to that.  &gt;We believe that people are sensationalizing the topic and trying to capitalize on it. We believe that the earth has been through cycles for millions of years and it’s natural.   Yes, but we haven't.  &gt;There’s nothing we can do that will stop the climate from heating. Mars is heating up and having a lot of ice melt as well. So it’s something much bigger than us.   This is actually climate denialism, 99% of all scientists agree that climate change is largely man-made."

Who exactly believes that the world is going to end in 10 years? I've seen a number of people in the media and on the internet claiming that other people are saying this, but rather less people actually saying this. Suspicious...  Anyways, the anticipated effects within 10 years, if the IPCC model is accurate, are much more specific and limited than ""world ending"". Coral die-off is probably the most immediate change ([actually already happening](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2018/08/explore-atlas-great-barrier-reef-coral-bleaching-map-climate-change/)), which will have large ramifications for economies based around tourism and fishing (the loss of reefs will also cause a large decrease in fish populations, who share symbiotic relationships with reefs), and potentially unknown further effects on the environment. Flooding, both along the coasts and rivers, is anticipated to rise, as well as other unusual weather events (droughts etc.).  But world-ending? If you're in a sweet spot like northeastern US, much of western Europe, etc. you probably won't be all that affected by climate change in 10 years, although certain luxuries like fish, certain types of fruit, etc. might become drastically more expensive. Tourism in countries like Iceland and Switzerland, where glaciers are melting faster than they're flowing during winter, will probably be hurt. But overall, winters in those select areas might become more bearable, and growing seasons might become longer. Not to mention that wealthy economies will be most predisposed to compensate for climate change losses using new industrial technology (e.g. [artificial pollination to deal with loss of pollinating insects?](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2017/03/03/517785082/rise-of-the-robot-bees-tiny-drones-turned-into-artificial-pollinators)).  The most catastrophic effects are going to be in developing and food-insecure economies, where increasing prevalence of droughts and flooding are likely to make some areas inhospitable. Much of the migration from various African countries, Bangladesh, etc. to areas like Europe or the US [is already being driven by changes in climate](https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-climate-crisis-migration-and-refugees/), and this is estimated to increase.  No, the world won't literally end in 10 years (a low bar if I've ever seen one) but it will become - *is becoming* - a much harsher place to live in for many people, especially in developing economies. Unfortunately, the populations primarily driving climate change won't directly/immediately face these effects, which will inevitably lead some of them to decry recognition of these effects as exaggeration.  &gt;We believe that the earth has been through cycles for millions of years and it’s natural.  The Earth certainly does go through cycles, and the Earth going through cycles is certainly ""natural"" (i.e. would happen with or without humans). But are you saying that the observed climate patterns on Earth in the last few decades is therefore merely Earth going through a cycle, and therefore natural? That's almost certainly false.  We know very precisely, based on careful experimentation, the heat-trapping properties of CO2, and that CO2 is a byproduct of burning various fossil fuels (e.g. coal and oil). Moreover, we can distinguish between CO2 emitted by burning fossil fuels and CO2 emitted by ""natural"" processes (e.g. photosynthesis, emissions by volcanos, etc.) by [analyzing the isotopic concentration](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/education/isotopes/) of CO2 molecules. Chemists have done this sort of isotopic analysis on the atmosphere and found that about 25% of CO2 in the atmosphere is from human activities. Satellite data also rules out other potential ""natural"" explanations of warming, such as sun brightness, since  [irradiance has been decreasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_dimming) during the last few decades.  And just a final point. Even if one concedes that Earth is merely going through a ""natural"" cycle, that still might result in so-called ""world-ending"" catastrophic effects. These sorts of natural cycles tend to last tens of thousands of years. All of human civilization - how we grow food, the crops we rely on, where we decided to settle, etc. - is predicated on the phase of the ""cycle"" that we've been in for the last few millenia and that we're familiar with. If we are indeed reaching a different phase in Earth's natural cycles, this could still spell troubles for human civilization.  &gt;There’s nothing we can do that will stop the climate from heating.   Even if this is true, we *can* act in a way which will decrease the proportion of climate change which is anthropogenic, lessening the speed and intensity of heating and thus the potential impacts. Even economists like Nordhaus, who tends to be rather conservative in his estimates of economic damage from climate change, have supported the need for a steep carbon tax so that the incentives for using fossil fuels reflect the estimated environmental externalities of its use.  &gt;Mars is heating up and having a lot of ice melt as well. So it’s something much bigger than us.  Yes and no. It's true that Mars does go through heating/cooling cycles, but not in a way that's comparable to Earth at all. There's two factors here which are relevant: first, Mars has a far more elliptical orbit than Earth; in our solar system, Mars is the  planet with the second most eccentric orbit, beyond only Mercury. Its obit is about 6x as eccentric as Earth's orbit. This means that Mars faces much more extreme external warming factors as it moves closer/further from the sun in its orbit.   Second, the atmosphere on Mars is extremely thin, so there's practically no thermal inertia. Virtually all of warming patterns on Mars are therefore caused by external factors (such as distance to the sun). This is very different from the Earth, where the thick atmosphere (the thing that makes life possible) allows for internal warming factors such as the so-called greenhouse effect.  Also, we don't actually know if Mars has had a long-term warming pattern. It's very hard to empirically measure this on other planets, so generally what astronomists have done is observe changes in albedo (the reflection of sunlight by specular surfaces) and try to extrapolate warming patterns from that. However, this is done too infrequently and too inaccurately to estimate a long-term *trend*; rather, these measurements could just reflect weather events observed on those days (e.g. dust storms, varying positions in orbit, etc.)."

Socialism is the system which leads to the tragedy of the commons, when the state ignores the minority of people affected by pollution for the benefit of the majority which benefit from getting products cheaper, which means taking shortcuts like dumping waste into the river, which the people have no means to appeal against. In capitalism, an individual who has their private property violated can turn to the state and sue the polluter, because that property is *that individual's property,* and they have a right to control it. When the state owns the property you live on...well, they've already made their decision, and you're SoL.   &gt;winning a war does not mean having a better economy, but just having a higher production.  Which is hard when you have a bad economy.  &gt;a totalitarian dictatorship can win a war but let the citizens live like slaves.  Funny how they keep failing to do...  &gt;for now, here's a cheap article i picked randomly https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/15/climate-china-global-translations-1662345  From the article: ""China is making greater and faster strides than expected away from fossil fuels — becoming the world’s largest investor in solar and wind technology and boasting more jobs in solar energy than in coal-mining.""  Which affirms my point exactly. They're investing because the US is buying, not because of any widespread government economic intervention. Which, frankly, supports my argument that capitalism *promotes* ecological health: technological progress promoted by capitalist reward systems, naturally progresses towards what is ecologically healthy, once technologies are mature.  I love it because the article begrudgingly admits that sort of thing here, though tries to deflect it: ""And they point out that the U.S., which accounts for the second-largest share of world emissions — 15 percent — **has already cut its CO2 emissions over the past decade,** although **that decline was largely the result of power producers switching to cheaper natural gas from coal** *rather than being driven by U.S. climate policy.*""  That sad attempt at a deflection at the end does nothing to dismiss the reality. What is most efficient, either *is most economically efficient,* or will *become most economically efficient** once the technology matures (and isn't actually more ecologically efficient until then, because of the significant resources which need to be pumped into it to create it in the first place, and due to being more of a lower quality first draft in terms of development), which can't be forcibly rushed without actually harming progress in the long run. That shift from coal to natural gas represents this sort of dynamic occurring. Solar and wind are ridiculously economically inefficient for now, but they will become economically efficient once the technologies mature and they can actually make up for their own carbon footprint to a significant degree."

Countries no matter how free the trade is or how much personal freedoms there is.  Any large population first world country and its people are contributors.  If the us was suddenly socialist tomorrow, we’d still need food, and cars and power.    Where capitalism does carry more fault is because of capitalism we have had an explosion of people, and people are living longer.  There is more use of resources but it isn’t because capitalism just demands more.  It is more nuanced then that. If capitalism never took hold like it did, we’d probably have half the world population we do now, life expectancy would be half, there would be greater absolute poverty, starvation, and sickness? But the environment would be well preserved.  That’s true.  But that would only be the case if you changed the course of the world 200 years ago.  If you flipped the switch today, you still have the 7 billion people, most of which are used to a life of food, transportation, fair work conditions, healthcare of some form, etc.  if you flipped the switch and suddenly they were all socialist, doesn’t change how much gas and oil and food consumption there is unless you are going to go Mao and Stalin on the matter and reduce the number of mouths exponentially.  It is all a number of people problem.  If a virus right now wiped out 50-60% of the world, but the current economic system stayed in place, we wouldn’t be doing as much farming and drilling and burning as we do now.  So capitalism would still exist, and environment would get better.  So it isn’t capitalism, just that we have a fuck load of people (which is a consequence of capitalism).  What that means also is even if 60% of the population died, as long as there is capitalism, the numbers will grow again and at some point get back to what they were."

Stop. Let's assume for a second the first part of the sentence (that capitalism wouldn't have a solution to those problem) would be true: The second part of the sentence cannot be concluded from that.  First of all capitalism doesn't _lead_. The way you use the term _lead_ you make it seem as if capitalism was an agent that could be responsible for something. It is not. Capitalism is a system that is the consequence of human action and interaction without being actively impeded by other human beings.  Then, since capitalism also is the best known system in terms of using natural resources _efficiently_ it offers the best chance there is to survive the coming natural disasters.  &gt; TL;DR: if you want to grow a plantation to produce seeds, you don't eat the seeds.

It’s pretty neat idea on it’s own, even if we exclude compassion.  It just so happened that it’s inferior to capitalism. Turns out “greedy capitalists” actually provide more value to society that common workers realized. The best way to make companies run as efficient as possible is to make owners benefit from it. Plus competition is a great driver too.   Monopolies are problematic, but socialism is monopoly of the state too."
Emoticone11,2020-01-05 20:22:04,fdbbfhk,t3_ek9dtv,t1_fd8qfwl,"&gt; We cant just tax co2 it wont do jack shit, all it will ever do is that the price of the products goes up that is all it will do, and the only possible way to solve it this way is to tax things so much we cant afford them, that is the only solution taxation can give us.  That’s *literally the entire point* of a carbon tax (aka a Pigouvian tax). Pollution is an example of what’s called a “negative externality“ in economics, meaning that because the people producing carbon don’t directly “feel” all of the costs of carbon pollution, they’re bound to produce too much of it and set a price lower than the optimal price. Another way to put this is that markets are efficient when prices reflect all relevant costs/information, but in the case of carbon pollution, prices fail to take into account all relevant costs/information. Particularly, the price of carbon doesn’t reflect the costs of damage from climate change.  The price of carbon going up, as well as those of products created using carbon, is actually a good thing. If we can’t afford the side-effects of consuming something, we shouldn’t be able to afford to consume that thing. If, through taxes, we can make carbon consumers directly “feel” the extra costs of pollution, the amount of carbon used is going to decrease closer to the social optimum (and investing in alternatives such as nuclear power will suddenly become profitable, which is also a good thing). Whether the tax burden is ultimately passed on to producers or consumers is mostly irrelevant from the perspective of pollution."

Emoticone11,2020-01-05 21:06:43,fdbl0f1,t3_ek9dtv,t1_fdb5vhk,"&gt; Immigration both drives a budget deficit, as these people take more in welfare than they give in taxes  Are you talking from a US perspective? This [isn't really true](https://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=23550), at least in a straightforward way. Immigrants actually have positive budget impacts on the federal level (meaning that they pay more in federal taxes than they take out in federal benefits). Overall they have a negative budget impact at the state and local level, but it varies dramatically from state to state - in Texas, for instance, [immigrants have a positive impact at the state level](https://web.archive.org/web/20141213205836/http://www.window.state.tx.us/specialrpt/undocumented/undocumented.pdf). There are a number of reasons for this, but primarily the reason is that most of the benefits applicable to immigrants are offered by state/local governments, but the type of taxes levied by state/local governments don't recoup most of the contributions made by immigrants. Meanwhile, immigrants shoulder a significant portion of federal taxes, but generally don't use federal benefits such as social security.  On the net (i.e. looking at both federal and state/local contributions) immigrants do pay more in taxes than they take out in benefits. This is pretty intuitive, since most immigrants can't actually apply for most benefits until they reach permanent residence status (~5 years). Meanwhile, they pay most forms of taxes."

silakto339,2020-01-05 21:22:13,fdbo2lx,t3_ekbqr6,t1_fdb7p89,"this is false. how much we produce now is way more than we need. we think we need this much because we are used to base our happiness on material wealth, and therefore we think that, in order for society to function, we ""need"" all this stuff. we instead need much less. look up food waste and all that stuff.  http://www.fao.org/save-food/resources/keyfindings/en/ furthermore you have to take into account the rebound effect. diminishing the production of something doesn't mean diminishing it's output, because we would increase efficiency. could we? yes, because currently we do the opposite: as soon as we can increase production of something, companies which don't take advantage of it to bankrupt (bc they get out competed).  the result is that we always produce the product which consumes as much as possible.  reversing this system through regulations (impossible under capitalism, read the PS) would change history.   we have no idea how little we can live on. if a socialist state could impose everyone to eat less meat then we could feed 10b people with our current output. then consider we throw away one third of our food, etc, etc. human happiness wouldn't be affected because it relies on perception of how lucky one is compared to the neighborhood, not on reality."
AHAPPYMERCHANT,2020-01-05 21:24:38,fdbods4,t3_ek9dtv,t1_fdbl0f1,"You're conflating second-generation with first-generation immigrants. I'm talking exclusively about first-generation immigrants.   You're also conflating the average with the median immigrant. Immigrants are largely divided into two pools, a large mass of poorly educated, poor immigrants and the fewer, wealthy elite immigrants. The wealthier ones tend to contribute more, but that's not what people are talking about when they complain about open borders. Most have little concern with a few hundred thousand well-educated rich folks coming to America. Even if the average did benefit people, the median immigrant is taking resources. We don't have to take everyone. Instead we can simply deny entry to anyone who would be a financial cost to us.   &gt;Are you talking from a US perspective? This isn't really true,  From your own article:  \&gt;Over the period 1994-2013, the net fiscal contribution (federal, state, and local combined) of first-generation immigrants was, on average, consistently less favorable than that of native-born generations.   The only way you get them to be a positive impact at the Federal level is by taking a massive time horizon of nearly a century (the study says 75 years), and they're still negative at the local and state level. Keep in mind that this calculation includes both the first-generation itself and the second-generation, which is the one which actually contributes (unsurprisingly, as they're native-born Americans just like us).   &gt; in Texas, for instance, immigrants have a positive impact at the state level. There are a number of reasons for this, but primarily the reason is that most of the benefits applicable to immigrants are offered by state/local governments, but the type of taxes levied by state/local governments don't recoup most of the contributions made by immigrants.  I can't search this article because it's a pdf, so could you point me to the relevant portion of it?   This is wrong, at least according to [this article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/09/28/these-maps-show-how-immigrants-affect-your-states-budget/) I found, which I'll use because I can't Ctrl-F your one. Only a handful of states have immigrants benefiting the budget on average, and it's almost exclusively poor, deep red rural states like OK or MT. It's states which offer little and less in benefits and where immigrants are hardly flocking.   &gt;This is pretty intuitive, since most immigrants can't actually apply for most benefits until they reach permanent residence status (~5 years).  The primary cost to us is educating their children, which they cannot be denied regardless of residency. I guess calling that welfare was misleading on my part.  This also isn't the intuitive part. A 5 year wait on benefits is modest when you consider that most of these people arrive in their youth and thus are eligible for benefits for most of their lives (I want to say about ~3/4 on average, but that's just a guess). Rather, the intuitive part that limits their Federal benefits is that most benefits only apply to the elderly. Since they're younger at arrival, it takes longer to collect benefits."

Simply saying “read some marx” doesn’t really clear things up.   And then you’ve got middle managers and white collar crime. Proletariat in high positions exploiting other proletariat using their high positions. There’s got to be a grey area somewhere."

Emoticone11,2020-01-06 00:49:41,fdccsx8,t3_ek9dtv,t1_fdbods4,"&gt; You're conflating second-generation with first-generation immigrants. I'm talking exclusively about first-generation immigrants.  I'm not conflating a single thing. I'm well aware that first-generation and second-generation immigrants are different people. However, focusing exclusively on first-generation immigrants is incoherent.  As you mention, the primary benefits taken by first-generation immigrants are the costs of their childrens' education. If you count this as a cost in your calculations, you also have to add to your balance sheet the estimated future tax paid by the children of the first-generation immigrants.  Consider a first-generation immigrant who takes no benefits *except* for public education for their children, and who pays federal taxes. If you are indeed focusing exclusively on first-generation immigrants as you claim, then you would concede that such an immigrant is a net fiscal benefit: they take no benefits *towards themselves*, and pay taxes. The moment you consider investment in their children's education as a cost, you also have to consider the payoff from this investment, or else your cost/benefit analysis is completely meaningless. It would render policy statements like this incoherent, for instance: *""Instead we can simply deny entry to anyone who would be a financial cost to us.""*, if the financial cost is calculated by omitting future payoffs from second-generation children of immigrants.  &gt;You're also conflating the average with the median immigrant. &gt; ... &gt;Even if the average did benefit people, the median immigrant is taking resources.  I'm not aware of any attempts to study the median budgetary impact of immigrants. Care to link the source of your claim here?  &gt;Most have little concern with a few hundred thousand well-educated rich folks coming to America.  Make no mistake, America's ass-backwards immigration policy hurts well-educated immigrants nonetheless. I personally work with an Iranian PhD student who's currently unable to get into the US because their visa was arbitrarily revoked. They've been stuck in Tehran for about 2 years now and have had to put their program on hold. And you've probably heard of ICE's recent confrontation with the terrifying national security threat of... [Indian students trying to get master degrees in Computer Science](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2019/11/27/ice-set-up-fake-university-then-arrested-people-it-gave-student-visas/).  &gt;We don't have to take everyone. Instead we can simply deny entry to anyone who would be a financial cost to us.  Based on what, exactly? A scrying ball? Neither the ""average"" nor ""median"" person actually exists (or if they do, they have approximately 1 testicle and 1 ovary, which is kind of freaky). It might be true that if you deny entry to enough people with such and such superficial characteristic you might be able to change net expenditures (although you can never actually *know* that this is the case, because you can't calculate estimates for events which didn't happen), but promulgating this as systematically denying entry to people who are a financial cost would clearly be wrong, since some of the people denied might not be a financial cost.  Nor do I concede that we ought to prevent someone from migrating to the US on the basis of fiscal impact, even if they were personally a fiscal cost. If I did support such a thing, I naturally (given that I have no *a priori* reason to privilege someone born in California above someone born in Mexico) would conclude that *no* individual should be allowed in the US unless they can demonstrate that they're a net fiscal benefit. This means that (a) citizenship should not be granted to children of American citizens automatically, and (b) any American citizen can be deported at any time should they become a net fiscal cost. But I find this implication unpalatable, and I think most Americans would as well.  &gt;From your own article:  The article says that the average net fiscal contribution of first-generation immigrants is less favorable than native citizens. *This is true*. It doesn't, however, mean that the average net fiscal contribution isn't positive. This is simple to illustrate: 5 is less than 10, but both numbers are positive.  &gt;The only way you get them to be a positive impact at the Federal level is by taking a massive time horizon of nearly a century (the study says 75 years)  And why wouldn't you consider the entire life of an immigrant when doing a cost/benefit analysis? It's pretty natural to do so; below in your response, you do the exact same. What time period would you propose instead?  &gt;they're still negative at the local and state level  Right, which I've acknowledged. This doesn't necessarily reflect immigrants being a *net* fiscal burden, but rather just the fact that immigrants tend to reflect a *transfer* of wealth from the local/state level to the federal level. As the article discusses, immigrants primarily use benefits offered at the local/state level, but the money is generally recouped at the federal level via federal taxes. If this is indeed the case, money can be transferred from the federal level back to the states/municipalities burdened by immigration, so the net negative impacts on the state/local level aren't inherently a problem.  &gt;I can't search this article because it's a pdf, so could you point me to the relevant portion of it?  Look at Exhibit 18 for the summary. The revenues from state/local taxes are about $1.6 billion, and the costs to the state are about $1.2 billion. However, checking the study again, it appears to focus only on undocumented immigrants. Perhaps this makes a difference in the calculations compared to grouping together all immigrant households, but I'm not entirely sure why."

In some cases (even government is smart enough to avoid this most of the time), it results in the lender getting (eventually) either their money back or their money back plus interest and any fees, so the price of irrationality to the lender is very low (or they maybe even profit, if the government pays the interest as well).

Leftists posit, not unreasonably, that any correlation between poverty and vulnerability to predatory loans is partly indicative of causation. You attribute it entirely to the fact that leftists aren't managing ""the poor"" correctly. But the reason they don't deliver *your* lecture is that they don't agree with your managerial philosophy, they dispute your dogma that the correlation is not at all indicative of causation.    In other words, you're throwing a wobbly over the fact that some people disagree with you about how best to manage (or farm) the poor, not giving them any reason to start agreeing with you.

That being said, for anyone who might actually be sincere, if the argument that credit and lending can be “tools” for working people to acquire capital and become “upwardly mobile,” I’d have to ask how and by whom are rates determined (is it a public institution that determines conditions and rates democratically? If rates are greater than inflation, are they privately profited or publicly reinvested); to whom does the revenue accumulate and what are the circumstances of its reinvestment and management (is crediting institution accountable to the public, is it open and transparent, are surpluses privately profited or do they fund public budgets?); and are there simple mechanisms for debt forgiveness and preventions against debt peonage?"

I guess this puts me somewhere near emotivism, quasi-realism, and a few other theories, but I wouldn't consider myself strictly tied down to any of them right now.

Regardless, as a Marxist, my politics involves the rejection of ethics as a legitimate *foundation* for political theory, and I in no way require it to hold any of my key political positions (which can of course be surmised as: *the abolition of private property*, or, more simply, *communism*); whatever my ethics, I would still be a Marxist (though a poor one if I ever gave any serious weight to my hypothetical moral convictions when they were put up against Marxism)."

This is based on a premise that the trajectory of research for the former seems more likely to be monotonic than the latter (meaning the chance of having to “undo” previous research to make further advances seems smaller), and relies on less philosophical unknowns (e.g. what precisely quantifies consciousness)."

Flooring is slightly harder depending on what type of floor you want and the room type (getting a robot to tile the corners of a room would be tricky, wood flooring would be harder, but with time and effort it could be automated. Whether it is desirable for it to automated is for the market to decide.). By cabinets I assume you mean electrical cabinets, which are made of standard parts, so some thoughtful redesign and working on a robot that can deal with wires, and that's solved. HVAC is more standard fittings. Repair jobs are the type of thing that's a bit more tricky, so it'll appeal to engineers to solve it cleverly.

Technically speaking, ""AI"" is a heuristic way of interpreting optimization: the main point is who decides what to optimize. The solution(s) to a complex optimization problem may be hard to interpret, but the problem itself in general is not. The machines-taking-control scenario is based on the possibility that computer scientists, mathematicians, engineers, philosophers and politicians agree to let machines decide what to optimize. In order for this scenario to become realistic, something very different from what we are experiencing now should happen. Meanwhile, the big companies that have access to data will continue to develop ""AI"" for commercial purposes. Which, in my opinion, is already dystopia."

I was referring to cupboards, the cabinets in a kitchen or bathroom. They're usually custom, and often require shimming to make the tops level. The job is not standard enough for a robot to do. Same as a mechanic for internal combustion cars. Electric cars, maybe, but combustion engines are complex enough it takes a decent amount of creativity to solve most problems. Also, when installing wood or imitation wood flooring, the one of the most important things is to *not* make a pattern. Wood floors look best when the pieces are randomized, so I doubt a robot could ever do that effectively. I actually thin tile could be easier a robot to do. Just have a CNC type machine in the room, with a suction cup on a telescoping arm, and write in the tile size and patterns, along as you precut the pieces for it, and stack them in the right order, but that would require doing so much math and measuring, it wouldn't be worth it. You'd also have to figure out how to make the robot spread the mortar, but not too much, because it would dry out before the tile got to it.   Maybe if we create a true, general ai, and have humanoid robots, with at least as much strength and mobility as us, we could have them repair stuff, but that's just asking for a robot uprising."

Think of something like psychiatry, that's something that robots won't take over for a long time. Maybe hookers fall into this category, but I think a large portion of people would switch to machines for that :)  Raw resources are something that will always be needed. Considering we're in a futuristic setting, perhaps those people could mine asteroids for metal and sent them home to build more machines.  Space is something that's always needed, these people could start terraforming deserts, or perhaps even planets.  If everything runs on machines, engineers would be massively useful. Not just electrical engineers, but also software developers.  Science is an incredibly complex thing which machines won't take over from us for a long time, so people could do science.  Maybe they can work in culture too, like producing movies and music, but I think machines will be pretty good at taking that over from us."

""My side will win, because my opposition doesn't agree with me and my side is right"". Yeah... sure...  &gt;he world climate is manifestly in danger. By virtue of that fact, I don't think right-wing populism will engender a regime change in their favor for long, and it has been well documented.  Populists won't be able to gain a majority, because the earth is heating up? You do know that populism and temperature aren't bound by each other right?  &gt;There's also this conflation between fascism and right-wing populism in Europe, I think those *fascists* are libertarians who espouse the free market. None of the PM's or Presidents in Europe in favor of closed borders, etc, espouse economic corporatism à la Fascism, since that involves management of sectors of the economy by government or privately-controlled organizations (corporations).  There's conflation between fascism and any right-wing movement. People love to throw the fascist ""insult"" at anyone who takes a right wing stance and it's pretty much lost all its power by now.   I'm a dutch libertarian, we have no one who advocates for closed borders, but there are a bunch of political parties who want to bring border control to our own sovereignty again instead of letting the EU decide who enters our countries. Countries who have been hit harder by immigration are more likely to advocate for closed borders, like in Scandinavia or England. For instance, Nordfront lists this as their first issue:  &gt;*1. Immediately stop the mass immigration. Repatriation of the majority of all who are not northern European or of closely related descent is to begin as soon as possible. They are to be returned to their respective countries of origin or neighboring regions in the most humane way possible.*  There aren't many libertarians in the Netherlands, but they are growing and whenever I get into a discussion with someone about it they tend to be rather surprised about how nice it sounds. So I do think a lot of Europeans have been primed to convert to libertarian-ism or something similar."

I figured that in order to be physically strong, you have to be out and working. People like farmers who work brutal hours and spend days hauling stuff become more physically strong. They also work in an environment where they have to be almost self sufficient. I think that's why they like capitalism, they feel like they worked for themselves and only they should earn the profit.  People in cities don't work physically hard, instead they spent hours in school as a child and then spent hours at the office as an adult. They don't train their muscles, they train their brains. They also work in an environment where everyone is codependent on each other, because everyone is specialized. I think that's why they like socialism, they feel like they need to co operate in order to make a system work.  If you look at election maps, you often see that the countryside is right wing, while cities are left wing, which fits my theory."

The idea being is that we want a life which is ""good"". How do I define good? I don't know, but if you experience stress it wasn't good, if you experience happiness it was good. Everyone needs to do different things to feel stress or happiness. Learning about the wars of the past is very fun to me, but I have a friend who calls me insane for it because he thinks I'm poisoning my head with thoughts of death. So for me, learning about wars is good, for him, learning about wars is bad.  So if everyone has a different sense of what good and bad is, I would then conclude that we shouldn't have too many centralization. None which are forced at least, if people voluntarily centralize because that's what makes them feel secured and good, by all means go for it. If someone wants out because he doesn't feel good with all that centralization, he should also be able to go for it."

So its trading regulation for regulation.

This presumes many things that are not true. Socialists don't view the poor as infants. They view them as class of people being exploited because they weren't lucky enough to be born into opulent wealth. The goal of a socialist is to extinguish the private ownership of production and make it the common wealth of every living person. This is important because when the people who make the decisions on what a business does are also the people directly impacted by those decisions. So, these people aren't going to vote to send their jobs to China because it's cheaper, or ignore the environmental damage they're doing because they would be harming themselves, not a bunch of far-away strangers they pay to do the work for them.  This idea that credit and lending is the magic bullet solution to lifting people out of poverty is tone-deaf in the face of the fact that for the past 40 years, the cost of living has been rising, while wages have stayed the same. 40 years ago, people could pay for college with a part-time job and could afford a house on a full-time job. Rent wasn't 50% or more of your monthly wages. What's worse, is that productivity over the same time span has tripled. So people produce three times as much as 40 years ago, but make the same wages their parents did at the same age. Our wages do not reflect how much we produce. The problem is that we are being ripped off by our employers. We give them more and more productivity every year and they refuse to compensate us proportionately.

So you're fine with the government forcing poor people to learn proper financial skills, but you're opposed to the government *actually protecting people* from bad financial decisions?  Of course, even ignoring that hypocrisy, let's take your statement at face value. Let's assume that predatory lending exists because poor people use lending irresponsibly, and not because banks and lending companies want to take advantage of people.  Your solution doesn't work.  Even if you add a financial skills course to every public school, most people will likely forget said class after they graduate, as they do with most public school classes. Even if you have the best teachers in the world teaching a class, by pure probability, most of the people who take that class won't take interest in finances. And unless you have a job in finance, you aren't making financial decisions day in and day out, so those financial skills don't get built upon.  Finance is like math - not everyone has an aptitude for it. There will always be people who simply cannot make informed financial decisions. Not because they're stupid, but simply because their brains are wired ever so slightly differently. Therefore, any system which depends on people making informed decisions is doomed to failure.  In the end, even if we accept your initial supposition (which isn't even correct but I doubt I'll persuade you on that), government intervention - the outlawing of predatory loan practices - is still the only possible solution to the problem."

Considering that a television cost months of income in the 1970's, and less than a day's income today, I think this point is beyond incorrect.  You can repeat this with nearly every consumer product.  An hour of labor has never purchased so much lifestyle.  That's because the machines are providing more value from that hour of labor.  When automation has lowered the cost of survival down to a small point, then any humans don't need to provide services to each other to earn survival income, more of it is disposable income.  So work weeks continue to drop (just like they have since the late 1800's), and the time available for education increases, too.    And education has gotten progressively easier, especially if you don't use the government-controlled paths, and instead just start learning things that are useful.    &gt; However, the workers will be computers, not humans.   And learning how to code has never been easier.  No college degree required.  YouTube videos, the software is more likely to be free than ever before.  A person with average intelligence can literally incrementally improve their skills enough to be functionally programming.  &gt; The remaining humans will not have jobs, which in a  communistic/socialistic society won't make much of a difference, but in a  capitalist society, there will be no way for the remaining majority of  the population to gain money.   Incorrect, or at least speculative.  As survival continues to become easier, a higher percentage of income is disposable, and human provided services and objects would still be valuable.  Sure, a toaster-oven would be made by machines, but humans are always going to prefer a human masseuse, and human artwork.  And if current AI is any indication, it's more likely to be a tool for increased human creativity than a replacement for human creativity.  From an abstract mathematical and algorithmic sense, machines need human input to perform a function.  And capitalism is really good at finding ways to make people useful.  We've replaced 95% of our food farmers, 100% of our ice farmers, about 90% of our typists and file clerks.

This isn't selfish because they may even put their own lives down for said moral.  This is not a rational conclusion because there is no rational conclusion to morals. Morals are logic built off our emotion and it's illogical to assume that others morals are the same when they have a different axiom/foundation. There will never be a consensus only most people being happy about things. Ultimately that's the most practical best option as well as encouraging empathic emotions so the majority have their morals built upon said emotions and care still for the minority.

The only option to make the needle go more socialist in the nation is through mass strikes and violent revolution, which would be hard given the level of wage slavery - the ruling class wouldn't have trouble literally starving the movement.

It may be  authoritarian, which necessarily leads to the death of the community,  and it may be libertarian, which in the twelfth century even under the  partial communism of the young cities of that age, led to the creation  of a young civilisation full of vigour, a new springtide of Europe.   &gt;   &gt;The only durable form of Communism, however, is one under which,  seeing the close contact between fellow men it brings about, every  effort would be made to extend the liberty of the individual in all  directions.   &gt;   &gt;Under such conditions, under the influence of this idea, the liberty  of the individual, increased already by the amount of leisure secured  to him, will be curtailed in no other way than occurs today by municipal  gas, the house to house delivery of food by great stores, modern  hotels, or by the fact that during working hours we work side by side  with thousands of fellow labourers.   &gt;   &gt;With Anarchy as an aim and as a means, Communism becomes possible.

No political party from Washington has the right to tax money from your family to spend on their desires. You don't have the right to do that to others.  And I didn't just say protect but provide an advantage to their family meaning taking and stepping on others for their family to prosper.  Practically people are jealous and greedy and will want more power always causing them to attempt to take what others have through any means. Democracy ensures the limitation of this to keep as many people as possible happy and thankfully while there are jealous people there are also empathetic people who despite being in a majority will look out for the minority."

Fordler,2020-01-08 16:12:26,fdkatg5,t3_elt7qc,t3_elt7qc,"I find that Social Democracy gets a mix of love and hatred among most socialists. Most tend to support social democrats' quest to better the lives of workers, however reject their insistence that capitalism can be reformed.  As for my opinion, I fall into much the same category. I support better rights and benefits for workers (healthcare, lower hours, etc.), which Social Democrats are actively fighting for, but reject their capitalist stance, which is the reason most socialists dislike social democracy.  Their are multiple reasons why I and a lot of other socialists reject social democracy. First, reforms will only go so far as the ruling class will allow. The state is primarily controlled by the ruling class through political lobbying (among other tactics). This allows rich members of the ruling class to affect policy decisions, and if those policy decisions hurt the ruling class, they won't allow it to pass by threatening to cut funding to any politician's campaign who voted for it (again, among other tactics). So any reform will only go as far as the ruling class wants it to go, which normally, isn't far enough.  Next there is the issue of how capitalism as a system works. Under social democracy, the exploitation of workers for their surplus labor doesn't go away. The only thing that changes is the financial pain is eased slightly. But being hit with a fist instead of a bat doesn't fix the problem. Social democracy supports the practice  exploitation of working class people by private individuals, even if they make their lives slightly more bearable.  Imperialism also wouldn't go away under social democracy. In a capitalist system, you need resources in order to produce commodities, we all know this. In order to get those resources, your most likely going to have to import them from another country, which will cost money. However, stronger countries can pressure other countries into lowering their prices through threat or application of military force, economic sanctions, etc. If the country refuses, their economy is hurt, which hurts the civilian population. If the country concedes, now the bigger country has a level of influence over that country. This practice continues under social democracy, because markets will still need resources that other countries will charge money for.  There are a myriad of other reasons as to why social democracy is not favored by socialists, too many to list here. I highly recommend visiting some socialist subreddits and asking this question to get a more complete answer.  TLDR: Socialists support the welfare programs and other policies that would benefit workers, however don't support the social democratic stance on capitalism, which causes socialists to dislike social democrats."

They just disagree on their proposed solutions. I find them to be a little more on the defeatist side of realistic, while Market-Socialists are on the optimistic side of realistic.   ---  The result is that Social-Democrats are a pro-capitalist position, something most market-fundamentalists are confused about; so even though under the skin they're closer to Market-Socialists, in practice they're much closer to their capitalist cohorts. One feels that capitalism is worth saving, if we could just get it to work for us, the common people; the other feels that capitalism is not worth saving, because it will never work for us, the common people.  I place them kind of in the same realm of most mainstream capitalism-advocates; most of them (social-democrats and mainstream econ capitalists) are pretty realistic about capitalism, faults, limitations, benefits, strengths, weaknesses. I can respect that because there is at least a conversation to be had, there's an exchange worth making.  Market-Fundamentalists skew this dynamic because they are beyond reason and logic; so it's very difficult to place them in the same category as Social-Democrats or even mainstream economics capitalists.

What you see as wrong or evil will not be evil/wrong in others eyes. Such as killing the Jews   No, you are wrong this is moral relativism but you can logically prove that what happened to the Jews was not justifiable. It comes down to the fact that no person has the right to initiate force. You cannot logically disprove this. That said, I may have been wrong to use the term ""morality"" as this does imply some collective beliefs.  At its core my argument nothing to do with opinions, the same way the Pythagorean theorem is more than an opinion - it is an objective reality. Drop something and it will fall to the earth. We have the highest authority over our own bodies, not somebody else. Otherwise, by what logic can someone claim higher authority over your body?  &gt;Practically people are jealous and greedy  I agree. That is why I'm opposed to coercive governments.

The second kind are the ""revolutionary"" social democrats that have no love for capitalism but simply don't know how to end it so they weaken it. The second type tend to be more popular in the Americas with Bernie Sanders, Evo Morales, AMLO, and Lula all being the second type. I personally have a hunch that they are a necessary transitional stage between capitalism and socialism. The reason they are so much better is because they are in rhetoric allies to socialists.  They will strengthen unions and co-ops until capitalism is weak and withers away. I think capitalism will end much like feudalism. There will be a mix of gradual change and revolutions, with one big revolution towards the end."

dog_snack,2020-01-08 19:13:09,fdktfu9,t3_elt7qc,t3_elt7qc,"Social democracy, to me, should be a stepping stone to a market socialist economy. I don’t believe that an entire economic paradigm can shift overnight.   When a predominately capitalist order of things is maintained, there is always a risk that things will go backwards and take us back to square one. You can’t placate a capitalist; they will inevitably try to put themselves back on top, at the expense of others, when they get an opportunity.   In the US, FDR thought he could get the socialists to settle for a decent welfare state and the capitalists for the regulations and top marginal tax rates that entailed. But the capitalist class had some tricks up their sleeves—while the economy grew by leaps and bounds in the postwar period, the capitalists began a decades-long propaganda campaign that gave birth to the modern conservative and libertarian movements. You had the witch hunt that was the Second Red Scare (aka McCarthyism), and the emergence of innumerable right-wing think tanks and publications (the stated objective of *National Review* magazine was to “stand athwart history, yelling stop”—very telling!)   And in Sweden in the 1970s and 80s—often cited as the gold standard for social democracy—you had a sort-of attempt at converting social democracy to market socialism by requiring large firms to gradually transfer more and more shares of the company into worker funds that would eventually have made workers, as a group, majority shareholders. But then Prime Minister Palme got assassinated and the Social Democrats lost power, so the “Meidner Plan” went out the window and neoliberalism came to Scandinavia too.   Bottom line: social democracy can make some great progress, but by itself it will always be a half-measure, a compromise that will always be lopsided."

It is one of  the means used by men for their all-round advancement. The power to  control national life through national representatives is called  political power. Representatives will become unnecessary if the national  life becomes so perfect as to be self-controlled. **It will then be a  state of enlightened anarchy in which each person will become his own  ruler. He will conduct himself in such a way that his behaviour will not  hamper the well-being of his neighbours.** In an ideal State there  will be no political institution and therefore no political power.

They would be wrong and here is why:  The natural state of man is poverty. We have a variety of useful tools and jobs to choose from due to the progress of free-market innovators who came before us. Socialists see the wealth around them and believe that it is the natural state of man to be wealthy. So having accumulated no wealth and having no real influence or authority in society, they feel entitled to initiate force or the threat thereof on the larger community to take from their collective wealth.   The initiation of force is always wrong for logical reasons. Each person has the highest claim to his body and limited time, energy. Private property is an extension of this because the body time and energy are used to create or obtain property. So, in order to take from the individual, one must prove they have a higher claim to someone else's stuff but they cannot. Instead, they will try to justify theft and violence through voting and victimhood mentality."

willb2989,2020-01-08 22:11:22,fdld5eo,t3_elt7qc,t1_fdl4wh5,"Woof.  Nice set of quotes to paint government itself as the root of all evil.  Very nicely done sir.  I can't even remember song lyrics.  You sir, have talent.  While philosophers draw their assumptions from history and anecdote, and - while unfree from bias - are generally not without merit or truth.  I would claim that government is a set of (wo)men guarding and improving laws to achieve a better life for those who participate in a free society and not inherently violent in a world with no need to compete for resources.  It is only the long arm of *law enforcement* that is the 'necessary evil' of a functional government.  So long as the laws made by free and equal people are desired by a free and equal people to defend freedom and equality from the whims of would-be tyrants then a free and equal people should not have need to endure any losses of freedom and equality.  Any laws which violate this would not be laws which secure freedom and equality, but instead their antithesis.  While it may be hypocrisy or even irrational, I defend the notion that a good government created by good people for good people is the desired form of self-government by a society which is by definition a collective.  A collective without a set of guiding rules and principles is anarchy - which is a state of being our society is (currently) woefully ill-equipped to deal with.  In order for an anarchistic society to function, a universal set of guidelines would need to be internalized by every member of the society lest it simply fall to the whims of whichever person or group is able to install a mechanism of control over others (generally through forced deprivation of a necessary resource).  Therefore, despite all evidence to the contrary, I choose to believe it exists in others the goodness I know exists within myself; as such, a good government is indeed possible and one day will be achieved.  Perfection is unachievable.  But the *pursuit* of perfection *without* sacrificing freedom and equality is not means but the goal of a free and equal society.  In the battle against good and evil, stalemate ***is*** victory.  We can achieve a stable and eternal society that advances humanity's infinite potential ad infinitum.  This is what *I* hope to help achieve.  It's why *I* am *choosing* to be a part of the fight for our government.  I believe that we can always be better while ensuring we never lose freedom, equality, or the means to remain free and equal.  If I am alone in being pursuant to this form of government then I will fight alone because even alone I will remain me.  I will not bow to tyrants nor become one.  If the day comes when the people wish to dissolve governments because we no longer need an established set of laws to remind us of fair conduct and continued advancement of progress, then let all government die for we have collectively achieved ***true*** freedom."

ipsum629,2020-01-08 23:56:52,fdln5op,t3_elt7qc,t1_fdlcp3p,"Democratic socialist is a previously rare term that essentially meant ""not quite anarchist but close"". It has come to mean a social democrat that is willing to court other leftists to achieve at least social democracy. A social democrat says social democracy is the most we can do. A democratic socialist says it is the least we can do.  This is clear by Bernie's rhetoric. He himself won't go the extra steps, but he invites people further to the left to build on what he will create. He sees social democracy as a way to encourage the left, rather than satiate it.  What is interesting about this is Sanders has really broad support, with supporters from all over the political spectrum. There are leftists who like Bernie because he is the furthest to the left. There are liberals who like him because he has a proven track record on civil rights. There are centrists who like him because he is an independent. There are conservatives who like him because he goes against the liberal establishment. The common denominator is that he generally draws support from the middle and working class."
SmileyFace-_-,2020-01-09 00:05:16,fdlnwuy,t3_elt7qc,t1_fdkatg5,"&gt;First, reforms will only go so far as the ruling class will allow. The state is primarily controlled by the ruling class through political lobbying (among other tactics).  I strongly disagree. Based on evidence, lobbying is not a major force in Social Democracies. This is based on so many factors that I could probably write a book about it if I cared enough, but in summary, the electoral system, regulations and economic factors which make lobbying relevent are not actually that pertinent in a Social Democracy. Take one example. In the United States, it costs, on average, $2m to run for the HOR and $12m to run for Senate. How is one expected to muster enough money to make that a reality? Lobbying. In comparision, Social Democracies often have very small constituency sizes. It costs next to nothing to run and very little to gain votes. One does not need to be at the whim of a lobbying group to win and make laws. This is why there are very few examples of lobbying making any real difference in Social Democracies and even Liberal Democracies like the UK.   Therefore, to say reforms only go as far as the ruling class allow it, is just wrong in my opinion. In Social Democracies reforms will go as far as the public allow it. You could argue that the public will not go far enough due to false consciousness due to the Capitalistic system they live in, however, if you believe that then you are a revolutionary Socialist by implications anyways.   &gt;Next there is the issue of how capitalism as a system works. Under social democracy, the exploitation of workers for their surplus labor doesn't go away. The only thing that changes is the financial pain is eased slightly.  You make it seem like people who are living in the US go home and cry every night because of ""wage slavery"" and that people in Sweden cry at least once a week due to their ""awful"" predicament.   What you fail to account for is that Social Democracies rank the highest consistently on any index you can find, be it the Happy Planet Index, HDI, SEDA, GII, EFI etc. These people are fine. They're better than fine, they're great, on an almost unprecedented level.  These countries are flourishing. Not only that, they've proven that Social Democracies is the best system we have ever come up with. Now, if there is evidence that people in Socialist countries are living better lives or have lived better lives in the past due to Socialist policies, then you may change my mind, but there isn't. You're merely arguing your point from a belief - it is no better than believing in God and claiming that belief is inherent fact - it's not. In comparison, Social Democracies have got nothing left to prove.   Why should we chase after a system which has failed in the past, against on that has consistent showings of unprecedented success."
Apmagalhaes,2020-01-09 00:24:07,fdlpkj9,t3_elt7qc,t1_fdln5op,"Maybe that's how it is in America. But in Europe, at least in my country, there is still a defining separation between Democratic Socialists and Social Democrats. When we think of Democratic Socialism we think of George Well. An ideology that distinguishes itself from the Stalinist USSR Socialism or Stalinism (which had very little of theoretical socialism), an ideology that nonetheless still aims towards a a true Socialist Society but rather through a democratic reform based process. On the other hand, Social Democracy attempts to bring the best of both worlds at the table, theoretically more left (or more Socialist) than more right (or more Capitalism), center-left that is, but never wanting to go further than that, only aiming to reform Capitalism so that it can a welfare state and an egalitarian society. In my view the are no Revolutionary Social Democrats, if there are any, they are just missinformed and should probably change their political views. Social Democrats mean the Status Quo in most of Europe, in my country at least, just as much as Joe Biden is seen as Status Quo in America (I'm not saying Biden is a Social Democrat)."

That is purely libertarian without a left right bias.  In response to the actual question at hand, its not realistic to say that the people would rise up in some weird revolt over some crappy product but what they would do, and what they already do in our free market socioty is they would avoid a supplier they have heard is selling bad food. The supplier would be forced to either correct their product or slowly lose customers until they cant fund their business. This is basically how it already works, even in recall scenarios people just wait until someone gets sick and when word gets around then a recall is made.

No examples of where eliminating regulation was proven to have increased or maintained quality. Not even examples of successful lawsuits. Just 'duh you don't want your customers to get sick', as if there aren't a million examples of sub-standard products or services being sold despite the fact that this same market mechanism should already be functioning.   These cases, theoretically, shouldn't happen at all, because not only is the apparently ironclad market mechanism already in play, but there's also the (apparently redundant) government with its regulations. It's almost like businesses have to make risk-benefit assessments all the time, and sometimes this has bad results, or better yet some think they can just get away with it.  I'm also curious as to the foundation of these lawsuits. Apparently we can just do away with regulations, so I'm wondering how much contamination is okay if there's no government mandated figure to base it on. If I eat a can of beans that has enough lead in it that if I ate five a week for ten years I'd die, there's hardly going to be any damages when I open the can, test it for lead and discover that fact."

There would be multiple FDA-type businesses, all competing to inspect and show each other up with the best tests and standards. They would all publish their findings independently of each other and so on.   &gt;Since all it takes is a simple no and the for-profit FDA doesn't have any power.   The power they have is in their voice- ""we tested Chipotle and it came back positive for Salmonella, here's the proof, we can't recommend eating here"" is not a weak thing. Chipotle saying ""fuck off"" doesn't carry much weight unless they have a different group say it's okay, in which case you must judge the evidence and see which group has better standards for your needs.   And before you say something like ""so I have to choose between two different opinions on Salmonella?"", you wouldn't. The vast majority of health cases are instances of poor food handling and pests, among other minor things. The main butting-of-heads would be between different agency standards- one might have a very explicit policy that no amount of a certain chemical, say mercury, is acceptable (which would put a huge amount of food today as unsafe), whereas another might put it as equal to the FDA (which is much higher than other places).   &gt;They will also lack the resources to do any research into the sources,as FDA has the CDC and USDA to go along with it.   Are you implying these also wouldn't pop up?   You do realize there are tens of different companies that do car testing alone, for instance, right? What's stopping the world from having the Top Gear magazine, ANCAP (it's even got black and yellow as it's colors) safety ratings and CHOICE product reviews of the food world?

Or some other type of Egalitarian system? I mean I guess those are easier to trust if you consider famine to have less of a risk factor since people eat significantly less. Or do you think that government owned and regulated is somehow safer and easier to trust - because if that's the case, I'd love to hear an example of how those political systems were held accountable and faced consequences when people suffered from salmonella, and mercury poisoning from their state regulated rations. If you don't agree then read up on the Privy council and board of agriculture and the role that the Royal Charter played in causing mad cow disease.   &gt;Or another argument would be a private company would do it and who do you think would own the fake company, the large corporations.  No offense but this statement right here says everything about your level of understanding. When corporations aren't operating within the health code guidelines, it's not as if it's just one person who's health is compromised- it's a multitude of people. And depending on the severity, the economic consequences are dire. Not only is it an inevitable class action lawsuit there are federal fines mandated by the FDA and a  plethora of other federally implemented Health, Disease, Medical and Distribution Administrations, - the cost is anything but cheap. Especially since settlements aren't an option for such federal violations. The corporation also has to undergo audits, inspections, lawyer fees, court fees, increased insurance costs, the mounting costs are endless. Not to mention their sales and reputation take a fat hit. You think anything beyond privatization is more efficient as if the over regulated/ state controlled agriculture and food industry would face the same risks and consequences?   Privately owned s-Corps have more to lose, there's more at stake if they fuck up. That's why they're insured. State owned and regulated- you think the government needs that same kind of insurance? They wouldn't consider it, it's a waste of money. Because no matter what happens - they  dont incur the same risks as a privatized corporation.   First, start with learning the basics - read encyclopedias. Then read some works by Martin Friedman, Thomas Sowell, Zizek, Nietzsche, and Marx. Then decide what it is you oppose and what you stand for. Because right now, you lack the reasons to oppose or support anything. No offense, but you don't understand enough to have an opinion that's consistent with cognitive reason. You're a blind follower. You're free to oppose or support whatever you like without rhyme or reason. But if there isn't a method to your madness then you aren't part of the solution,  you're part of the problem. If you dont know what you're talking about - you'd do  everyone including yourself a service by avoiding ballots.

I suppose in order to curb freeloaders, a patron of this service would receive a personal, secret report on which manufacturers to trust. Of course, this information could be easily stolen and distributed and it doesn’t appear profitable in the long term. Only if we imagine it as a non-profit service does it become sustainable.

You also trust the food because there are other factors.  The government can't pass laws to punish people that take pictures of farms.  Private reviews can be as strict as necessary, but still allow efficient food processing to keep food prices low.

Firstly if you genuinely believe every business owner is some heartless money grabbing terrible person, which just isn’t true. And therefore they cut corners in order to save money, do you really think the smartest thing for them to do is to contaminate or poison their own food?  Killing customers is not a smart financial move, and surely if you thought two seconds about this you would conclude that if all they cared about is money, they would not risk destroying their business to save a few pennies here and there. Clearly you have never run a business.  Secondly in a libertarian society, private quality assessors still exist and review sites still exist. Most people check the reviews of products they buy. That’s nothing to do with the government.  Thirdly in a society where the government isn’t involved in economics, it’s primary purpose is to protect people’s rights.

The corporations you imagine existing will have Guidelines and Rules conducing their internal operation.  Which evidently you state you would ""trust"" the outcome.  My first question, where does this corporation earn it's keep?  How does it exist?  Are you making a monthly subscription for their service?  One time check this bushel of food?  Email notice about their recent discoveries in market's you've deemed worth knowing about?  So, like a tax which runs a government agency.  But, back to my original question:  Do you not believe those corporation rules and operating guidelines are any different than any Government Agency has created over the years?  The inevitable corruptions result from External Manipulation or Internal Malpractice.  These are very broadly referring to a myriad of actions, but simple examples for each:  Your local Fat Cat (in whatever exchange mechanism) forces what ever legislative method required through the CorporationGovernment Bureaucracy which results in an Agency's rules and guidelines being tailor suited.  The other scenario's example is a Bad Actor douche-bag employee whatever who manipulates sufficient steps as to have the desired goal ... we would usually call this Embezzlement or something akin.  My huge labored point is that Rules must exist, and those Rules must be Maintained which requires people and their fraught lives' into affecting your life.  - Vote and Control how your taxes are spent. - Pay Corporate Profits and Control how your fees are spent.

It has come to mean a social democrat that is willing to court other leftists to achieve at least social democracy. A social democrat says social democracy is the most we can do. A democratic socialist says it is the least we can do.  What are you talking about?   1. It's not a rare term. It was a term that was at the fore front of most dominant leftist movements in the 1920s-1950s, especially in the Britian and Germany.   2. It never meant not quite Anarchist but close wtf lmao. Democratic Socialists want a huge state by pure admission.   3. It has never meant a Social Democrat who is more ""passionate"" if you will. It's an entirely different line of philosophy, with entirely different key players, and came BEFORE Social Democracy did. Democratic Socialists believe a lot of things, but the reason they deserve a separate name and distinction is because   i) They were the first to reject and critique Marx's revolutionary Socialism from the Left   ii) They were the first to adopt the idea of Evolutionary Socialism   ii) They encompassed dominant political players from the Fabian Society like Beatrice Webb and her husband.   The list goes on.   What your spouting is a nonsense bastardised version of what Americans consider political science.   &gt;This is clear by Bernie's rhetoric. He himself won't go the extra steps, but he invites people further to the left to build on what he will create. He sees social democracy as a way to encourage the left, rather than satiate it.  Bernie isn't a Democratic Socialist by definition regardless of how much he likes to use to word. He's a Social Democrat. The reason he urges people toward Social Democratic policies is because *he is a Social Democrat*. Why is he a Social Democrat and NOT a Democratic Socialist you ask? Because the latter doesn't would be upset if Capitalism disappeared, and wants the outcome of their ideology to be the eradication of Capitalism. In comparison, a Social Democrat is still a supporter of Capitalism, who believes it needs to be tamed. Bernie is a supporter of Capitalism, and would not like to see it abolished. He is, therefore, not - CANNOT - be a Democratic Socialist."

If you buy a device that has a WiFi connector on it then how do you know that it will work with usb ports on your machine? Because they're certified for that. If devices with the usb sticker stopped working with one another randomly then people would stop trusting the USB  sticker on the devices and would want some other connector and port instead.

MonadTran,2020-01-09 08:33:12,fdmp1ae,t3_em1y3v,t3_em1y3v,"Why would you trust the food in any society?  One piece of information is, reputation. If, over several years, your friends and family have been buying food from a particular place, and none of you got food poisoning, it is an indication this place cares about the quality of their food, and they don't sell garbage to their customers.  Another piece of information is, news. If you're not seeing frequent reports of any food poisoning in any of the news outlets, that means you're living in a high-trust society, and you generally don't have to thoroughly examine the food you're buying. The chance you're going to get poisoned is virtually non-existent - nobody is getting poisoned in this particular place.  Then, there's independent certification. ""But, what if the company certifying the food quality is corrupt?"". Yeah, yeah. There is a chance. That chance is lower than government certification agency being corrupt.  Then, there's visual examination. It's probably a good idea to be looking at the food you're buying. The expiration dates, the absence of mold, the color, the storage conditions.  I was visiting Cyprus the other day. Cyprus is in the EU, it's far from a libertarian paradise. There's a ton of government regulations. None of it prevented one particular store from selling spoiled yogurts. The yogurts were expired, and several had mold on them. Luckily, I examined them myself, noticed the issue, didn't buy them, and didn't get the food poisoning. So if you're in an unfamiliar place, if you're not aware of the reputation of the local stores, not following the local news, not sure who certifies what - do yourself a favor, don't trust anyone, government or no government. Visually examine the food, at least."

masterflappie,2020-01-09 08:57:52,fdmq4w2,t3_em1y3v,t3_em1y3v,"&gt;Food safety is very important, since if it's not watched properly, it will kill you. But in a right-libertarian society (Depending on the system) it doesn't exist.   Food safety will be a concern, it just won't be a concern of the state. Instead of assuming that all food is good (which you showed already fails sometimes), you need to determine how much money you want to pour into food safety. Quality marks will become more useful, as they will show how much effort has been put into food safety.  Not regulating food opens the door for two possible suppliers. One is a large supplier using questionable insecticides and such. You won't be able to trust this food as much as the established suppliers, but they will be much cheaper. This will be especially useful for poor people, right now one of the cheapest food options is fast food, which I'm pretty sure is worse for your body than questionable vegetables and meat.  Another is small scale production, anyone with a backyard or a south facing window can start producing and selling food. You buy a pack of 200 seeds for $2, plant them and a few months later you have vegetables you can sell each vegetable for $1 a piece. Instead of going to the supermarket you might just walk past your neighbor for your food.  This will mean more food production and therefore cheaper food. The poorest in the country will benefit the most from this, as the poverty line essentially gets pushed down. The richest in the country will benefit the least, because they have to think more about what to buy, but the quality marks will take care of that.  &gt;Businesses will cut corners to make a profit or just sell fake food, like how people sold plastic rice in China.   I don't know this story, but I don't think you can bring up China when asking something to right-libertarians. As a business owner, you're gonna want to convince your customers that your food is good or they will move to your competitor. Selling plastic food is economic suicide, so it's a self solving problem.  &gt;This means that you might be eating contaminated meat and meat recalls are common in the US. However, the US has the power to recall all the contaminated food, yet I don't see anyway how recalls would happen in a libertarian society. As they lack the organization and power to do so.  They wouldn't happen. People would hear about bad meat on the market on the news and they get to decide for themselves if they still trust the food they bought. If they're broke, they might want to opt for eating it anyway. Eating bad meat is better than starving.  &gt;I'm sure Right-Libertarians would argue ""the people"" would stop it, which means nothing. As their ideology isn't about the people, but rather the people on top.  One of the biggest reasons why I support removing food regulation is to help the poorest in the country, as I explained above. Your food regulations are good for people who don't have to worry about the price of food. You are the people at the top and you're only looking out for yourself."

""illegalized""? is that even a word?  anyway, again, you can do preemptive measures outlawing drugs also without the many failures of the repressive approach the u.s. has taken.

The reasoning is that education is an investment into the individual and hence the community. It only follows that it more efficient to  get students happily, healthily, quickly and well through education. This is mutually exclusive with the necessity for work. Uni often requires more than 50h a week of work and adding work to that would cut into the quality of the education produced and mental health of the students.      Hence the average life would involve a subsidized housing and a living stipend as well as copiously funded universities. The costs of this are to be amortized long term by the productivity increase of the educated humans produced. This is the short version."

However, if capitalism equals liberty, as you say, then does that assessment not conflict with the fact that Singapore has a harshly authoritarian government that libertarians would find quite oppressive?  for instance, the country banned chewing gum to an extant for a while.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewing_gum_ban_in_Singapore  capital punishment is used for drug possession, prostitution is heavily regulated by the government, the possession of pornography is a crime, as is oral and anal sex between men. THere are laws against ""scandalizing the court"" (criticizing it).   their drug laws are very harsh and clearly show overreach by government:  &gt;Narcotics laws established by the Misuse of Drugs Act are very strict. Anyone caught with more than 15 grams (0.53 oz) of heroin (diamorphine), 30 grams (1.1 oz) of cocaine or morphine, 250 grams (8.8 oz) of methamphetamine, or 500 grams (18 oz) of cannabis faces mandatory capital punishment, as they are deemed to be trafficking in these substances.[25] The stated quantities are the net weight of the substances after they have been isolated by laboratory analysis. Between 1991 and 2004, 400 people were hanged in Singapore, mostly for drug trafficking, one of the highest per-capita execution rates in the world.[14] Persons caught with amounts of controlled substances less than the quantities that would warrant the mandatory death sentence may be spared from the gallows. They may, however, still face harsh penalties ranging from long terms of imprisonment to a maximum of 24 strokes of the cane (for males).  So obviously singapore is an economic hub due it being friendly to business, but is it a country where freedom reigns?"

She might need it to be, if her parents aren't rich enough to pay for her education and her job doesn't cut it either, she'll built up debt.  She would be considered lower income/class until she finishes her education. The lower class does the unskilled job, the more you specialize and fill in a niche, the more you rise in the economic ladder.  Tax is very low, but she has to pay for most of her stuff herself. There's no healthcare for instance, so she has an account with her bank which automatically puts money aside for emergencies.  The cities are more chaotic then you're used to. There's no centralized planning, so no housing zones or the like. It's possible to see a small factory near residentials, but you can also find gardens in the industrial areas. Generally people do stick to the existing zones, because it's easier. Companies naturally want to be close to the harbor, for easier trade. Residents want to be close to the city center. There are no rules on how you should build a house, so on the outskirts of the cities will be some makeshift or DIY housing. You won't find these close to the center because the land becomes to expensive to justify building a DIY house."

In the supplement community it is a constant battle to separate the good from the bad and many people are constantly on forums looking at blood results and talking about how they felt after taking certain supplements.  All over grocery stores there are phrases designed to trick you into thinking they are one thing when they aren’t, for instance no added sugar is often seen but the producers can use concentrates to circumvent this and claim they do not add sugar.   All orange juices are juiced and then left to sit in vats for some amount of time until the juice loses all flavor then the company adds its own flavor powder and this is all you taste. The companies argue it is so their juice is consistent.  All over the grocery store you see things put on labels and not all of those phrases are regulated.

This is why Branding is important and valuable to businesses &amp; consumers.  &gt; Most importantly: Reputation means very little, if anything, compared to price/quality.   Even if I accept your assertion as true for business owners it is not true for consumers. Quality is inherently tied to not killing people and most, maybe not all but most, won't choose to buy from the company that kills 20% of their customers just because they are the cheapest.   &gt; The higher price for ""certified"" goods and services is a middle class privilege at best.   I didn't know Underwriters Lab only served the middle class market!?!   Reduced costs from compliance with government regs would also open up more funds to pay for 3rd party certs without impacting prices (prices would probably go down on average).   It's almost like you have no idea how things work now, much less have thought through how it might work in the future.   &gt; There remains not a single policy or ideal that works against this  singular notion about Right-Libs.

It seems to me like that's exactly what the libertarians are arguing while the socialists are the ones missing the implications. If it's not government vs business, but instead two sides of the same coin, why would we want to give that duo MORE power by giving them the legitimacy of government and the power to ""regulate"" themselves (which is inevitably how the laws are written)? The regulations we end up with are like if a committee of kids got to decide their own punishments instead of leaving it up to individual parents: ""if you stay up past your bedtime playing video games, you don't get to eat your brussels sprouts for a week.""   The reason it will always be this way is that laws on complex subjects NEED to be written by experts. Experts who, *by definition,* are qualified enough to work for the private sector, typically making much more money. So you have to ask yourself, do we really have enough qualified people willing to take a substantial pay cut to take on the difficult job of enforcing ethics? Or will it be the ones who have something to gain?  I work for the government doing quality assurance inspection, and the unfortunate reality is, our job is either really fucking hard if you do it right, or really fucking easy if you're lax in your standards.

There will be a clear economic niche that many people will desire to fill involving the regulation of food products. The people who care about their food being certified with various safety standards will certainly need help in knowing that they can trust the food that they are buying, and so companies will want to buy certifications from various food safety oversight companies. Imagine going to the grocery store, and seeing that your meat was certified as an  ""A"" by some the ""National Food And Safety Corp"" as coming from a facility that met all of their standards for food safety. In earning this rating, they are now allowed to put the ""NFS"" sticker on all of their certified product lines. You as the consumer, can trust that this product was handled with optimal safety standards at least up until it reached a store.  At that point, both the manufacturer who worked to hard to earn that ""A"" rating, and the store selling the product, have an incentive in ensuring that once the product is purchased by the store, that it stays safe. After all, any stories getting out about this ""A grade"" food making people sick will damage the reputation of all 3 corporations, the food and safety oversight corp, the meat production corp, and the grocer themselves.  Generally, this would be solved by grocers also getting certified. Meat vendors, when given the choice, will opt to not sell to uncertified grocers out of fear that they will not be properly represented. They may also charge uncertified grocers more so as to be accommodated for the added risk that an uncertified grocer puts on the vendor.  All of this is to appease the customers who care about food safety.  The other truth, and it is sad, is that most people claim to care about this stuff, but when we look at their actions, they don't really care. Most people claim to want to be healthy, but they sit at home and don't exercise and eat unhealthy food. What people claim to want, and what people actually demonstrate they want with their wallet and actions, are often two very different things. If we lived in a world without government oversight, I would expect oversight companies to exist, and I actually do believe that most of them would do a pretty good job. However, I also think most people simply don't care enough about these standards for it to impact their buying habits. This means that stores would most likely not be loaded up with foods carrying these food and safety labels. Instead, a few products would have them, and the vendors of those products wouldn't have the ability to negotiate with companies to maintain the safety standards after the product was in the hands of the grocer. At the grocery store, you would likely have a small subset of products scattered throughout the store that make it a little more time consuming to find foods that meet your desired standards. Overall, the selection of these products simply wouldn't be great, because most people would rather spend more money on entertainment and luxury items than they would on making sure that their food is safer, especially when they all know about their friend who doesn't pay attentions to those labels at all and is always fine."

But I am not at all concerned about suffering an acute injury do to eating anything, especially if it comes from a company with a recognized brand. Does it still happen? Of course, even with the government regulations you think are magic, but it is not really a concern.   Unhealthy food is an entirely different story, but that is an argument more about how stupid a government should consider their population. Based on regs in the EU they think their population is very stupid.   &gt; It's not ""fraud"", it's just a logo. And even if it was fraud, who's  going to do anything about that? The state? Because of what?  Regulations? Why not regulate the product in the first place then?

At the workplace, where you spend most of your adult life, your muscle and brain power belongs to somebody else. Hence, the product of your labor appears as something alien to you.  &gt;Selling something means you are exchanging its use-value for its exchange-value, and therefore after selling something you can no longer use it.  Therein also lies the difference between concrete labor and abstract labor.  Marx writes in *Captial*:  *On the one hand all labour is, speaking physiologically, an expenditure of human labour power, and in its character of identical abstract human labour, it creates and forms the value of commodities. On the other hand, all labour is the expenditure of human labour power in a special form and with a definite aim, and in this, its character of concrete useful labour, it produces use values.*  In other words, within a commodity quantitative amounts of abstract labor are *reifed* (materialized) in different qualities. Like, in a salami sandwich, there is the labor of the baker and the butcher, but since the butchering and baking are qualitatively different and therefore incomparable, the commodity appears to us as reified abstract human labor, like the total amount of two hours of labor and so on. So you are not only alienated due to the fact that the product of your labor and your labor itself does not belong to you, you're also alienated as your labor only represents abstract components of value.  &gt;I see self ownership as a basis for some ancap or libertarian thinking and it doesn't make sense.  I wouldn't go that far but libertarians are great at naturalizing social constructs, they also do this with stuff like homesteading.´But they never question where these ""rights"" come from. At least enlightenment era liberals were interested where rights come from, which then Hegel debunked in his book about law."

There is all the hope for people who aren't wealthy. Everyone is born broke after all. If an unskilled job doesn't suit you and you want to live a life of luxury, you need to educate yourself. To educate yourself you need money, for money you need to work, which is what my example women is doing.  If you're unable to work for some reason and seeking help with friends and family didn't pay off, you go to charity. People have a lot more money because there is practically no tax, so they have a lot more money to donate. The nice thing is that people now get a choice in what they want to donate to, but more importantly, if they want to donate.   In our current system, even when you're poor you have to donate to charity via tax. If you want to use that money for yourself, it's called tax evasion and you go to jail. In my system, they can use that money to get themselves out of their problems.  Also, if cancer suddenly becomes a much larger problem than poor people, people will switch their donations to cancer because they understand that the biggest problems requires the biggest amount of effort. Collectively we'll build a donation profile that matches our collective concerns.  So then you're going to say that rich people will use all of that money for themselves, which is where you're wrong. Whenever I hear that argument I feel like people are projecting their behaviour onto others. [The richest part of the world made the most donations, fuelled by the richest people.](https://www.csmonitor.com/Business/2018/0613/US-charitable-giving-by-the-wealthy-sets-record-at-more-than-400-billion) People have empathy built into them, you don't have to do that for them. People also have decision making built into them, you don't have to do that for them.  &gt; Rural communities don't even have higher education it must be hell when the soil takes a turn or if they need a doctor.   Yeah it would be nice to have a university next to everyone's house, but that's simply not possible. Rural communities don't need anthropologists, they need bakers and car engineers. You don't teach them that by having a grown up read from a book to children, you send them to a bakery or workshop. If they need a doctor, they drive to the nearest doctor. If that doctor is far away, someone in the community will become a doctor. If they become big enough to justify having higher education, then someone will build a school. Schools are privatised after all.  &gt; Your student is both working and incurring debt you could have at least offered a little hope here but nope.   She *might* get debt. School will be privatised so they will be a lot cheaper, but if all cards are stacked against you, yes you might get a debt. That doesn't mean that there's no hope and you're going to die, it means that for a while every month she loses a bit of her salary. I've gone to college while working while building up debt and I got rid of my debt within a year.  &gt; Your vision seems to be a society that's worse off than many third world countries but at least there doesn't seem to be a war impacting your students decisions.   My vision is a society where people are free to live as they choose to live, without tyrants and self-righteous people forcing you to live as they want to at the threat of violence."

Are you just pretending that's not an issue?  &gt; Does it still happen? Of course, even with the government regulations you think are magic, but it is not really a concern.   Does it happen less than without regulations? that's the real question.  &gt; Unhealthy food is an entirely different story, but that is an argument more about how stupid a government should consider their population. Based on regs in the EU they think their population is very stupid.   Not at all. In fact it's usually the population that requests those high standards and regulations. Because we want quality food and know that it takes equipment, time and resources that we can't individually afford to ensure food safety.  &gt; Did you not understand that all 3 things could, and probably would, happen not just one you don't like? Does the EU not have product insurance available for companies there?   They sure as hell don't advertise it. Because they don't want us to think they'd even need it. Obviously. What they do advertise is the labels of quality issued from our regulations, like protected origins denomination and so forth. Or the lack of specific ingredients.  &gt; Everything I wrote is happening to some extent now, I wrote the basic stuff, it is just being done around the broken and corrupt government monopoly on regulations.   and yet you end up with sawdust in the food market, thus proving that all those aren't solutions. at all."

I think capitalism needs government regulation and guidance to flourish. I only responded because I felt that I could adequately answer your question, and I think that I can take a stab at this one too.   &gt;And even now where this kind of solution is readily available no firm is doing that.  Sorry, but I just want to clarify, as you claiming that we could have third party QA regulators but don't? Because if that is what you are claiming, [we certainly do have third party regulators, even with things like food safety](https://www.careersinfood.com/food-safety-consultants-resource-61.htm). I'm not aware of them putting their emblems on food packages, but it wouldn't surprise me if we found their seals of approvals on some items. I think it's worth considering that government mandates on food safety have made the importance of private certifications less valuable than they would be if the government wasn't involved. Though personally, I wouldn't expect private certifications to be crazy popular even if the government didn't have a hand in food safety, but that's just my personal opinion.  &gt; What makes you think that they'd start spending on certification when you remove the flimsy checks that are there now?  Well, I do think there would be a market of people who would really be interested and would shop for certifications, and so I do think without a government involved, the value of private certifications would increase and naturally be more visible than they are now (they're practically invisible now). I don't know if a sticker emblem would always be the solution, we might also expect a variety of other things, such as grocers getting certified as a whole, and part of their certification might be ensuring that their vendors meet certain quality standards. It's probably wrong of us to focus on just a single solution and say ""oh yes, that's what everyone would switch too"".  However, personally, I think that most people simply would rather spend less money on food, and more money on entertainment and luxury items. So if the government really were to drop out of food safety, we would see food safety quality go down, and people would die, but not to the point where people would radically change their habits. Most people would shop the same way they do now, but maybe avoid certain products for a while if they hear negative health related stories about them (like people did when they avoided Chipotle). I would expect that you'd see more effort put into certifying food, but not so much that it would radically change any of our shopping experiences. The few people who care a lot about food safety will probably have to resort to shopping at smaller specialty stores that specifically seek out the products with the highest food safety ratings, or sort of nit pick through the isles of bigger stores that have safer products all over, in much the same way that people looking for organic food had to shop today."

Taking your numbers, this would equal 80+h/week which is not healthy or sustainable and right up destructive to the vast majority (arguably all) of youths. Jobs can and should be implemented in the context of university (summers, work semesters etc.) in order to maximize the personal and societal benefits.   Working at McDonald's for instance is a loss for everybody save McDonald's: Flooding of the low wage labour market depressing wages for the students and, more importantly, wider unskilled labour. Students are effective not operating efficiently even in the context of work, the value created by a student at McDonald's is a mere fraction of what they could produce. They don't learn all the relevant skills they will need in a intellectually more demanding sector. etc. All in all I see the obligation to work during lecture and exam times as purely detrimental. Work outside of it can be very beneficial.   And to clear, we are talking about university students here, certain things are minimaly different for applied universities or higher trade schools.   Paradoxically, work doesn't cut into partying. Students with slightly more time on their hands are more likely to find hobbies and follow additional interests which are very positively correlated to innovation. Students on the other end are more likely to lash out, binge drink and the like. And I wish to add that a good social life is vital for a healthy life."

No it doesn't, in fact it has a vested interested in *not* educating people, because educated people question the absurd claims of politicians promising, say, free everything for everyone forever, and the people who actually *acquire power* under a democracy have every incentive to ensure that voters are dependent and not terribly educated - thus solidifying their base of power and securing their electoral base.  &gt;The reason why people are told politics is a taboo, reason is bad and emotions are everything... is because of capitalism, barring access to education and brainwashing the masses with advertising propaganda and fake news.  No. Capitalism may rely on fundamentally unethical premises, but it doesn't follow that everything bad is because of capitalism. Politics is a shitshow because it's centralized power.  Centralized power that socialists conveniently ignore while decrying almost every other form of centralized power, but centralized power nonetheless - and democracies are inherently both anti-individualist and pro-collectivist. Individual rights are consistently sacrificed on the altar of *The Greater Good* in a democracy. When you can vote (for free) to steal from Peter to pay Paul, and you're a Paul... why wouldn't you?  You would, because incentives. And that's why politics sucks. Democracy isn't meritorious. It's two wolves and a sheep deciding what's for dinner.  &gt;So why throw out democracy, if the real issue is capitalism?  I don't think we should throw out democracy. I just don't think it should be the deciding force, writ large, in society. I *also* don't think we should throw out capitalism - I think *some* private ownership and control of business is 100% ethical and justifiable.

I also own a food store that makes cheaper and cheaper ""innovations"" to keep my co-owners profitable. These 2 assets are part of the same conglomerate, called ""Business-Food-Corp"".  I don’t care. What I do care about is how you got the money to own the assets or how you and your co owners keep running. If the answer is money, where did you get it from?  &gt; Thus, if my warehouse generates the majority of the income through my competitors' contracting gigs, I can play ""fast and loose"" with my own food storage restraints. If one of my customers gets Taenia (From my storefront), ""They can simply shop at my competitors anyway"", where I provide more adequate refrigeration.  So from this we can establish the following:  That you still survive of customers money. That you don’t use proper refrigeration(?) so government regulators make no difference.  You clearly aren’t killing your customers, and hopefully do not intend to do this is not the same as what we are talking about.  And finally you are hoping (I use the word hoping as I’m 100% sure the scenario you’ve described has never happened) that customers will not become wise to how your conglomerate works or that you business partners won’t care you are gaming their customers.  Dude you are either a liar, a bad person or you are likely not helping yourself.  Plus this whole business model/ scenario is based on the fact your competitors actually take care of their food. So this separate hypothetical scenario we’ve been discussing where loads of businesses poison customers, is not supported by your own.  &gt; superfluous.

First example: Do you think that people, in general or in any significant number at all, are for or against sweatshops? Not are *you* for or against them because we already know that most neoliberals are very much in favor of voluntary slave labor; that's a whole other subject.

Even though I don’t believe in what your telling me for several reasons. 5 people apparently died, regardless of what shit you will pull out your arse next, those government regulations that were meant to protect those people didn’t work. Not to mention the reason you are still in business is because your competitors don’t kill customers. So you’ve just proved my point with your BS scenario.  Thank you"

This is often an occourence when we're talking about food for example, and it's the reason why agriculture in developed countries is subsidized.  It also depends a lot on the disposable income of the population, if the population has a lot of disposable income then the population can choose freely between a cheap but unsure product and a costly but safe product, if instead the general population doesn't have that disposable income but the disposable income is in the hands of few rich people, then the quality, overall, will go down.

This presumes that socialist value definitions are valid, and that's shaky ground to start with. Let's look at some fundamentals of what you're asking...  What we call ownership is based on our modern concept of private property, which itself came about very recently. The idea that someone can ""own"" an object even when they're not around to defend that ownership developed slowly over the past two millennia. Even up until the 19th or even the early 20th century, many tribal civilizations such as the American natives, Australian aborigines, and Asiatic steppe tribes practiced very limited ideas of ownership - one could only own what they could carry. If they dropped a hat and someone else picked it up, ownership of the hat was transferred.  That early concept of ownership had some curious consequences - many modern educators in the US enjoy pointing out that women in many native tribes [owned the homes and everything inside them](https://www.ducksters.com/history/native_americans/roles_of_women_and_men.php) \- they often interpret this as an early form of female empowerment. While that's a satisfying interpretation for progressives, it's more generally a direct consequence of limits of the concept of ownership in their culture. The men who did the hunting, fishing, building, and warring were often away from the home for extended periods. The women were the ones who maintained a presence in the home, thus making it ""theirs"", because they were the ones who kept an eye on all of their possessions.  Of course, this description is over-simplified - native cultures were extremely varied in their individual practices, but the consequences of property norms were very consistent across cultures. In nomadic tribes, property concepts were strictly limited by what could be carried at all times. Among migrating tribes like the Sioux or Apache, the concept of theft was almost completely foreign, because if you lost something, it was no longer yours. If someone took something directly from you by force, then they won possession from you legitimately.  Conversely, tribes which were agriculturally focused had much stronger concepts of property - Pueblos could leave their homes and possessions inside unattended and come back expecting that nobody had taken anything without permission. Iroquois rotated between homes based on seasonal changes in the best hunting/fishing/agricultural areas, and maintained ownership of dwellings despite being away for weeks or months at a time. Iroquois culture offers an excellent example of what many socialists/communists idealize as the balance between communal and personal property - they had strong concepts of personal property, but land, harvests, and catches/game were communal.  The same tendency exists among tribal peoples in other areas - among both austral aboriginal tribes and asiatic steppe tribes, nomadic tribes had very limited and weak concepts of ownership, while strongly agricultural tribes had more expansive and stronger concepts of ownership.  Today, in our modern capitalist culture, private property has become a very strong concept, and ownership of property cannot be transferred except by voluntary exchange of goods or money. For small purchases, this isn't really important, but once you get into more expensive items, then it become increasingly complex. Land titles, recording offices, liens, contracts, corporate filings, conveyance, deeds... a whole slew of legal methods and practices for ensuring the ownership and valid transfer of ownership has sprung up among high-value property, whether it's real estate, art, cars, jewelry, etc. Even if possession of that property is lost by force or graft, then transfer of ownership is not recognized, and the state is charged with making reasonable efforts to remedy the situation.  Of course, socialists and communists disagree with this sort of ownership, and prefer limiting property ownership to ""personal property"" - items which you use day-in-day out in your normal course of life.  &amp;#x200B;  To summarize - to ""own"" something is an idea that has developed culturally over the centuries, and it's not a universally agreed upon concept. ""Ownership"" is not a mathematical definition that one can plug into a boolean logic system and come out on the other side with a ""correct"" answer, which is what you're trying to do in your post.  You can't own another person because we, as a culture, have almost universally decided over the past century that it's not a valid type of ownership. We tried it, it turned out kinda ugly, we ain't going back to it.  Right now, bodily autonomy is still being hashed out legally - in the EU, you can't sell a kidney, but in Iran, you can. You can buy a [liver or a heart in China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_trade#China), but you can't sell one. In the US, you can't sell an organ, but you can donate it.  So... do you ""own"" yourself? Well... it depends on how you think of ownership.  To ancaps/libertarians, it's not even a valid question - autonomy is a requirement for ownership, but ownership only applies to property external to self, and it's a concept used for the consumption, use, or exchange of that property. Self is not a thing that can be exchanged or consumed, so it's not an entity that is subject to ""ownership""."

Capitalism allows for buyouts to happen at really large scales (tens of thousands of people report to the 3 members of the Walton Family for example).

Self ownership is base of libertarianism.

Is it human nature to want recourse if harmed?    Yes.   My list, which is basic stuff so not complete, covers all of that.

With their productivity increased by automation they might be able to produce 100/hour and so I would like many more workers.

Ok, going to try to be gentle with you here.  I'm starting with this quote from you, because you are blatantly mistaken here, and it's not worth continuing if you don't recognize your mistake. It's pretty critical for understanding how my previous post addresses yours.  **Communism and socialism both make a important (to them) distinction between** [**personal and private property**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_property#Personal_versus_private_property)**:**  From the Communist Manifesto:  &gt;[In this sense, the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: Abolition of private property! ... When, therefore, capital is converted into common property, into the property of all members of society, personal property is not thereby transformed into social property.](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch02.htm)  The manifesto actually claims to defend personal property, and accuses capitalists of being the ones seeking to steal/accumulate it all:  &gt;We Communists have been reproached with the desire of abolishing the right of personally acquiring property as the fruit of a man’s own labour, which property is alleged to be the groundwork of all personal freedom, activity and independence.   &gt;   &gt;Hard-won, self-acquired, self-earned property! Do you mean the property of petty artisan and of the small peasant, a form of property that preceded the bourgeois form? There is no need to abolish that; the development of industry has to a great extent already destroyed it, and is still destroying it daily.   &gt;   &gt;Or do you mean the modern bourgeois private property?  Marx himself was at pains to [define private property](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch32.htm) strictly as property which is used socially to generate profit (means of production), yet from which the profits are not fully socially distributed. Friedrich Engels also made the point that ""private"" property was not the everyday possessions which all people own, but only the productive property that was in the hands of the capitalist class:  &gt;[You are horrified at our intending to do away with private property. But in your existing society, private property is already done away with for nine tenths of the population; its existence for the few is solely due to its non-existence in the hands of those nine tenths.](https://spartacus-educational.com/TUengels.htm)  Marx and Engels did not generally label common possessions ""personal"" property, but they would refer to it as ""individual"" or ""common"", or whatever the german equivalent is. Regardless, they did not seek to [abolish all property](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/01/karl-marx-engels-capitalism-political-economy), only private property, aka, the means of production.  Modern parlance has deemed this the personal/private property distinction, and there are a [huge number of explanations about it online](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=private+property+vs+personal+property).  \-----  Still with me?  Ok... let's move on.  &gt;So use value and exchange value are not real? Things don't have value in use, things don't have value in exchange?  That's correct. Marx's version of the LTV sought to create a theory that explained the ""natural"" value of objects. His LTV created a menagerie of value-types to explain the structure of trade, but it still failed the same way all other value theories did - it could not address the subjective and dynamic nature of value. Fundamentally, this is because value is not a thing, but an action - one that is performed by everyone thousands of times a day. It had some superficial success explaining the tendency of prices to asymptotically approach the total labor cost involved in production, but that same phenomena is explained more elegantly by capitalist cost-accounting, and Marxist LTV fails in many areas (such as emerging markets and non-commoditized products) where modern cost-accounting succeeds.  To put it briefly: value does not exist, because it is not a thing. It is an act, a personal evaluation. Asking what the correct ""value"" of something is equivalent to asking what the correct ""opinion"" of something is.  \-----  &gt;So...if we decided it was okay we could own people? What are you talking about?  Did you miss the last four or five millennia of human history? Slavery was around for faaaaaarrrr longer than it's been abolished. It wasn't until [1981 that the last country finally abolished it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery). Historically, people decided it was ok to own people, so they did. We now disagree with that, and now we do not allow it.  Again, this is not a debatable opinion, this is stark historical **fact**.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;And yet nowhere can you sell yourself. Do you want to try actually engaging with the substance of my argument?  Kettle, pot, pot kettle.  The substance of your argument appears to be that ancap/libertarian positions are based on self-ownership, so that should allow selling oneself into slavery.  My response, as I've laid out in length, is that words and expressions such as ""property"", ""exchange"", ""ownership"", etc., are not static concepts, they have been developing for centuries, and they have very different meanings in different contexts.  You are taking words from a socialist context and then trying to apply to them to libertarian/ancap thinking without addressing the fact that they mean something very different in that context, and they have different foundations for understanding ownership, property, and self - consequently the conclusions that you draw from your socialist context don't properly apply.  Asking a libertarian/ancap if you can sell yourself is like asking if red can be blue, or if water can be dry. The question itself is meaningless because it ignores what the words mean."

However, as was already pointed out by the [PM of Denmark](https://www.thelocal.dk/20151101/danish-pm-in-us-denmark-is-not-socialist), those countries aren't actually socialistic, they have market economies with social programs.  That being said, social democracy isn't my favorite political philosophy but I think it is not too bad when compared to other models. I'm mainly a little unsure about the long term stability of such societies.  Some benefits are obviously:  * Wealth distribution, leading to;    * Equal opportunities.    * less crime.    * Increased social stability.  The main problems are:  * They're prone to being taken advantage off;    * It's not just the capitalists that are greedy, all people have those abilities and the option of getting free money is very attractive, resulting in either a lot of costs for the social programs or a lot of bureaucracy to keep out the freeloaders. Either way, it's expensive.  * High living costs;     * Due to high taxes, although they may be compensated some of the time by things like health care but that mostly depends on circumstances of each individual. The more people have trouble, the more they get compensated, which unfortunately is not always a recipe for good behavior. * Poor economic efficiency.    * Slightly due to wealth distribution but mostly due to heavily interfering and regulating markets like housing.

If they hunt you down and kidnap you, they're committing a crime. Maybe they could sue you for the cost of your last meal, or keep your deposit for board, but other than that they have no legal recourse.   This bit is false. If you sold yourself into slavery (which would be entirely possible in a hypothetical Ancap society) then the person who now owns you *would not* be committing a crime if they hunted you down for trying to escape. In fact, any authorities would be legally compelled to return you to your master's possession if they found you.  Legally it would basically be you waiving all your human rights away, which is entirely possible in a society with no government to enforce said rights. You would be property, and therefore:  \-Your master could harm you as much as they wanted, up to and including killing you, as they own you  \-Violence against you would legally be property damage, not assault  \-Anyone trying to free you would be committing theft  Etc.

Other companies have near infinite ability to then pressure those third-party agencies (if they don’t already control them by proxy) to give me bad ratings, deny me the seal of quality, etc.  The reputable and well known agencies are going to charge more for me to use their service, because of their brand, and can extort literally any price they want on me- I have to go through them to sell in any meaningful amount.

Other people might take offense to slavery, yes, but in the absence of laws against slavery (which would not exist without government), said people *would be violating the NAP* if they tried to free your slave.

Phanes7,2020-01-10 02:40:31,fdpatwa,t3_em1y3v,t1_fdowuhf,"That makes it clearer as to what you meant but you are making some assumptions that are not true either in theory nor in practice. I'll try to brake it down for you using real world examples:   &gt; Every major company I’m competing with has in-house certification teams,  or have the leverage to get favorable deals with certification  agencies. I’m stuck paying a nice premium, simply because I’m a small  fella.   This actual situation exists in the here and now, I deal with it personally with Organic certification but a more applicable example is outside the food realm with Underwriters Lab. Go look on anything around you that plugs into the wall, odds are it has a UL number on it. UL is a highly respected agency that has been so successful at what they do that they are pretty much ubiquitous. Your concern simply has not happened. The company I used to work for was pretty small at the time and we got UL certs with no issues and for very reasonable prices (Organic certification works the same, even though that is a bit different)  &gt; Other companies have near infinite ability to then pressure those  third-party agencies (if they don’t already control them by proxy) to  give me bad ratings, deny me the seal of quality, etc.   Not at all. Customers are the ones with ""near infinite ability"" as when it is discovered that cert agency X is pandering to Dole they quickly lose all legitimacy and get replaced in the market. Dole also suffers an even bigger loss for being duplicitous on top of having unsafe food. This happens now but the effects are blunted because companies usually meet stupid government regulations so nothing much happens to them.   &gt; The reputable and well known agencies are going to charge more for me to  use their service, because of their brand, and can extort literally any  price they want on me- I have to go through them to sell in any  meaningful amount.   Doesn't actually happen as I discussed above.   &gt; Now I have to deal with advertising. Again, because big companies have  the weight to throw around, they can twist the arm of the reg agency to  sing their praises as lousy as possible. Think the junk food industry  pro-sugar lobbying, amplified by 1000x.   Competing with big company ad budgets is hard (I know this first hand) but doable (ditto) everything else happens now anyways. The assumption that pro-industry front organizations would get 1000x worse is a questionable assumption. People would actually have to care where there info is coming from, no FDA compliance to go by and pretend is good enough, so I think that issue would improve not get worse.   &gt; Okay, so I’m finally through all that.  But wait a minute, because consumers now have to trust the **company**  to not sell them poison food, they’re going to gravitate towards large  and well-established name brands, who in their mind must be trustworthy  because everyone else trusts them as well, right? So when they see some  random brand of juice that I’m selling, probably without all of the  premium certification packages that other companies afford, they’re  going to pass and opt instead for the safer pick.   That is how it works now. Welcome to the business world.   &gt; And guess what- even if I become successful, I’ll just be bought out  lock stock and barrel. I’ll be undercut as nauseous until yet another  competitor goes out of business and is bought.   If you sell. It's not like you have to sell. That's up to you.  The reality is that your concerns, while not silly or unjustified, are questionable at the theoretical level and demonstrably untrue the what-is-actually-happening level. While nothing is perfect I will happily put the various private certification companies up against their government counter parts and we can see what is more co-opted."

See in this scenario, nobody would care what happens, because where it sucks to not have a place to live, if your choices are live in peace with your neighbors or constantly following your passion for pedophilia, if you pick swiping right for boyscouts, it’s kind of on you and not the landlord.

It’s like people who say “USSR wasn’t socialist” just because they don’t like that particular flavor of socialism.   There's literally only 1 form of capitalism, anything else is just an alteration.   &gt;And there is a place where companies run the government. There’s a province of a Central American country (I can’t remember if it’s Honduras or Guatemala) where companies run the area.

Because they can buy cheaper food that is also safe elsewhere, which essentially ruins your argument:  It isn't expensive to reliably produce food that is safe and of decent quality.  Without regulatory hurdles and and other such market interventions, it can be even cheaper to produce quality food.  Sure some store could sell rotten food for pennies, but that doesn't mean that a poor person can't find a safe affordable alternative.  Consider a region in which the only grocers sell poor quality bottom of the barrel food.  Any intelligent businessman will open up a store there, build a brand of affordable quality food, and take all of the business in that area thus destroying the profitability of the original businesses.  So that takes us back to the original question: why would a brand-name business not screen their food supply to ensure quality and customer satisfaction?"

The influencing of politicians by corporations means you already do not have unregulated capitalism. Large corporations don't influence politicians to make the markets less unregulated, they do it make it more regulated. It's game theory - they have more to gain by losing some to regulation than to lose to infinite competition. The best strategy in a marketplace where the government is purchasable, is to influence it to gain a comparative advantage.

We aren't ""trying it one more time"" the current JÖK government is still cutting back on taxes and the state in general. This has been ongoing ever since the assassination of Olof Palme in 1986 - the last truly left-wing SAP party leader to be in power.  Even the Left Party is arguably more economically right-wing today than the Social Democrats were in the 1970s. Welfare costs a lot and people tend to forget but the general tax pressure during the Swedish Folkhem was much higher than it is today. You can't have the cake and eat it at the same time.  At the same time identity issues divide the populace and work against the political altruism that brought the SAP into power in the first place, with workers now preferring to vote conservative/nationalist in opposition to the middle class pandering diversity policies.  A quick glance at [GDP over time](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/SWE/sweden/economic-growth-rate) does suggest that growth rates were somewhat weaker during the pre-90s era, but overall it seems like business cycles are to blame for most drops in economic growth.  [Looking at the national debt over time](https://tradingeconomics.com/sweden/government-debt), it again seems like the early Social Democracy was relatively stable with the decifit only rising after the '76 right-wing government and plateauing during the '82-'86 SAP government.  [However, spending relative to GDP](https://tradingeconomics.com/sweden/government-spending-to-gdp) has consistently fallen since the mid-90's (Possibly even earlier than that) which reinforces my point about the consistent shifting to the right of Swedish economics.  There is little that actually suggests that Social Democracy is to blame for the general state of disarray in Sweden - privatization and defunding of welfare combined with immigration of populations unsuited to the Swedish labour market are much more correlatable with it."

What happens when all your steel is produced somewhere else?  What happens when all your food is produced somewhere else?  What happens when all your cars are produced somewhere else?  First thing first you won't have control over that sectors, other states will have it, your only control will be based on the fact that you can or cannot wage a war against those countries. What if your food  sources are completely cut because most of the countries that give you food decide to embargo you? Will you be able to feed your population and your military? What if you don't have steel to produce your weapons? What if you don't know the technology to build the cars that you drive and then that technology is fundamental for something else entirely, a new market sector?  There is a trade off when you delocalize your production, you lose, in the short run, the people that can do that production and in the long run the ability to be competitive on the market because then you'll lack the knowhow to do it. In addition to that you can't control how the food is produced in an external country, what if they sell you food that is affected by something unknown to you and they do it on purpose (but in secret from you), what if, for example, they use water mixed to oil to irrigate the fields and sell you that food (while they keep the one irrigated with normal water)?  What if the internal production is profitable and give jobs to a lot of people but need an investment upfront or is periodically subject to shortages / market fluctuations that can be mitigated only by a state? Otherwise the sector will become completely abandoned?  There are many factors for which keeping internal production is the best decision, and that's what China for example did for a long time (and still does), and that's what permits China, right now, to compete on the global scale with the USA hegemony, even if the USA economy were a lot bigger than China economy 40-50 years ago (it still is, but a lot less)"

You don't need to rely on the highest paid person in the office, you rely on people who have empathy and wealth to share. That's not just one person, that's millions and millions of people. Out of these millions of people, some of them will be incredibly rich and they will help the most people.   And it's also not true that you need to appeal to these people if you want something, this is what I meant with not engaging with my rebuttal. I listed reasons why it becomes much easier to get things yourself so you don't have to rely on others, like poor people paying practically no tax and donations more closely resembling the problems people face. If you think that wouldn't work, give some arguments as to why. Don't just call it stupid and leave it at that.  And if you think that appealing to the richest is a dumb way of asking for help, you know who the richest entity in the entire nation is? The government. So how do we get help if help is managed via tax? By appealing to the richest.  &gt;Nope just a set of factual statements. It's not even an argument.  Okay, I agree with those facts. I guess then I don't understand why you responded it when I said that having a lot of universities is a good thing.  &gt;Then you need to work on your creative writing skills.  I'll work on that, and I'll ask you to work on your presumptuousness.  &gt;No, private schools are more expensive because they rarely achieve a size that allows them to gain from eccomies of scale and ultimately have higher costs of doing business. Then when we factor in the profit motive their cost climbs yet again. Public schooling is far more efficient and effective.  They're small because the upper class is a minority. If you're going to compare them to the institutions who cater to the masses, of course they are going to be smaller and more costly, they cater to a smaller group of people with more money. Or they cater to a specific religious group, which means that also cater to a smaller target audience while providing more services which require money.  Public schooling also have a profit motive, but in a twisted way. Their job is to make sure that they spend at least the same amount as last year, preferably more. If they don't, they lose subsidies. So public schools spent money on dumb shit like getting new chairs and desks just to make sure they spend enough money. In my school life, I've seen this happen 3 times. Because they spend money on dumb shit, we see the cost of education go up, to which we respond by increasing subsidies. Schools once again respond by buying even more dumb shit and we respond by increasing subsidies. The only one who benefits here is the government as it gives itself the right to collect more and more taxes. If a private school starts buying dumb shit, they go broke. They also need to get that money from parents, by convincing parents that they're better than their competitors, by actually being better. Public schools don't try to improve themselves because they'll get money anyway. That's why it's good for schools to have a profit motive.   &gt;It only takes 1 person to act like a tyrant to cause significant harm. Even if we had 1/100th of a percent of ""rich"" people who were ""evil"" we'd still have hundreds of tyrants running around wreaking havoc all over your society.  Exactly, so let's not give them a massive government which they can take over. If I have rights and Jeff Bezos wants to hurt me, what's he going to do? Send me an email calling me a faggot?"

Ok so you don't understand people can differ on what rights can be included in this? I feel bad for you that this needs explaining. Every right, when protected, interferes with someone.

It would take years for him to sell it, and as he did it would destroy investor confidence and tank the stock price.   What’s worse, his gross income is only a few million a year.

Public schools are able to use other government programs to administer their students and provide feedback on their curriculum. When education isn't a competitive business there's a great deal more than can be achieved.   &gt;Public schooling also have a profit motive, but in a twisted way. Their job is to make sure that they spend at least the same amount as last year, preferably more. If they don't, they lose subsidies. So public schools spent money on dumb shit like getting new chairs and desks just to make sure they spend enough money.

Marx pointed out that “production of surplus value is the absolute law” of the capitalist mode of production (K. Marx and F. Engels, Soch., 5th ed., vol. 23, p. 632). This law reflects not only the economic relations between capitalists and wage workers but also the economic relations between various groups of the bourgeoisie— industrialists, merchants, and bankers— and between them and the landowners. The pursuit of surplus value plays the chief role in the development of the productive forces under capitalism and determines and channels the development of production relations in capitalist society. **The doctrine of surplus value, which Lenin called “the cornerstone of Marx’ economic theory”** (Poln. sobr. soch., 5th ed., vol. 23, p.45), was first elaborated by Marx in 1857-58 in the manuscript of “A Critique of Political Economy” (the first draft of Das Kapital)."

The problem is that you felt the need to proclaim that it was because she was a woman.   &gt;You know where the governments gets the money to pay for that school?  Taxes provide a plethora of services that lower costs all across the economy. Taxes also have a huge advantage in their monopolistic power to alter their cost based on individual income. Low and middle income individuals benefit significantly from taxes and how our governments use them. Conservative propaganda has been effective in spreading a false narrative about taxes while shifting the tax burden down onto middle and low income individuals.   &gt;This is appealing to everyone above the poverty line.  So taxes through begging?   &gt;why not support creating monopolies for everything?  Sure, so long as they're socially owned that would adequate.  &gt;Name a few and tell my why liberal capitalism isn't helping.  Liberal capitalism is the system we have and that you're complaining about. All of the problems you raised stem directly from treating public schools like businesses in their accounting and financial departments. When we recognize that education is a public good and treat our schools as investments in the society we release them from the burden of the profit motive.   &gt;Do you honestly believe that government and capitalism is the same? Have you not noticed the amount of ancaps here?  Our current governments are Capitalist governments. Ancaps just want to be in charge and recognize that they'll never be able to do that with the current systems. They'll install their own version of a government pretty quick if they ever topple the current government. Even AnSocs would install a form of government. Anarchists have very little credibility in their counter-government philosophies.   &gt;Stop evading the question. If Bezos wants to hurt me, what will he do that is also legal?  &gt;I also never said that there was no government support. There's a constitution and a police force enforcing the constitution.  Bezos would just pay his way around the law. We already have repeat manslaughters who are free because they have enough money to avoid jail.

Here are a few off the top of my head:   1. What value to do you tax? Property tax is pretty simple. It is taxed at an assessed value and rather than market value (in my area at least). This means there are two values. One is steady to and avoid market fluctuations. Would we have to do the same with stocks? Those can fluctuate quite a bit.  2. Is the redistribution as fair as property tax? Property tax is local and the revenue is used locally. At least this gets reinvested near the property owner for services he/she can use or see. Would this be the same with a net worth tax? Would we tax net worth in Alabama to fund a bridge in Alaska?  3. Would investors flee US investments? Because property tax has a physical presence, we can easily divide the line between what is taxed and what isn't. For example, would we tax only US stocks? Is foreign stock untaxed in the same way that foreign  property is not taxed by the US (at least I think it is not taxed)? This could cause money to chase foreign investments rather US companies. I don't see the same problem with property tax."

Choose one.  I already explained that my belief is that women and men tend to make different choices which aren't reflected by our current system, so in my explanation of how I envision things I reflected this. I've even given  sources explaining what I base that belief on. Yet the only thing I keep hearing from you is that I shouldn't do this, with no argumentation given. Why am I not allowed to think that women tend to make different choices and reflect that in how I envision a good world?  You said that I could've used her characteristics instead. Isn't that the same? Not everyone with the same character traits behave the same, wouldn't I be crossing the same line that I'm crossing now? Why is it okay to generalize character traits but not gender?  If I had wrote this out as a guy who became a coal miner, you wouldn't have called it sexist. But when I say that she becomes a secretary, that crosses your dogma. I'm not going to listen to dogmatic, arbitrary demands on how I should view the world. I'd love to debate them out, but that requires some argumentation from your side. I've explained why and how I view this issue. Can you get any further than ""well that's wrong""?  &gt;Taxes provide a plethora of services that lower costs all across the economy.  So the school that takes 5k to run suddenly only requires 4k when the government pays for it? Socialist propaganda has been effective in spreading a false narrative about taxes while shifting the tax burden down onto middle and low income individuals.  &gt;So taxes through begging?  No taxes through anything. Getting help by requesting it. Not forcing people to pay for something only you care about under the pretense of empathy.  You know, it used to be the church who took care of the sick. Whenever the amount of sick people would grow past a certain point, people would naturally go to the church to help out the large amount of sick people. Empathy doesn't have to be enforced, it's built into us.  Then we had a separation of church and state, which was great, because asking the state for communal support was recognized as a conflict of interests. Now that religion has pretty much fallen, we've recombined church and state again. People are once again willing to use the states force to impose their dogma onto everyone else, serving only the majority and oppressing the minority.  If you feel like this issue is close to your heart, why don't you go *do* something? It's easy to pass that responsibility to the state, you won't have to do anything and it makes you look virtuous, but you have no clue as to the amount of people struggling under the weight of tax already.  &gt;Sure, so long as they're socially owned that would adequate.  This. Exactly this. If a majority of people support it and a minority doesn't, we don't care about the minority. You sound like a christian voting on a hijab ban.

What you can't do is force the population to join your system. If people want to live without a system and outside help, they should be able to. The only rules your system has to follow is the constitution, you can be in charge of everything else.  &gt;Bezos would just pay his way around the law.   If you don't trust the government to enforce the law, which I can understand, in my system you could get some mercenaries to enforce the law for you. So long as my mercenaries can prove that Bezos acted aggressively to me, the state cannot prosecute me for having Bezos arrested.  &gt;We already have repeat manslaughters who are free because they have enough money to avoid jail.

Agreed, but the issue is that the overwhelming majority simply don't care about the superior standard. In other words, it's not important to most people. For example, I don't really give a fuck if the grocery store can track the ground beef I bought back to the specific cow that it was made out of, especially given that their ability to track it back to a specific cow doesn't help prevent me from getting sick, and if it costs me a few cents more to have that ""perk"". Is it a superior standard? Sure! The ability to track your meat from farm to shelf is important to some people, but not to everyone, and not to me. Some people will pay a few extra cents for that standard, but I and most others will not.  &gt;So the distributor? Same as before, why aren't they doing so already? How come usa ended up with sawdust in the food?  Because most people don't really care, and would rather pay more for entertainment and luxuries and less for their food. They don't care about higher food standards if it means paying more for the food.  You're confusing some people caring a lot about this stuff, with the majority who really doesn't understand or care about any of it.  &gt;Therefore government involvement is necessary.

It's one of the most barbaric taxes in existence right after income tax.   Income tax: the government owns your income and allows you to keep a % of it. If 100% of the product of your labor is taken from you, that's slavery. At what % is it no longer slavery? Don't forget that slaves were provided food and housing too.   Property taxes: The government owns your land and house and you have to pay rent to the government for its use. You do not own it. It's akin to a mobster coming down to you place saying ""You gotaltta stuff here. It'd be a shame if something bad happens to it...""   &gt;if a billionaire has to pay 1% of his net worth in taxes?   1% of a billion is 10 million. A billionaire does not have 10 million in cash sitting around in a bank vault. The billionaire would have to sell assets to send this amount to the government. I'd rather those assets continue to produce value for the economy than for them to be used to create another bomb for the MIC to blow up, or whatever else government is trying to do. Also still stealing so there's that."

We tolerate the property tax because they are usually hidden in the escrow portion of your mortgage payment (out of sight out of mind) and that they are based on a relatively stable slowiy increasing value that is way under the market value of the house.  It helps that they typically go to things like schools, police, fire departments, and local public works projects and increases are put up for a vote.  I do agree that taxes on people that are wealthy enough to live on investments (includes the likes of Bezos, Gates, and Buffett) are too low but a wealth tax is the wrong way to do it. Many equities do not pay dividends so to pay a wealth tax the holder has to sell the asset, this is unfair.  Imagine you had a rare tea set you inherited from you grandmother, she is gone and the set is the only thing you have to remember her by...  maybe there are 10 just like it in the world and they are highly prized by collectors and sell for hundreds millions.  You have no desire to sell yours because of sentimental reasons but because other people you have no connection with are trading these items for enormous sums of money the government comes and demands that you fork over $5,000,000 in wealth tax every year for simply owning something that other people value.  The entire concept of this is fucked up and it doesn't matter if its someones family heirloom tea set or amazon stock, taxing the value of something over and over again year after year is wrong.  You get taxed on the money you make, you get taxed on the money you spend, and now you are proposing taxing people for not spending money.  How do you build wealth when it is impossible to not constantly lose money to taxes?  What should be taxed is events, and that is what a capital gains tax is.  You are taxed on your gains over and above what you purchased the item for when you sell it. The current capital gains tax is 25% for assets held for 1 year or less and 15% on assets held longer than a year.  It was setup this way to discourage short term speculation and encourage investing.This system is how you end up with people like Buffett paying less taxes (as a percentage) than his secretary and needs to be changed.  An assets' cost basis (purchase price) should be indexed to inflation, if you bought something for $100 in 1985 and sold it today for $125 you didn't make money you lost it to inflation because 1985 dollars are worth a lot more than 2020 dollars.  Anything above inflation should be taxed like regular income.  Bezos, Gates, Buffet and others in their social class will end up paying 37% on the money they made on their stock sales but are not forced to sell it if they don't want to.  If you want to give a little bonus to middle class investors you could have two tax categories of income; income from wages and income from asset sales and both are taxed independently so if you make $50K a year from wages and $50K a year from investments both of them are taxed like independent $50K incomes instead of being added together and taxed like a single $100K income."

Capitalists completely control the productive process and also generally control what there is to do outside of laboring, eating, and sleeping. What you're mainly discussing is a phenomenon that arose within the last half century of capitalism's existence and mainly only exists within the imperial core; beyond which the problems of those living within the core are such that one can easily afford, say, Starbucks or an internet connection but ultimately struggle with housing, healthcare, and general costs of living. Those that criticize the quality of life within the imperial core are, once again, not criticizing consumerism, which you seem to believe they do.   You're strangely assuming socialists would want to destroy the internet, have coffee non-existent, etc.  Edit: Btw, *actual* hypocrisy would be a landlord who claims to be a socialist because he simply believes in socialism but neither engages in revolutionary action nor focuses on much beyond profiting off renting his property. Not liking capitalism but also buying things businesses sell, I wouldn't call that hypocrisy, unless you either accept:  A. people should be utterly miserable and do nothing beyond work, eat, and sleep within an already alienating and exploitative society  B. socialists have much better lives than the average American prole (they don't) and are actually themselves involved in a process that allows them to profit off companies  C.

Let's kick it up a notch:   * As an anti-capitalist, I have *very few* options to engage in society without engaging with capitalism.   It's just a starting point, eventually we reach the point of being unable to fully change the system entirely and accepting that with my talent and abilities that I can actually do more to reach my goals of rejecting capitalism by first succeeding with it.   Now, let's look at you guys:   * You claim to hate ""crony""-capitalism, yet the alternatives available to you to live your life while not engaging in ""crony""-capitalism are quite vast compared to an anti-capitalist being unable to engage in capitalism.   The alternatives available to you are far greater than the alternatives available to me. So...  ...if we took an unannounced tour of your house or apartment, loaded up your computer, looked into your phone and viewed your apps and user history: How many products or services could we find that you utilize that are ""crony""-capitalist businesses while a less or non ""crony"" alternative existed? For instance: Is your computer running Linux *on principle* or do you use Microsoft Windows or Apple iOS instead? Do you have Ikea furniture or is all your furniture locally or home made? Do you have *any* products that you bought through Amazon? Do you have Netflix, Amazon Prime, HBO Now/Go, or any other streaming service?   The list goes on and on and on and on. There are some arenas where you don't actually have much of a choice, such as your internet service provider or mobile carrier. But *most* of your purchasing habits do have very real choices *for you* as someone that (I assume) opposes ""crony""-capitalism; they are typically more expensive, less convenient, or otherwise more difficult to obtain but they are very much so available to you.  You want to portray anti-capitalists as being ideologically unsound in an environment where they have very little real choice; however, that's a tall order coming from someone who is far less ideologically sound in an environment where you have a *lot* of real choice."

I wouldn't put it that way. But, when you account for the eccomies of scale and the negotiation power of a single payer system, yeah I guess you could say that.

Libertarianism originated in our philosophical school the capitalist version your discribing is a miserable distorted version of our vision.   &gt;If you don't trust the government to enforce the law, which I can understand, in my system you could get some mercenaries to enforce the law for you. So long as my mercenaries can prove that Bezos acted aggressively to me, the state cannot prosecute me for having Bezos arrested.  Lol and you think you could afford better mercenaries than Bezos?

Taxing something tends to discourage that thing. If you tax net worth, people have an incentive to lower their net worth (presumably by spending more of their income on immediately consumable goods, or just focusing their life more on leisure rather than work or investment). If you tax residential housing, the value of residential housing as an investment goes down, so investment goes more into non-residential zones while the quality of housing diminishes.  &gt;how is it ok for people to pay 10% of their homes value in property tax every year but it's suddenly robbery if a billionaire has to pay 1% of his net worth in taxes?  It's okay for people to pay a tax based on the value of the *land* they own. That's because land is a natural resource that nobody created, which is available to everyone except to the extent that people monopolize it.  The same argument doesn't apply to buildings. A tax on buildings is indeed generally just as unjustifiable as a blanket tax on wealth. The value of real estate should be divided into the value of land and the value of improvements, and taxes levied only on the former."

If they 'worked a deal' with their local government, then they are likely increasing government revenues in other ways, like drawing people to the area (who then pay more income tax, who increase demand for property, which raises property taxes, etc....)  So a net worth tax is additionally taxing things that are already being taxed.  &gt; how is it ok for people to pay 10% of their homes value in property tax every year   Property taxes aren't near that amount, especially when you take into account market value of the home.

The pretext used by a few nations to label them as “terrorists” is that they were alleged to have provided materials to actual terrorist groups, such as the Taliban. Of course, it’s also accurate to consider the US military and the Saudis terrorists in that case, because we have also demonstrably provided materials to terrorist groups.  Why is this relevant? Well, mostly because you seemed to get your knickers in a twist when /u/Hhtura called the US military terrorists, despite the fact that this is an accurate label *if* we were to apply the standards which Americans use for other countries, to the US. This comment chain is in reply to that.  &gt; whether or not QS is an asshole who was justifiably killed  This claim is not even in your OP, and I’m not sure why you expect people to respond to a claim which is not present.

This is what **I’ve been trying to address** in the other thread, which you haven’t yet responded to (aside from using an embarrassing misreading as a pretext to berate me as an “Iran apologist” or something). Obviously you’re not very interested in defending this point, because you’ve done everything but.  If you want a tip on how to have more productive debates, I recommend you cut out the chaff (everything like *“ totally fucking ignorant of actual recent history”* is just a generic insult you could say towards anyone who disagrees with you - it adds nothing, nor does it demonstrate what the other person is ignorant of), and *begin* your post with a clear statement of the specific claims you’re defending. You know, a proper thesis statement, like you’re taught in school. Instead of just naming events (such as the plane crash/stampede), you also want to tie these into an actual structured argument in favor of your claims/thesis. Why would a funeral stampede, for instance, have bearing on whether Iran is capable of creating an extremely costly war for America or preventing them from destroying their government infrastructure?

Let them continue to call it their land. Let them buy and sell, and bequeath and devise it. We may safely leave them the shell, if we take the kernel. It is not necessary to confiscate land; it is only necessary to confiscate rent.  As for your example about trees and wood. Trees and other plants or animals are fundamentally different factors. Through labor you can cultivate more trees or breed more animals. With the exception of virgin resources and endangered plants or animals, they are easily replaceable. These things qualify, in the economic sense of the terms, as _Capital_ not _Land_. If you have capital which is tied to your land (like buildings and landscaping) then you are entitled to the value of those things when and if your land exchanges hands."

An institution not possessing either of these properties is not and cannot be, in accordance with my definition, a state.  To be opposed to the state is then not necessarily to be opposed to services that have often been linked with it; to be opposed to the state does not necessarily imply that we must be opposed to police protection, courts, arbitration, postal service, or roads and highways. It is certainly possible for such services to be supplied by private, non-state institutions, and indeed such services have historically been supplied by other organizations than the state.  Anarcho libertarian system includes: not only the abolition of the State, but also the general adoption of a libertarian law code. If the majority of the public are not libertarians, the State will not get abolished either."

Totally super good faith.   Lol if i say ""no"" it's just my response to something you don't understand and would be **way** to complicated to explain.   &gt;Then provide an argument showing any right that the government does not have to interfere with the market in any way to protect. It is not possible.  You need to work on your grammar. How tf are we supposed to debate properly if I can't even understand you?  If I'm reading this correctly, you want an argument for how Government protection of Rights doesn't interfere with the market?  Simple. The Free market doesn't violate Rights to begin with.

The market is just the collective whole of Sellers, Workers and Consumers that inherently balances for profitable trade.   &gt;I have provided issues, you aren't breaking them down or providing arguments.

In the late 19th century the acute changes caused by industrial growth and the adoption of mass production techniques proved the laissez-faire doctrine insufficient as a guiding philosophy.' https://www.britannica.com/topic/laissez-faire  ""All these trends influenced the progress of education. One of the most significant results was the gradual acceptance of the view that education ought to be the responsibility of the state. Some countries, such as France and Germany, were inspired by a mixture of national aspiration and ideology to begin the establishment of public educational systems early in the 19th century. Others, such as Great Britain and the United States, under the spell of laissez-faire, hesitated longer before allowing the government to intervene in educational affairs. The school reformers in these countries had to combat the prevailing notion that “free schools” were to be provided only for pauper children, if at all; and they had to convince society that general taxation upon the whole community was the only adequate way to provide education for all the children of all the people."" https://www.britannica.com/topic/education/Western-education-in-the-19th-century#ref47598"

I won't do it justice here, but he sets out how markets cannot properly operate because PRICES cannot be accurately calculated in a socialist system. How is one to know what the price of bread should be? Or the price of housing? Or the interest rates for lenders/borrowers? His work is free online if ever want to read it. I'll warn you though, it's pretty dense stuff to get through. If prices are wrong, then certain goods will be over-produced and others under-produced. Resources cannot be allocated properly towards the desires and needs of the consumers without accurate price signals.  There are many other critiques, like issues with motives and incentives...but I personally think the price problem is the biggest dagger to the heart. Again, socialists are free to pool resources, purchase means of production, and share ownership of them as they see fit within a free market system. There is nothing stopping them. It is just that those businesses cannot compete against privately owned businesses in terms of production rates, low prices, and high wages for workers. Many workers would rather get a guaranteed paid wage from an employer than share in the profits of the company. There is no risk associated with it. If they are part-owners in the means of production, they share in the profits...but they also share in the LOSSES. Many people do not want to take that risk. And that's TOTALLY fine. There is nothing wrong with choosing wage labor over ownership. Let people be free and make their own life choices."

I also see that the writer is a georgist and that the letter is very much in line with georgism (from what I get from the wikipedia article about georgism at least).  I have to think about the theoretical claims first though. The assumption is based on the supply of land being constant, that may seem correct because the physical amount of land is not changing (unless you live in the Netherlands... xD) but I'm not sure yet about that from a marginal utility point of view. The real marginal value might not be the same (eg. if your place has a nice view) so the tax must be on the actual value of the land. It would also have to imply that the owner cannot derive benefits from the land by other means than owning it (eg. mineral rights cannot be included in the ownership in that case)."

Coca-karl,2020-01-10 20:39:36,fdrrrey,t3_em9clm,t1_fdqjic0,There are a great deal of linguistic and mathematical skills taught in secondary school that are vital for the functioning of our society. An argument could be made that a focused secondary education could take 2 years to prepare a student for the career market rather than 4 years.   Post secondary education provides specialized training (which I think is your vision for professional training) or practice with flexible thinking (which would be vital for regular career changes). Each year of post secondary education is exponentially more valuable than the year prior. In specialized programs the longer a student is in the program they will have a better understanding of the minut details of the field and most also require practicum experience to complete each year. Programs focused on research or more generic fields provide students with practice gathering information from a large field of information. Post secondary education gives students a greater capacity to change careers or succeed in an eccomy being disrupted by technological developments.

It's not simply that they want iPhones but want them to be produced in a communist society, they think it's wasteful in general.   &amp;#x200B;  I'm a little confused as to what exactly you are getting at here, but if I have understood it correctly;  Yep, they are inherently wasteful, on account of the manufacturing process. If we can accept that the useful functions of mobile devices (phone, text, internet connection, support for individual applications) have been realised since the mid 2000s, I think it is a fair argument to say that we could develop a device capable of such functionality which would be far less polluting and harmful.  As an example they rely heavily upon a lot of rare earth elements which are mined in some horrific ways. However that is not the goal of the market, the market caters to the consumer in a vacuum, without regard to other members of society.

Countries would implement this in place of corporation tax, and private fuel taxes.     Start off with your carbon tax set to exactly match existing corporate/fuel taxes. Each month it trends by 0.5% upwards for carbon-emitting activity, and trends downwards for non-carbon emitting activities (towards zero).      Given that almost all carbon emitting activities are linked to energy, this will allow energy producers to offset the costs onto their consumers, this would create a market shift towards better energy sources.      Further more the increasing revenues from taxes as the carbon-emitting rates increase would allow for international funding of carbon capture projects, as well as provision of relief and compensation to people struck by climate disasters (eg, building new homes in Australia)     But that is a very quick and dirty answer which lacks any nuance or details."

It would also incentives landlords and property owners from keeping rent at inflated highs when there are no people willing to pay such rates as to keep the value of the property inflated.  In this structure, if you want to be a landlord, provide and maintain a property for an occupant, you're good to go. If finding an occupant becomes burdensome, you can put the property up for sale and save on the tax penalty or reduce the rent until someone finds it attractive. Any units that were purchased as a way to park cash are now costing the holder, so they would either need to undertake the role of a landlord, or sell their unit.

The difference is, communists are not as narcissistic. If we're discussing approaches to society and economy, it's important to consider all people and their issues.  You're right, why? Cuz you fail to realize everyone are by themselves. People are greedy. Even if you think that being a communist makes you a better and not greedy person you are lying to yourself. If I want to help the single mom I will, I don't want anyone forcing me to do so.   &gt;It's important to try and emulate a Bernie Sanders of sorts.  Right, Mr. 3 houses 1%er screaming 1% is bad. Why doesn't he sell those houses and start redistributing his money before thinking about redistributing other people's money.

I can always turn an acre of green into something, I can't always turn Amazon into profit, and that acre doesn't even have to be used for profit.

Beyond that, they made the mistake of keeping human planners rather than transitioning to computerized planning (they hypothetically could have but the planners didn't want to lose their jobs and at this point those running the government were no longer really marxists).  &gt;Monopolies are only created by government regulations swiping off competition. Also, if you support small businesses as you said before, you think those should be expropiated too?  That's nonsensical dude, what do you think the natural consequence of competition is? By definition competition creates winners and losers, i.e., free competition is the means by which monopolies would arise to begin with, honestly it's not even a leap in logic, it just takes rational deduction a child could arguably do. And no, I don't support small businesses, once again, I am a *marxist*. Besides it wouldn't matter if I did, the absorption and wiping out of small businesses in favor of monopolies is a natural consequence of market competition.  &gt;I know it seems nonsensical but I see communism as a radical position.

Which is one of the reasons that makes a Republic so important - assuming it's the type of Republic designed to protect human rights from conflicting legislation and mob rules. I got into an argument just yesterday with a relative about gun regulations, majority rules, electoral college etc. Her argument was that majorities should have final say. If most ppl vote on something it should pass. My argument was, that depends. Human rights, or civil rights are different. They're etched in stone so to speak. So she said - but if 80% of the country wants guns outlawed, you don't think it should be outlawed?. And my answer is - absolutely not. Self defense is a human right, that's why it's amended. ""But it's a majority, if 80% have no power that's not a democracy"". My rebuttal - thats bullshit. Majorities have been known to be wrong, it isn't uncommon at all. Don't agree? Then read up on Germany's history circa WWII.   &gt;They are probably responsible for feeding millions more people than would otherwise be fed.  True. And I'm sure the majority of their corporate management are good people. But the ones that aren't have the major shareholders in their back pocket. And they've accepted the bribes that helped create unfair monopolies on seeds, soil, AG regulations etc. All it takes is one greedy shareholder, one corporate headwig that can be bought and has enough corporate power, a lobbyist with political ties, and a corrupt politician. It's an investment in a way. An illegal and profitable one.   &gt;And you can't have corruption if there are no crooked politicians with power to peddle.  Precisely why I believe there needs to be a new branch of government dedicated to watching every single move and activity of every person in office. And why I believe that politicians should be required to waive a significant amount of privacy rights and civil rights while they're in office.

Its not on all your property, so you aren't being hit on everything, and also its a lot simpler.  Its one specific piece of property that gets an assessed value and you pay a tax on that.  Its easier for the taxpayer to understand what their bill will be, its easier for the tax collector to enforce.   Its somewhat more predictable for everyone involved, yes the property market can have bubbles and collapses, but its less volatile then say corporate stocks.  In addition to not being on all property its also typically at a lower rate then what some political candidates are calling for.   But that's just an issue of rates, not a basic difference between the tax levels.  It does share some of the problems with a straight wealth tax.  Its not a tax on income, on realized gains that  you get in liquid form, so sometimes it can be hard to pay.  You might be less likely to have to sell the asset (house vs some of your shares to meet the tax burden), but if you usually can't just sell part of it, and it pushes you out of your home not just your investment to do so.    &gt; Most American homeowners are already paying a net worth tax.   Not really.  Many homeowners have other assets, retirement accounts, cars (although ""personal property taxes"" on cars also exist), other things.   But for many it does at least resemble a net worth tax as for many the house is the biggest asset, or even noticeably bigger then all their other assets combined.   One thing that's even more negative about a tax on your house then a tax on net worth, is that you could have to pay it even with a negative net worth.  Say you bought at the top of a bubble and then the market collapsed.  You could owe more on your house then its worth, but still have to pay taxes on it.  &gt;  how is it ok for people to pay 10% of their homes value in property tax  every year but it's suddenly robbery if a billionaire has to pay 1% of  his net worth in taxes?   It isn't.  Its all robbery.  Any tax is.  Necessary evil, but not in purely direct terms a moral good or even a neutral thing."

This is a fair point, but an alternative view (and one that is more productive) is to have more people properly reaping the benefits of the economy. One of Mark Cuban's ways of making sure his employees were doing was by rewarding them with stock in whatever company he was head of. That, and better financial and market education in schools, would actually make it so more americans are aware of how the economy works and how they can benefit from it.  &gt;Everyone else who wouldn't feel that way can just remember how unfair the bailout was.  The American government actually got its money back on this... with interest! But the increase in size of the banks was pretty crap.  &gt;The SEC won't be all over anybody because the government knows the government just asked everyone to pay a tax...  Even so, how does this play out over time? People pay wealth taxes on their assets? Fine, where does the tax start? Are institutional investors taxed separately from personal ones? If so, what's stopping me from making an LLC to trade with instead? If not, this will start to kill interest rates in savings and money market accounts at banks and credit unions unless institutions with FDIC coverage or similar are tax exempt. *Even this is flawed though because it kills competition among banks, because it's ridiculously hard to start a new bank as is let alone getting the capital to start one without the ability to invest*.  Also you're being disingenuous to healthcare costs. Per person costs are quite low so unless you're paying for a family I don't see where you're coming up with hundreds per week.  Finally that 50% drop you're talking about will hit lots of people who responsibly saved their 401(k)s over time. Unless you're willing to insure their portfolios there's no conscionable way you could take it away. It's like forgiving student loan debt, it punishes people who put their nose to the grind and payed it off first instead of accruing assets.  We could agree on capital gains taxes to match income taxes for sure, that could even help the economy by discouraging people from selling while their wealth itself is still tied in stocks, but throwing a standing income tax on billionaires should really only effect standing monetary accounts over a certain threshold to *encourage* economic investment."

What the rich folk had did not generalize onto the rest of the populace. One of the hallmarks of industrialization is that it made food cheaper so that even poor people could afford it. What kind of good quality do you expect to have if there isn't even enough food for everyone?

Spasaro,2020-01-11 11:37:21,fdv31zp,t3_em1y3v,t1_fdtcffk,"&gt;I'm not convinced that monopolies are the evil that we all learned about in high school.  Funny you should say that. Because there is a monopoly you won't learn about at any school, or hear about from any major media source. But you can learn about them from a few credible peer reviews. A couple aren't that easy to find and the publishing houses they belonged to simultaneously removed the publications and tried to keep a lid on them. Both studies were conducted at the same time by different groups of historians and IG's for the purpose of providing one another with verified data by conducting their research using separate methods to obtain their data. And the findings were identical, with minor details that each report included on their own. But make no mistake. The existence of said monopoly, or conglomerate of monopolies rather, are some that are in particular - much bigger and controlled by a ruling class of people more powerful than anyone can describe and the vast majority of people aren't even aware of them and have never heard of them. They dont operate in secret, or in the shadows. Quite the opposite really. But none of us can begin to imagine the magnitude of power and wealth of the people behind these monopolist empires. Mind you, I'm not some tinfoil cap conspiracy theorist. I dont believe in bigfoot, UFO's, the Illuminati, reptilians, Agenda 21, Flat Hollow Dome Simulation Earth or any other variant of earthen lunacy, i dont buy any of the 2nd gunman in the grassy knoll at Rockefeller Plaza theories (in truth there was two gunmen and LHO wasn't one of them, and they were on roof of the depository) and I especially don't believe in moon landing hoax bs. Conspiracies do exist but I won't give any the time of day if there's even an ounce of skepticism (like the megatons of skepticism with 9/11 truther conspiracy theories.)   I dont expect you to be convinced by anything I say, you can research it yourself. And I wouldn't waste my time typing all this if it was bullshit (actually its speech to text and edited) I get no incentive out of blowing smoke. But one study in particular that couldn't get a lid put on it quick enough was first leaked on an episode of Ted Talks before it reached a publicist that was brave enough to publish it. However, the journal had names redacted from the report before it was published. Like I said, it's all out there for you to see for yourself. Don't take my word for it just because this is the trustworthy internet and so much credible information comes from sincere and honest Redditors. And the fact that we are all strangers to each other adds to the credibility but don't let that deter you from fact checking. (That's sarcasm) I don't even trust snopes. I cant count how many times I've come across their bs findings when I've fact checked them. They're about as credible as wikipedia or infowars.   The truth is this world is practically owned and controlled by a very wealthy and powerful monopoly of under 10k wealthy elites that control 40% of the global wealth. (Again, no it isn't the friggin illuminati, or the royal family, some shadow government, secret society or man hiding behind a curtain in a castle from some lucid dreamworld of a parallel reality, and no it has nothing to do with L.Ron's Xenu) The people behind these monopolist conglomerates of property and economic power includes the political power they have over every nation's government (except 3 nations in particular, that are still at their mercy regardless.) And while there's 60% of the global wealth remaining, the 40% that consist of empirical elitists are still a majority when you consider that the second wealthiest monopoly of global economic super power is the Vatican with just over 1.5% of the global economy. The Vatican is literally the second wealthiest economic superpower. That might not sound like much, but it's multitrillion. And the Vatican has power in over 140 nations. Still, that level of power doesn't scale by comparison. The vast majority that aren't in the 44.5% of the wealthiest super class, in other words the remaining 55+% is represented by 7,600,500,000+/- people. In other words you, me, everyone we know, and everyone else that exists. I'm not sure how many people the Vatican's 1.5% represent but I think the population of my town has more people. And that's currently 216.   There are three rings of power - each one inside the other. One larger, outer circle with a very small circle inside it, and an even smaller circle inside that one. The smaller the ring, the higher the wealth and the higher the power. The small rings control the larger ones. The outer circle consists of about 8500 elites. Very few are politicians and lobbyists (which are mostly N.American and Western European) but the amount might be a handful at best. It changes every so often. Sometimes there's two handfuls, other times none at all. Of course not all these 8500 people are billionaires. Those 8500 elitists are controlled by about 750 wealthier (for the most part), more powerful elitists. Everything you own, possess, use, consume and buy - everything from the tar on your street, to the doorknob of your house, to the device you're using right now and the shirt on your back (both the brand, the fabric and the machine that manufactured it) is tied to particular people in this middle circle of 750. They own and control 99.99% of every kind of resource, raw material, consumer products, retail providers, distribution centers, cargo shipyard, exchange docks, vendors, everything in between and beyond. Everyone and everything relies on something that the 750 club provides. Be it a communist nation that is sanctioned and completely encapsulated (except N.Korea), or a self sustained group that is mostly separated from the rest of society like Amish Quakers. If any of their very own conglomerates, including some they don't own, goes bankrupt or belly up - they make money from it's collapse through ""put options."" Everything you can think of, from your toothpaste made by P &amp; G, to your toilet paper provided by Johnson and Johnson (QPSI), to your electricity provided by the DOE (whether you're on the GE or Bell E. grid), to the banking cartel your mortgage broker works for, to every channel on TV, every RF broadcasted, every defense contractor, to the automaker of your car and the gas in your tank - all of it - they own and control most of it. Anything you can think of and everything you can't think of. From the food we eat, the paper we wipe our asses with, the porcelain we shit in, the water that flushes it, the pipes they flow into and the treatment facilities that process it. They literally make money off the food we consume to the final destination of raw sewage where it ends up at.   Those 750 are controlled by an even higher rank, of wealthier, more powerful ringleaders of exactly 42 people that we have very limited information about. People we've never heard of and all of them are men. Don't ask me what the connection to that is or if it means anything, I have no clue, other than the fact that it's the innermost circle that has always consisted of only men, and it has always consisted of exactly 42 members and the majority have always been middle aged. None of them are people that any of us have heard of or know a thing about. Only one has ever been high profile because he was British royalty during the emergence of the very first group of selected 42 when the 3 ""rings of power"" first emerged following the end of the French Revolution. Their level of power is beyond any other that exists. To describe them as above law is an understatement. That's about as much as we know except that the majority are N.American. And the rest are European and Asian. Each of the 750 are directly tied to one of the 42. There's some direct ties to the remaining 8500, but they're mostly under the control of all 750 and for the most part they don't communicate or consult with one another. The hierarchical control is more indirect like the strings of a puppet. But the 750 know the 42 very well and some are even preselected candidates in line as a member of that high rank when one becomes deceased. When a higher rank dies, he's replaced immediately. How and why they're selected is unknown. There doesn't seem to be any obvious commonality between who is selected. But a European is replaced by another European (most are British), same goes for N.American and Asian members. Some are connected to bloodlines that have been a part of it for generations and some are outsiders that worked their way up to success. One outsider in particular - you can watch his interviews on YouTube. He was a European elitist that made his way into the 750 rank and was of interest to the 42 as a potential candidate before he left it all behind. His story checks out as far as his success, business dealings and ties. He has a crazy af story. Only other significant thing that is known is that the 750 belong to some major global and economic think tanks. Such as the Trilateral Commission (which consists of the 3 major continental powers of N.America, Europe and Asia), The Council of Foreign Affairs (mostly N.American and Israeli) and the Bilderberg Group (which consists of every single member of the inner circle of 750 in lieu of the 42.) Additionally, many of the 750 are board members of the U.N. Panel, the Geneva Convention, and executives of the Central Banks. And some have close ties to the Intelligence Committees, the DOD, the DOJ, and the Supreme Court Justice's. Just about every instance of corporate welfare that's been granted by the U.S. government seems to have had an elitist(s) involved for the final say for federal approval. If that's true, that just goes to show how powerless elected officials are by comparison."

Managers increase the efficiency of labor more than the amount of labor they would produce if they worked as a laborer.  This is why managers exist as a role in the economy.  The government facilitates the same role.  Through it's existence things like coordinating medical facilities, power grids, public works projects, etc. Can be done in a way that it is *much* more efficient than if the people in government worked by pulling plows.  Let's say 1000 people plow 1000 units of work.  Now if the 1001th guy pulled a plow too then that's just 1 unit of work.  But if he instead spent his time figuring out more efficiences, innovations, communication, and plans and that in turn increased the amount of work produced by 10% then the 1000 are producing 1100 units of work.  As such his work is now worth 100 units of work.  Billionaire apologists say this means he deserves say 80% of the value of that 100 (80(.  Social Democrats say fuck you, we're the 1000 actually working you deserve closer to 10-20% (10-20).  Socialists say it's a job, same as any other so you earn the value of one laborer or an agreed upon value by the people (personally this makes the most sense to me, but I'm not going to force it).  Communists say everyone shares equally in the value.  Anarchists say that no one should do anything but labor. (As giving the 1001st person some of their labor value as payment for finding efficiency is a 'tax').   Now obviously lawyers, politicians, and all their corruptions have fucked our system to death, but this is the general idea behind it all.  I think we need to move towards communism/socialism and social democracy is a necessary transition to avoid needing an authoritarian state (Soviet) to manage the transition.

Like there's definitely a purpose to taxes and everyone gets out of it way more than they put in labor-wise but without the ability to say no thanks and move somewhere else freely and easily then you're removing their choice and that makes it theft (sort of).   I think the international community needs to create an agreeable space for conscientious objectors to go, but good luck getting anyone other than me to advocate for it (I totally think we should morally - www.yourwjb.com).

Contrast that with the fact that almost nobody stays in the same house they're born in or keeps the same job their whole life.  And the reason you make up the BS distinction between personal and private property is because you have no argument for why I can't sell my labor for a wage. It's none of your business.

The reason this makes sense to me, is because government primarily functions to protect property. Well, if it exists to protect property, then it makes sense to tie funding for it to property ownership. It also sets the stage to take it to the logical next step of simply privatizing the system and making it polycentric later down the line, if this transaction-based form of taxation proves functional."

I don't there's a single property claim that you couldn't ultimately trace back to SOME wrongdoing of some sort. Long before the US, before capitalism, before mercantilism, before feudalism, etc. But even then I would say my ""theory"" about property is probably closer to homesteading, which implies some sort of usage of the land. If I were dictator for a day I would change property rights such that you need to be using/improving or planning to use or improve the land in order to have a claim over it. You'd need to iron out some of the details of course, but it would ultimately be based on imbuing your own labor with it.  But this doesn't really have anything to do with what we're talking about, which is the difference between private property and monarchy. You seem to think monarchy is bad simply because it's one person giving edicts to other people, and that's just blatantly absurd. If you're in my bed, I'm going to give you some edicts, we're not equals if you're in my bed. I get to tell you to leave. And I get to dictate the rules under which you stay. So basically I just have no respect for this fetishization you guys have with democracy as a good in and of itself. There seems to be no basis for it. Democracy is a necessary thing in the context of governance for the reasons I keep mentioning, the inherent coercive nature of the state. People being BORN INTO a state and also it being prohibitively difficult to move to a different one. Those conditions make democracy necessary. That doesn't mean you can then take those notions of democracy and apply them to whatever you want, like the workplace."

tramselbiso,2020-01-11 21:28:20,fdybva9,t3_en70z5,t1_fdvp8bv,"&gt; The broader question : why would capitalism or socialism make any difference to the plight of the disenfranchised prostitute? I can guarantee that no politic system protects disenfranchised women,  Because the problem is thst many women are driven to prostitution because they are poor. This is a capitalist vs socialist problem. In a capitalist society, wealth is held in private hands so if a poor person has no wealth then they must subject themselves to exploitation as prostitution or other low paid workers do. However, in a socialist society, the wealth is publically owned so the poor would already have wealth. Of course, you could argue wealth in public hands has other side effects such as lack of incentive to work leading to no wealth generation at all. This is why a mixed economy with a welfare state where we apply socialism for the poor and capitalism for the rich, in my opinion, makes sense. Currently it is the opposite way around where socialism apply for the rich wjth bailouts and money printing for the rich if they fail while the poor are subject to full capitalism and must prostitute themselves and be exploited and subject to rough sex and rape and abuse just to survive. It is pretty sad. Humanity is evil. I will never have children."

There's no reason to believe free markets with the inclusion of protecting private property leads to monarchy. It's a purely theoretical exercise that for some reason I'm expected to take part in. Our current system, which is far from perfect, doesn't look anything like monarchy.  &gt;Monarchy is bad because the fundamental dynamic between the king and subject is arbitrary. The king is seen as master of the domain. Anyone within his domain must obey his law. And it is justified that he charge rent (taxes/tithe).

I can’t see how such a distinction is anything BUT useful. If we don’t distinguish, than we either end up defending monarchism or condoning rape.  You're misunderstanding the bed example. It is to demonstrate that the idea that democracy itself is a good thing, is clearly wrong. This is what I keep getting at, democracy is not good, it's just necessary in the case of governance because of the inherent coercive nature of the state. For example, you talk about the king imposing his will. That is completely irrelevant when ""the king"" is some guy in his own house. I can just keep walking right on by his house. It means nothing. The only problem with ""the king"" is that people aren't choosing to engage with him. It's not like there is anything wrong with me willingly engaging with a person and agreeing to their rules while I'm engaging with them. That's the bed example. You've provided no reason to make the distinction between personal and private property. Why is it ok for somebody to willingly submit to the rules of somebody else's bed, but it's not ok to willingly submit to the rules of somebody else's factory. They're both free to leave whenever they want. They both actively seek out this interaction. ""Because one is economic"" is not a meaningful distinction. It doesn't logically follow that submission to authority is somehow magically bad when it's economic.  &gt;If we don’t distinguish, than we either end up defending monarchism or condoning rape.  If by ""defending monarchy"" you mean ""defending the idea that somebody gets to decide who is and isn't allowed on their property"" then yes, and there's nothing wrong with defending that. Again, the DIFFERENCE with ""monarchy"" in the sense of a country is the fact that you are born into this agreement without accepting it and that practically speaking there's not much opportunity to choose something else. If your argument is based on the assumption that private property will somehow LEAD to a private king, I'm not interested in the hypotheticals, because you're just jumping right past the forces in the free market that push against that. So I don't agree with the premise that it will lead to monarchy."

You can’t indict one without indicting both. Or else it’s a double standard.  If I live on a kings land, I work the land and produce corn.

Holophonist,2020-01-11 22:21:57,fdymezu,t3_emvhxb,t1_fdyjpax,"&gt; Not true, there’s not a single “king of the world”. There are many kings you can choose from. Or you could gather an army and overthrow the king and become the new king.  Do you remember the half a dozen or so times I've pointed out that with kings you are born into a country without consenting and that practically speaking you can't move, as made evident by the fact that most people don't leave their country of origin, even today when it's cheaper than ever? So no, there wasn't really competition between kings. That was the point. I've said probably like 5+ times at this point.  &gt;Well it’s not an indictment of private property if it’s not an indictment of kings. You can’t indict one without indicting both. Or else it’s a double standard.  Except for the ways in which private property is different from kingship, as I've said. If we lived in a world where ""king"" meant something different, then yes they would be the same. But right now when somebody says ""king"" they think of a single dictator of a large swath of land where people are born into his servitude without consenting. That's what king means. If king to you just means ""anybody who has control over their property"" then sure they're similar, but you've removed the entire problem of kings in order to make them comparable.  &gt;If I live on a kings land, I work the land and produce corn. I sell that corn at market and then pay the king a portion of those earnings in the form of a tax. At least I get something in return: military security.  &gt;If I live on a capitalists land, I work the land and produce corn. I sell that corn at market and then pay the capitalist rent, but get nothing in return (except being able to use the land). But that’s not a privilege.  &gt;If I were truly entitled to the fruits of my labor I’d take home all the money earned by sale of the corn I grew. But because this imaginary thing called private property exists, I’m arbitrarily obliged to give the capitalist his share, as with the king.  It's not arbitrary. I'm not sure where you're getting this from. Let me give you an example: Let's say I work for the first 50 years of my life to earn enough money to pay a contractor and his crew to build me a factory. I then ask you to come work at my factory for a wage and you agree. It's not ""arbitrary"" that you don't get to use my factory without my consent. It's not yours. It's mine. I was instrumental in creating it. For all intents and purposes I DID create it, because I labored for years and stored the value of that labor in money, and transferred it to somebody who built the factory. For all intents and purposes I built the factory. You didn't. Why is it arbitrary for me to decide who gets to use my factory?"

I'm surprised that this term isn't contained in my CFA curriculum.    In my understanding, 'profit margin', which would be something like Revenue / Net Income, would be 6-10%, not coincidentally related to the average growth rate of the stock market itself.  &gt; The 2008 Crisis is pretty complex, but no doubt the competitive nature  of real estate sharks and people seduced into buying a house they can  never pay off were at the foundations of its beginnings.   I would go one step further.  Government pressure on banks to relieve Marx-inspired class struggle, creating sub-prime loans.  Then government guarantees, artificially and intentionally feeding the sharks you speak of, and artificially and intentionally seducing the people that you speak of.  The plan was to correct the inherent inequality in housing for the poor.  But when you artificially mess with free markets, well, bad things happen.  Happens in healthcare and college education, too.  &gt; this little game of boom, excess, and crash will continue for as long as we want it to continue.   And unless you are truly a free-market supporter, who doesn't want government creating 'rights to housing' or any other consumer product, then you are driving the cause.  &gt; And a way in which the TRPF can be exacerbated is by over-production,  especially in a place where competition and excess is the dominant  culture.   So maybe government should not be doing things that accelerate demand, like 'making things free for all'."

The food bank would have to stop being a food bank and become the state. It will have to become the representative of society in a given area and enforce its rules (which the vast majority of people agree with) and protect it from foreign threats at the very least. States do a lot more than that but this is the minimum it will have to do. You can now see that comparing the state to a food bank(or any other private entity) doesn't work because they are fundamentally different. Its apple to oranges comparison."

We have seen this time and time again, with the Chinese in the 19th century and most recently with Middle Eastern peoples due to the imperialist wars in the Middle East -  All racism caused because of economic laws demanding an ever cheapening of the production process, an incentive to use cheap foreign labour.

Where as negative rights only require you to take it upon yourself to not intrude on others. In other words, all rights are (or should be) negative rights.  To enforce a positive right, the government would have to take the services/goods from one person and give it to another. If voluntary, this would just be a typical charity and therefore has no reason to be a government service.  Of course there are always special cases, like a child being deprived of an education (e.g. reading/writing/maths bare minimum) or food has the right to be protected because they can't help themselves.

oppa_gangnam_styler,2020-01-12 03:46:45,fe01l8l,t3_en6c6g,t1_fdw7e0o,"I'm not opposed to private security, private investigators, private lawyers, as well as self defence of course. But I am opposed to private police and private courts. There is a distinction being made between government, the government is the sole entity which deals in force.  Any contract must not deprive people of their livelihood, and so long as the contract is legitimate (no duress) people are free to do as they please. You can't sign away your rights in favor of a private court system.  Boycotting criminals is a pointless endeavor. This is equivocal to making gun control laws, criminals don't follow them. If a store boycotts a shoplifter, they will just continue to steal as they did before."

And even if everyone *wanted* petrochemicals for reasons entirely independent of the context in which they live (which they don’t, but let’s pretend they do), that would still be bad because the use of them, especially at the rate we use them, is demonstrably fucking us in the ass. Therefore it would still be a moral imperative, to me, to limit their use even if by force because the health of the planet and the creatures on it hangs in the balance.   Therefore, building more pipelines is exactly the opposite of what we need to do regardless. Reduce the capacity to trade and transport it, while promoting renewable energy, and reduced demand will follow, which will be good for the environment. Just like how expanding freeways doesn’t solve traffic congestion. Presenting an option to people means more people will choose it, it’s basic cause and effect.

The past 30-40 years this has been worked around by outsourcing to less developed countries in Africa and/or Asia, but as f.e. China and India are rapidly catching up this will become unviable.  To cheapen the materials there needs to be more supply relative to demand, which has historically been solved by colonialism, or in the more modern era, investing in raw material production in less developed countries where there are less regulations and lower wages.  I frankly just don't see a future for capitalism, unless we can start colonizing the Moon and/or Mars in industrial scales by 2100 the market can't expand any more."

When applied to a single investment project or company, it’s essentially just ROI.

Jasko1111,2020-01-12 12:25:13,fe1x4f7,t3_enflth,t3_enflth,"Just as labour theory of value and surplus value, and falling rate of profit is incorrect theory.  Profit for Marx, is derived only from exploiting labour; it is the surplus value over the wages necessary for the subsistence of labour. Profits, on the other hand, have nothing to do with the amount of capital invested; for capital is only dead matter, stored or frozen labour, and can therefore no longer be 'exploited' to provide current profits. Only 'living' labour, then, can be used to provide profit for the capitalist. But if the amount of profit is extracted solely from labour, this means that any accumulation of capital will necessarily reduce the rate of profit earned by the capitalist.  There are great problems in Marx's model. His theory implies that, since profits are only derived from the' exploitation of labour, profit rates are necessarily lower in heavily capitalized than in labour-intensive industries. But everyone, including Marx, is forced to acknowledge that this manifestly does not hold true on the market. The tendency on the market, as Smith and Ricardo well knew, is for rates of profit to tend toward equality in all industries.  Marx's falling rate of profit follows from the accumulation of capital over time. For Marx capital is deadweight, and provides no profit to the capitalist. All his profit comes from the exploitation of 'living' labour, and therefore amassing more capital necessarily lowers his rate of profit, the ratio of his total profit divided by his total capital invested. And since the hallmark of capitalist development is continuing accumulation of capital, this means that capitalism is doomed to ever-falling rates of profit.   But, one may well ask, if the accumulation of capital necessarily slashes profits, why do capitalists, who are clearly motivated by a search for higher rather than lower profits, insist on continuing to accumulate? Why do they persist in cutting their own throats?  If the capitalists suffer over time from a falling rate of profit, and workers suffer from increasing impoverishment, who is benefiting in the distribution of the economic pie?"

No. It doesn't work that way. There is so much that we and you personally can do to save lives of people. We could spend so much less on entertainment to save lives, and yet, no society ever will. There is a cost benefit to everything. All sorts of jobs have risks to human lives, and the cost to gathering resources also has risk to human lives if it costs too much to supply a society with that resource. Sometimes, people will accept a small number of deaths to keep a resource reasonably priced. For example, most people consider a few people dying in a Lithium mine acceptable to keep the price of the element cheap for our precious batteries that are being used to fight climate change.  The same applies to food, people want cheap food, and any increase in price will be met with mobs who insist that raising the price of the food will cause ""people dying in the streets"", if not now, then later when the government cannot supply food, such as when North Korea had hundreds of thousands of people die when their food supply program failed. Worth pointing out, this was of course after the government stepped in.  We need reliable programs, and sometimes a government is the most reliable program since it tends to have the most power, but other times, individuals might be more reliable than a government. So it's complicated.  &gt;They do care, they just don't spend money on it. The two things don't equate to each other.  This is a petty nitpick. Yes, they do care, but not as much as they care about whether the price of netflix goes up $1 a month. You can make the argument that everyone cares about everything. The argument that I am making is that most people care more about buying worthless trinkets that they don't want to impress people that they don't like than they care about buying food made to the standards of the FDA, whether they would admit it or not, that's certainly what their actions demonstrate."

You can also fix these ""problems"" (if they exist) by lobbying your politicians and convincing your citizens to vote in people who would fix it. That's also my answer for your question really.

A product is only valuable as long as someone is willing to pay for it, be that in the form of money, labor or another product. Thus digging a hole in the ground is technically a product, but since it doesn’t benefit anybody, it has no value.  Labor is not the fulcrum of economics in my view, it is production/supply.  Say we had a fabricator (star trek style).  No labor would be required to produce anymore, but value would still exist. Labor is the sacrifice made to obtain products."

Everyone has to labor in some form either for themselves or for someone else.  Capital is any is anything you can use to turn a profit or make have a surplus of.

Labor has inherit value because it’s what makes capital.  I’m having the same questions.

As I have said I think a law that infringes on your rights or is authoritarian can be disobeyed especially so if you cant change it (via protests or re-election) but that is rather extreme circumstance like the example you have given. Most of the time when a law is 'wrong' its just an inconvenience or doesnt really infringe on your rights. If everyone starts disobeying the laws for that then no laws will be followed because someone will always find them 'wrong'.

If we try to transition to Marxism now, it will follow the same pathway as all the other collectivist experiments in the 20th century.  Lots of people will die, armed ideological individuals on both side killing each other - either defending their property or trying to take the property. It would not be peaceful, and other then its initial implementation - society would lose control very quickly - with the only solution, a dictator with a permanent state of marital law.  Sounds dystopian, but as an eastern European - very real.   Now I understand that wasn't Marx's intentions.  For Marx, capitalism would end and Marxism would replace it naturally - and using modern terms, that is going to be triggered by either a hypothetical post-scarcity situation or automation.  Let me tell you what IS going to happen - first, post-scarcity will never happen and two, to deal with the large chunk of retail and driving jobs that are lost a temporary welfare state will be set up, funded by transfer payments coming from an economy that is still very much capitalist.   This will be to deal with 1-2 generations that are in real trouble - and as their offspring enter the workforce they will with have other skills-sets that are not effected by automation.  And that is the negative aspect of automation - the positives far outweigh the negatives in my opinon.  Everything gets cheaper while we forget about the menial tasks that we used to do everyday."

Emoticone11,2020-01-12 18:18:06,fe3upz1,t3_enflth,t1_fe1pvj4,"The difference is just that corporate profits is total revenue less total costs and tax, whereas rate of profit is essentially return on investment: the *ratio* of corporate profits to capital invested (averaged across the economy).  The economy-wide rate of profit, rather than merely corporate profits, is used because Marx is analyzing competition between firms, and thus the drive to reduce unit costs by making profitable investments. This tends to result in a mechanization of production over time, where firms invest in higher amounts of fixed capital to lower variable costs such as labour. Marx called this “increasing organic composition of capital”, and it’s important because while this mechanization increases the individual rate of profit for the firm(s) which are able to reduce unit costs the most, it tends to decrease the average economy-wide rate of profit.  Recall that higher “return on investment” is the primary incentive for investing in some capital; it tells you the profitability of that investment. If the TRPF is true, it means that overall the incentive to invest is decreasing, which can lead to stagnation of capital stock and profits. This in turn leads to crises, which temporarily reverse the TRPF, increasing overall profitability, at the expense of going through a recession/depression. But since these crises are only a temporary upheaval of the TRPF, Marxist theory predicts that such crises will become more frequent and economic booms less frequent (of course, this can be counteracted by things like discovery of new markets, such as with the opening of free trade between countries).

But first the RP is not a Law, it is a tendency. The RP can be pulled from all ends, a multitude of factors working for and against each other. It doesn’t mean we are destined to go to 0%, imo.   They explain the RP tend to equalize is because capitalism needs to stretch its arms out, and in the process capital can be pooled into low profit sectors, raising profit, and whatever goods produced then become in abundance, lowering prices. Then whatever contending sectors are around help further equalize values of production in marketplace. Some win, most lose. Leaving competition to its instruments naturally leads to monopoly. Which is the reason why capitalists keep cutting their own throat, as you put it. Acquire as much capital as possible and beat the competitors.  The small-capitalist in the mall doesn’t benefit, they got closed down. And the workers definitely don’t benefit. So good question, who IS benefiting from all this? Hmmm"

That includes both the use-values it produces and the utility that people derive from labor directly such as feelings of accomplishment, mastery, having a challenge, etc.  In a capitalist society, I believe this inherent value is reduced as labor power becomes commodified.  It takes on other forms of value such as exchange-value, and in doing so becomes the basis for a new form of value embodied in the commodities it creates.  I believe labor in capitalism is ""estranged"" (as Marx called it).  That is, while people may still derive the aforementioned feelings and motiviations from performing labor itself, the primary function of labor becomes one of indirect utility.  Labor in capitalist society is social, that is, the labor we perform sees its products consumed by others in society... we produce for others needs and wants, **yet** is simultaneously private in its appearance, i.e. because it is performed for a wage, it appears as though it is private labor; it appears as though we ""work for ourselves"" and ""for our own ends."""

DonFitzcarraldo,2020-01-12 20:04:56,fe4huzt,t3_enoo9o,t3_enoo9o,"I would largely agree with your friend. Capital to me includes things like productive land, machines, data, currency etc. that are used in conjunction with labor to produce surplus value by providing socially necessary goods and services. Pragmatically, I have no problem agreeing with the capitalists here that labor doesn't have inherent value in this sense, in that it may be applied in socially unnecessary ways or ways that don't produce surplus value.  Morally, I think labor has inherent value in that people who can pull their own weight should do so as it benefits the individual, so much so that I think if we actually survive to post-scarcity, people will still work to have a purpose.   What has no moral value to me is possession of capital, especially if one was born into wealth, but even if someone worked to attain it. Obviously capital and labor are both necessary for production, but I think capitalism overvalues capital and undervalues labor. Shareholders do varying degrees of socially necessary labor, but they take all or the lion's share of the surplus value produced by virtue of their capital contributions, not their labor, and for this reason I would say they do not pull their weight.   I call myself a socialist because I think cooperatives could be viable alternatives to private ownership, and would diminish exploitation in that surplus value is returned to worker/owners. This would also diminish the ability of people to live on passive income, which is almost always extracted from someone else's labor, and usually has more efficient viable alternatives such as single payer healthcare and education vs. interest accumulated by private insurers, or large-scale landholding and property management vs. homeownership, housing cooperatives, or even small-scale landlords (since temporary living situations will always be necessary and such landlords often contribute their labor to upkeep, either directly or indirectly).   Passive income is also socially undesirable as it tends to accumulate to such a degree that leads to undue political influence, regulatory capture, and emergent phenomena which reinforce the overvaluation of capital, caused by people protecting their own immediate economic interests."
marximillian,2020-01-12 20:06:52,fe4ie8m,t3_enoo9o,t1_fe4ggsp,"&gt; Without the desires of the individual, that utility is absent.  Indeed, and without the objective properties to fulfill those desires the utility is absent.  An orange will not provide any utility if your desire is to bang a nail into a board.  &gt; Individually determined value, the only type that exists.  Clearly individuals do not determine all values, and it is patently the case that more than one exists.  The ""value of your car"" for example in common parlance would be the market price, which is determined by many individuals competing in a system of exchange.  Even for a single individual transaction, the exchange-value of a good will be determined by a host of factors as mediated by at least **2** individuals, not a single individual.  That you value X at A and I value X at B does not take away that there is some value at which the good actually exchanges, C.  These are clearly different senses in which we use the word ""value.""  &gt; Subjectively defined use-value obliterates the very foundations of his system.  I'm not sure what you mean by ""his system"" here.  Capitalism is certainly not ""Marx's system"" whatever that means.  Perhaps you mean that it obliterates his theory of capitalism?  But not at all.  Use-value has a subjective component in Marx's theory, although he never explicitly used the words ""subjective"" or ""objective"" it's pretty clear from even the first few chapters of Capital that Marx understands subjects derive utility from commodities, and it is only from this subjective utility with which commodities can even have exchange-value.  &gt; _A thing can be a use value, without having value. This is the case whenever its utility to man is not due to labour. Such are air, virgin soil, natural meadows, &amp;c. A thing can be useful, and the product of human labour, without being a commodity. Whoever directly satisfies his wants with the produce of his own labour, creates, indeed, use values, but not commodities. In order to produce the latter, he must not only produce use values, but use values for others, social use values. (And not only for others, without more. The mediaeval peasant produced quit-rent-corn for his feudal lord and tithe-corn for his parson. But neither the quit-rent-corn nor the tithe-corn became commodities by reason of the fact that they had been produced for others. To become a commodity a product must be transferred to another, whom it will serve as a use value, by means of an exchange.)[12] Lastly nothing can have value, without being an object of utility. If the thing is useless, so is the labour contained in it; the labour does not count as labour, and therefore creates no value. -- Karl Marx, Capital, Volume 1, Chapter 1_"

bizzthekid,2020-01-12 20:17:56,fe4kk6a,t3_ensgs7,t3_ensgs7,"First there’s a difference between private and personal property. I feel like it is important to make a distinction between the two. Personal property= cars, homes, watches, phones, etc. stuff you use for yourself. Private property is capital, which is used to create profits for capitalists=factories, machines, tools, etc. Capitalism, as you have stated is free markets and protection of private property. Socialism is the abolition of private property. Some socialists call for free markets, some called for planned. But private property is the difference. And the reason why the elimination of private property is important is to eliminate class. Private property legally allows a capitalist to make money without working. And it also forces workers to sell their labor power to someone with private property. It creates a small class of owners of capital and a large class who don’t own capital. There could be many ways in doing so, one was what the Soviet Union did, by making private property become public property, which in my opinion did not eliminate class it just changed who the exploiting class became, which was the government. Another form are worker self directed enterprises or worker coops. Where the property of the firm is not owned by a capitalist or group of capitalist, but the workers. And then these workers could decide what to do with the surpluses that they created. With private property the workers do not have a say because it is more profitable to listen to shareholders and board of directors. In short the policy for socialism is to put the ownership of capital into the hands of those who work everyday, regardless of how far down the totem pole you are in that particular company."

marximillian,2020-01-12 20:23:12,fe4lptu,t3_ensgs7,t3_ensgs7,"&gt; For me as a capitalist that is very easy, i want private property and free markets in terms of policy.  These are not examples of policy.  An example of policy related to these might include, for example, ""The government has no ability to acquire property through force, i.e. does not partake in taxation, does not practice eminent domain, etc.""  With respect to free markets one might say, ""the government does not subsidize costs, nor tax profit, does not regulate standards for health, efficiency, etc.""  One policy which I think must be the foundation of a socialist society is that its government should not permit the use of violence to exclude others from use.  This would go so far as to include the need for the government to intervene when violence is used in order to exclude others, however, would not negate the right to use violence in cases of self-defense or safety, i.e. we would not necessarily allow 5 year olds to be driving cars, however, you would not be permitted to use violence to prevent any sufficiently aged and licensed adult from driving a particular car.  We may, of course, also create laws against the ""wanton destruction of social wealth,"" e.g. to simply burn down a factory because you wanted to entertain yourself would likely not be permitted.  Nor would smashing the windows of cars in order to be able to drive them.  Of course, there is no single policy which enables one system or another.  Laws and policy are extensive, and it is the aggregate of these things and how they intersect and work together that grant and/or prevent certain actions within a society.  So while these may be baseline examples, obviously they would exist in a larger context.  That context would, of course, include the way in which things are produced and distributed to begin with.  So, using the car example from above, we would then not treat cars as ""individual property"" (personal or private or whatever you wish to call it), rather they would, if they existed at all, be treated as social property.  I personally think cars should only be produced for very specific needs of travel in particular locations and for entertainment and that the bulk of transportation should be converted to systems of efficient mass public transportation.  If you think of how many cars we produce and how much time they spend time just sitting there taking up space, it should become quite clear not only could we create extensive systems of busing, commuter rail, etc, for a fraction of those resources, but these system would also provide ample coverage to remain nearly as efficient."

wylight,2020-01-12 20:23:23,fe4lqsa,t3_enpysk,t1_fe3frmk,"The state owns almost 60 percent of the wealth, saved in an equally distributed trust, employs over a third of the working population and over 70 percent of labor is protected under unions. Since the state exists through democratic elections, they are, fundamentally more socialist, than Venezuela or China. In that the workers do in fact own a large sector of productive capital property. (Meaning the means of production producing wealth are not privately owned) 89 percent of their gdp is stare owned, so while Norway allows private business run by a capitalist to exist, the wealth generated by that is a paltry amount compared to their state run public ally owned companies. Even their state oil production only accounts for a quarter of that wealth. So they are a mixed economy which has markets they are not more capitalist than the US or other such nonsense. They are pretty much a democratic socialist society with mixed economic elements. Kind of an inverse of the US in fact which is a largely private capitalistic society where most gdp is privately controlled with small amounts of socially owned goods and services. But with our campaign finance systems and voter suppression tendencies it’s hard to argue that these tiny social systems are in fact democratically controlled here since there is very little democratic control over anything in government. Look at the entire history of the US in relation to native Americans and Mexico to see how state violence and state oppression works in order to expand and protect capital interests. Its a very free system for merchants and legalists, but not for the poor. It’s on the books illegal to be poor in the US. You can’t be homeless. We kind of allow it but raid them every so often. But to just say I don’t want to work and I’ll live on the streets is criminalized. That’s how a state can enforce labor to work. General strikes are largely illegal. I mean it’s there baked into the system. We struggled to even make unions legal in this country. Right to work states which make it legal to terminate employees trying to form a union. I mean come on you’re just putting blinders on at this point not to see how the state is used to defend and protect capital interests."

This means a state organised by councils (Soviets) and worker mass organisations (unions, women's leagues, youth leagues, worker councils, etc.) under the leadership of the communist party in a democratic, participatory way.  A Marxist-Leninist state enacts the policies of 1.) socialization of the means of production which may be a gradual process or an immediate process depending on the development of productive forces, turning the heights of the economy into socialist public ownership, 2.) introduce a national plan cooperating with the cooperative sector to plan the economy rationally according to use-values as the primary indicator, 3.) outlaw land ownership, 4.) introduce the constitutional right to a job, 5.) form farming cooperatives, 6.) introduce universal welfare, healthcare and education, 7.) abolish the privileges of religious institutions and introduce atheism in schools, 8.) introduce same pay for same work for men and women and 9.) diversify the industry to achieve self-sufficiency.

The state gets authority from the implicit social contract you make by using any of a state's services (protection from foreign threats, ownership claims, the protection of all your rights and much more).

Market price is meaningless. The value of the car is still determined by the individuals involved in the transaction and their subjective values.  I've noticed that Marxists love throwing statistical terms around without grasping that their use doesn't support their arguments no more than saying that ""energy is conserved"".  &gt; These are clearly different senses in which we use the word ""value.""  Yet value is always subjective as it pertains to a single individual. Which is what I've been saying.  &gt; Perhaps you mean that it obliterates his theory of capitalism?  Marxism is a critique of capitalism, so yes. His critique is obliterated.  &gt; Marx's theory, although he never explicitly used the words ""subjective"" or ""objective"" it's pretty clear from even the first few chapters of Capital that Marx understands subjects derive utility from commodities  If it was indeed important, he would've specified it. His system of analysis doesn't work when you use subjective value.  &gt; This is the case whenever its utility to man is not due to labour.  See how he uses collectives and averages to make a point. The utility to one man is different from the utility to another.   &gt; Lastly nothing can have value, without being an object of utility.   What is utility then?

Consider that under the free market, there are jobs which involve health risk or are otherwise undesirable, and people who voluntarily work the jobs are compensated for the increased risk or to offset the objectionable condition.  What does an economy without a profit motive have to get such jobs covered but force? When people are under greater force from a central government, they are less likely to choose that government again, so if elections exist we again see force."

And if they decide they really just don't feel like cleaning up, well, *you* get the privilege of scrubbing his poo stains out of the toilet.  Of course you might say you can always pack up and move. You know, just abandon your neighborhood, your community, the friends you might have made, the park you love, the four minute commute to your place of work. Spend weeks packing up, finding someplace new, unpacking. And then hope really, really hard it doesn't happen again.  Is this the society you have in mind?"

A socialist political movement could take several decades to reach that stage if necesary, but it should always be trying to make further progress towards it."

They would most likely end up reverting back to a monarchy. The same happened with communism. They fought and killed people to install it only to to fight to get rid of the system. Just because methods work for certain goals does not mean they will work for all. Everyone in Soviet Russia who died in the workers revolt died for nothing because their goals failed.

They can only maintain power if everyone is largely complicit.   Yeah but that's easier said than done and most people prefer safety over freedom, not to mention that most authoritarian states are very good at striking enough fear into people so that they don't act.  &gt;So tell us more about this social contract, what exactly does it say? Who made it? Can we read it? Who are the parties who signed it?   The social contract isn't a physical document (though a constitution of a democratic state might be argued to be one) but more of a implicit agreement between all members of society to each other and the state to follow common rules and have a enforcer of said rules- the state. In the end the state is the personified common will of society as in democratic states the people directly and indirectly control it.   Now I know what you will say: ""But I never agreed to it!"". Well, yes but actually no. You didn't sign a physical document (because that's both impractical and unneeded considering the vast majority of people support the state) but you implicitly agree to it by following its rules and using its services. A example is going to a restaurant and ordering something, here you don't sign a contract but there is an implied agreement that: 1st the restaurant will give you the food and 2nd you will pay after you eat it. That's also incidentally possible because of the state which enforces this verbal/implicit contract.   A more direct way I can show you that you actually agree with it is that you either walk on and/or use public roads and streets. But wait a minute, did you actually ask to be able to use state property? By the social contract and the laws of the state you are allowed to do so but you said you haven't agreed to anything so does that mean you are trespassing? There many other examples but I think the ones I have given are sufficient to prove my point."

Saloth Sar, and the other leaders of the KR, were primarily Khmer nationalists, fighting mainly to restore historical traditions from the feudal Angkor empire. This included various de-industrialization initiatives which aimed to put the peasantry at the forefront of the revolutionary movement, which is pretty much the opposite of orthodox Marxist views (or ML views as well) - these tend to look favorably upon industrialization, or at least see it as a necessary historical stage prior to communism. At times, the KR leadership denounced communism for these reasons and others:  &gt;*""It is clear now that when Ieng Sary [Co-founder of the KR] told ASEAN in April 1977 that ""we are not Communists ... we are revolutionaries"" and do not ""belong to the commonly accepted grouping of Communist Indochina,"" he was being absolutely truthful.118""*  &gt;*""The only substantive difference is that the SF-PRK consider themselves to be explicitly ""progressing toward socialism,"" while DK now intends to ""adopt the democratic system of government and will not construct socialism or communism.""188 In conformity with the last, the DK Communist Party, which ""was founded to be an independent political party ... particularly to fight against the ""Indochina Federation"" doctrine of the Vietnamese Communist Party,"" has been dissolved; and Ieng Sary, on a visit abroad, has declared himself happy with Reagan's electoral victory and has stated that ""we have given up socialism, at least for a generation, perhaps more.""189""*  (from [Michael Vickery](http://michaelvickery.org/vickery1999cambodia.pdf))  From [marxists.org](https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/ncm-7/mlp-kamp.htm):  &gt;""The Khmer Rouge also had numerous voluntarist views on building up agriculture. They did have certain prejudices against industry although the stories of a complete destruction of all industry are exaggerated. The voluntarism was based on utopian-nationalist views which glorified the peasantry. They glorified the historical traditions from the Angkor empire of the feudal past. But in these policies, they ignored science or the limits of objective factors and their voluntarism ultimately collapsed in disaster, as they turned to squeezing the rural population heavily in order to prepare for war.  &gt;In this regard, it is important to note that the movement was extremely nationalist to the point of chauvinism. Despite their Marxist-Leninist phrases, the pronouncements of the Khmer Rouge were marked by the absence of even much lip service about internationalism. Internally they promoted an extreme Kampuchean nationalism. For example, in the rules for their new society, their “class analysis” placed both capitalists and national minorities in one category of “depositees.” Although their official pronouncements did not show it, there seems to be some evidence that they inculcated positions of seeking a “Greater Kampuchea,” with the dream of recovering Kampuchea Krom, the one-time Kampuchean territories which have been part of south Vietnam for some time now.  &gt;In the social sphere, there were social codes which sought to enforce an extreme puritanical regimen. This is hardly a sign of “communism” or “ultra-leftism”; rather it smacks of idealizing peasant conservatism.  &gt;Their political-organizational conceptions were also strange. As has been noted, the “Communist Party” was kept secret until 1977. Until then, everything was done in the name of a mysterious Angka – The Organization, whose character was not explained to the masses. This of course has nothing connected to the Marxist traditions of the proletarian movement. Marxism-Leninism promotes a party concept actively among the masses; far from hiding the existence of the party Marxist-Leninists lay a great deal of stress on training the proletariat to build up its own class political party.  &gt;The brief survey here shows that the policies of the Pol Pot movement were alien to Marxism-Leninism. They were policies with a peasant populist flavor. But the peculiarity of these policies do not provide evidence for the standard view promoted about Pol Pot’s Kampuchea. There was glorification of the peasantry and agriculture, but there do not appear to be general policies of elimination of all industry, medicine, intellectuals, etc. Perhaps this is because the movement was more complex than being merely a peasant movement. Of course the practices of the movement were not just a direct outcome of all their policies; undoubtedly their policies fed into the committing of harsh acts which went beyond even their own policies.""  Historian Ben Kiernan also makes a case in [The Pol Pot Regime](https://www.amazon.com/Pol-Pot-Regime-Genocide-Cambodia/dp/0300144342) that the ideology of the KR is fundamentally at odds with orthodox Marxism.  &gt;following the Engels goal of destroying large cities  No such thing exists. There is no ""Engels goal"" of destroying large cities.  &gt;Such acts as picking wild fruit or berries were seen as ""private enterprise"" and punished by death.  Yeah... somehow I doubt this particular one. Not to detract from the overall atrocity."

Abolish the monarchy and collectivise all crown and state property.   Weaken the powers of the premier and strengthen those of parliament. Abolish the Senate and expand the number of MPs. Elections should be on a proportional basis with a single-transferable vote.   During peacetime, the defence force should be limited to 20,000 active personnel and 50,000 reservists. Nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and testing of such weapons *must* be banned from Australia and her waters. All foreign military personnel must be expelled.   Investment in or by hostile regimes such as China, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Iran, Russia, or the United States must be banned until such a time as those countries conform to the values of liberty, republicanism, and socialism.   Capitalists who have or attempt to outsource all or part of their company or who attempt to offshore their funds are to be sanctioned, with the company possibly being collectivised. Capitalists with dual-citizenship who attempt to outsource, or offshore their funds are to be sanctioned, deported, and theirs assets seized.   All nonviolent offenders, with the exception of white-collar crime and politicians convicted of gross political corruption are to be paroled. Legal reform should be a high priority.   Every effort should be made to relieve the tax burden on the working class and to ensure the health and eventual expansion of our social programmes.   Environmental restrictions must be passed and vigorously enforced. Progressive restrictions culminating in an eventual ban of oil, petrol, natural gas, and coal for the majority of uses.  A right to free expression, freedom of conscience, and free protest must be explicitly included in any new constitution. The right to bear arms as well, and the gun-control policies of the Liberal and Labor governments must be reversed.   Each Australian Republic would be a federation of worker's councils, each being representative of a given canton (currently called Local Government Areas). The members of these coucils would be 2/3rds popularly elected on the same principal of parliament, with members being elected from candidates proposed by the various political parties, trade unions, and interest groups.

The workers would have a say in their representation, and they would have somebody in charge of the company directly accountable to the workers.  40% of the profit would to the workers, and the other 60% would still go to the privileged class of capitalists.

Eric_VA,2020-01-12 23:16:36,fe5lp3z,t3_ensgs7,t3_ensgs7,"Your question is loaded. You are asking people to do something contradictory.  Socialism is not a set of policies, it is a political ideology (I'm the broad sense of 'ideology') defined by the desired outcomes. Socialists, when acting politically, try to reach that outcome.  Let me clear out some stuff for you, because I feel this is a problem for this entire sub. You are not a capitalist, except if you invest capital or have a business. Capitalists are people who invest capital for profit.  Your ideology is called ultraliberalism, or free-market fundamentalism. It postulates that as long as free markets are guaranteed, general good follows in a self regulated way.   Free markets are not policy, they are desired outcomes because general good supposedly follows automatically. Now, I won't go on about all the flaws in this logic, but: this is not what capitalism is; capitalism and free market are not one and the same thing and do not need each other to exist; markets fail and cause great catastrophe; markets do not self regulate perfectly for stuff outside of markets like pollution and health risks of economic activity...  And most importantly: free markets require the state to exist. So does capitalism. Capitalism exists because of a set of laws and institutions that regulate propriety laws and contracts in a specific way that makes it exist. Also, free competition of any kind tends to someone WINNING. that's a monopoly, so you need regulations to keep the markets free.  As you can easily see, your ""policy"" is contradictory and tells us nothing about capitalism. The real capitalist policies are those institutions, laws and norms that regulate property and contracts.  A significant criticism frequently made of neoliberalism (the ultraliberal political project) is how it postulates some policies in order to attain free markets and deregulation and then prescribes it to every country as a formula. Such insistence is obviously absurd, because not every country and society needs the same set of policies. And the same goes for socialism. There are socialists almost everywhere, but they cannot all push the same policies. They must account for the specifics of their historical circumstances, their institutions and their economic realities.  Sorry for being blunt, I tried to say a lot and be brief at the same time."

Whether or not the violence proportionally is justified is a separate question.  Even in most places which recognize private property you can't just shoot anyone who steps on your lawn.  But certainly if someone is threatening your health, or safety, or privacy, then some sort of proportional force to make them stop or prevent them from doing so further can be justified.  The distinguishing factor is not violence, but for what reasons one is justified to use such.  ""Because it's mine..."" simply wouldn't be recognized as a justifiable reason.  &gt; Now surely that includes the ability to exclude people you disliking being around?  Well, I wouldn't call it mere dislike... But obviously you would probably dislike someone who threatens your privacy, health, safety etc.  So, sure, there is some overlap there.

To skip the intro: money begets money and monopolies/oligopolies are inherent in a capitalist system. Leave a system for longer than a few decades and it will mathematically collapse. Keynes describes this in very much detail. After those few years, you will have problems with people not having money to buy stuff, so you produce less stuff, so less people get employed etc.      Now even before this collapse happens, people will be on the street. So you need the state to keep them in line. To defuse this and prolong the life of the system, you need the state to regulate, introduce education and social safety etc.       The correlation of political freedoms and 'socialism' is a bit a selection bias. Revolutions are most likely in nations where other methods to achieve change are not possible. And change is not possible, usually, in the lesser developed nations. You don't build democracy in a day, least of all when the intentional brigades are landing in the north or the CIA is all over you.

It's obligatory, yes, and you really have no choice but to sign one social contract or another, not to mention the huge barriers most people face in moving from one country to another. It's also enforced by the state's monopoly on violence, sure.   My basic dogma is the one often referenced by Chomsky, that ""authority, unless justified, is inherently illegitimate and that the burden of proof is on those in authority. If this burden can't be met, the authority in question should be dismantled.” The problem is that lots of people can agree with this in principle, but pragmatism, not this ideal, guides peoples justifications for authority, both state and private. To over-generalize, I think socialists err on the side of justifying state power, and capitalists err on the side of justifying private power, and they often do so because of different underlying values and metrics.   If you feel like giving some more detail, what I'm always curious about with ancaps and American libertarians is where the pragmatic element comes in. Usually there's some short list of roles the state fills in a way that the private sector cannot which justifies the necessary evil of taxation. So things like military, police, prisons, air traffic control, highways, utilities, etc., right?   So what are your exceptions and what might be the guiding principles and acceptable trade-offs that generate the list? Can the private sector perform the roles I listed, in addition to roles performed by agencies like the EPA, FDA, OSHA, etc?"

L_Gray,2020-01-13 00:17:05,fe5tk11,t3_ensgs7,t3_ensgs7,"I suspect one reason you won't get much of an answer is explained by Max Weber's *Politics as a Vocation* which talks about the ethics of ultimate ends vs the the ethics of responsibility. The ethics of ultimate ends (used by many socialists) seeks the goals announced by political movements without regard for the concrete steps that must be taken to achieve them or for their unintended consequences.   Opposed to it is the ethics of responsibility, which requires that proponents not ignore such consequences. This explains why many socialists are all over the map when you try to pin them down on details. They are more concerned with self-righteous posturing than those pesky details.    Max Weber:    &gt;We must be clear about the fact that all ethically oriented conduct may be guided by one of **two fundamentally differing and irreconcilably opposed maxims**: conduct can be oriented to an '**ethic of ultimate ends**' or to an '**ethic of responsibility**.' This is not to say that an ethic of ultimate ends is identical with irresponsibility, or that an ethic of responsibility is identical with unprincipled opportunism. Naturally nobody says that. However, there is an abysmal  contrast between conduct that follows the maxim of an ethic of ultimate ends ­­that is, in religious terms, 'The Christian does rightly and leaves the results with the Lord'­­and conduct that follows the maxim of an ethic of responsibility, in which case one has to give an account of the foreseeable results of one's action.   &gt;   &gt;**You may demonstrate to a convinced syndicalist, believing in an ethic of ultimate ends**, **that his action will result in increasing the opportunities of reaction, in increasing the oppression of his class, and obstructing its ascent ­­and you will not make the slightest impression upon him.** If an action of good intent leads to bad results, then, in the actor's eyes, not he but the world, or the stupidity of other men, or God's will who made them thus, is responsible for the evil.    &gt;   &gt;The **believer in an ethic of ultimate ends feels 'responsible' only for seeing to it that the flame of pure intentions is not quelched**: for example, the flame of protesting against the injustice of the social order. To rekindle the flame ever anew is the purpose of his quite irrational deeds, judged in view of their possible success.  &amp;#x200B;  I think this also explains why you always get the answer, ""it's not real socialism"" because for many socialism isn't a process, it is simply the end result."

Imagine that the Soviet government payed out wage of 1000 rubles to all its workers and employees, and then the state tryes to sell to the same workers and employees some goods.

Socialism isn't just super-progressivism; it represents the total negation of liberalism. Not even demsocs will talk to you about ""socialist policy.""

If you're asking ""how do you get to socialism,"" I can only answer that as a platformist, which is a set of specific tactics native to a subsect of a subsect of a subsect. You are asking for about ten thousand different answers, all of which have varying track records and are only appropriate at certain points in a nation-state's development.  If you want a breakdown of how we get to socialism, I can give that to you. If you're asking me to explain how socialism would work within capitalism, you need to go back and figure out what socialism actually is and try again. If you're asking what ""policies"" I would want in a socialist territory - again, that varies from tendency to tendency, not all of which include a state. You need to rephrase the question, because I have no idea what you're trying to ask me.  &gt;For me as a capitalist that is very easy, i want private property and free markets in terms of policy.  Ironically, this is extremely vague.  Define ""free markets,"" because socialist ""free market"" economies exist, e.g. mutualism, though they reject things like wage labor (which is directly counter to anything resembling freedom) and private ownership of capital (which is authoritarian).  &gt; private property  define private property, because a CD collection is pretty different from a precious metals mine that hasn't left the same family in ten generations.  &gt; I dont say a word about the actual outcome of this.

Broadly, we organize ourselves into a cohesive power bloc in worker's syndicates, unions, etc. This is achieved through educating other proles through things like social insertion work. We then wield our labor power to engage in work stoppages, forcing the state and capital to meet our demands for better treatment. Eventually the state will attack.

Abolish the Senate and expand the number of MPs. Elections should be on a proportional basis with a single-transferable vote.  &gt;During peacetime, the defence force should be limited to 20,000 active personnel and 50,000 reservists. Nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and testing of such weapons must be banned from Australia and her waters. All foreign military personnel must be expelled.  &gt;Investment in or by hostile regimes such as China, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Iran, Russia, or the United States must be banned until such a time as those countries conform to the values of liberty, republicanism, and socialism.  &gt;Capitalists who have or attempt to outsource all or part of their company or who attempt to offshore their funds are to be sanctioned, with the company possibly being collectivised. Capitalists with dual-citizenship who attempt to outsource, or offshore their funds are to be sanctioned, deported, and theirs assets seized.  &gt;All nonviolent offenders, with the exception of white-collar crime and politicians convicted of gross political corruption are to be paroled. Legal reform should be a high priority.  &gt;Every effort should be made to relieve the tax burden on the working class and to ensure the health and eventual expansion of our social programmes.  &gt;Environmental restrictions must be passed and vigorously enforced. Progressive restrictions culminating in an eventual ban of oil, petrol, natural gas, and coal for the majority of uses.  &gt;A right to free expression, freedom of conscience, and free protest must be explicitly included in any new constitution. The right to bear arms as well, and the gun-control policies of the Liberal and Labor governments must be reversed.  &gt;Each Australian Republic would be a federation of worker's councils, each being representative of a given canton (currently called Local Government Areas). The members of these coucils would be 2/3rds popularly elected on the same principal of parliament, with members being elected from candidates proposed by the various political parties, trade unions, and interest groups. The final 1/3rd would be reserved for members chosen by allotment, a completely random lottery drawing on the healthy adult population of the canton."

Things like more punitive tax treatment towards companies that do not offer workers stock ownership in the company, etc. Part of me is glad Trump won because I don't want a bunch of social moralizers in power, but Hillary was proposing this policy and since my own political shift, I think it's probably a sound policy that both maintains work incentives while inching the needle towards worker ownership."

Such dedication to equality of outcome they even share in the afterlife. Because sharing is caring.   &gt;take the power from the economic elite through the use of force(only way it is possible)  As quoted in Marx's Communist Manifesto. The thing about this over entitled, unethical and irrational behavior that's immorally justified as the only way to make the ""greater good"" possible - that's not what describes policy. You were way off on that one. No, that's what you call sociopathy. Comrade Skid Marx was a narcissistic sociopath. Even the most intelligent and ethical of Socialists like Nietzsche, Orwell and Zizek admit that. And anyone that agrees with that ear vomit is a sociopath.   &gt;Re-organize society, while all the rich powerfull people are in jail.  Let me guess, you think wealth is immoral right? Nevermind. Don't answer that. Socialist tears are only useful in my coffee when it isn't bitter enough. But you seem to struggle at understanding the etymology of the word policy. This isn't policy either comrade. This describes oppression. Because as you stated here ~  &gt;Offer them freedom if they are willing to adapt.....  That's the wrong use of the word offer. Because that's not freedom. Nothing about you represents freedom.  &gt;the new reality where no one suffers  Lmmfao! Which utopia is this? Yours? New? It was old the moment Marx farted the idea. Capitalism is thousands of years older, yet socialism aged and died faster than any system that was put into practice in the history of economics. It also killed more people in the shortest amount of time. 98 years and over one hundred million casualties. As for reality nothing is further from reality than Socialism. Your descriptions are grandiose. Socialism does not work because it is not consistent with fundamental principles of human behavior.  &gt;And them offer all of them   Grammar ~ the difference between knowing your shit, and knowing you're shit.   &gt;Some people may die along the way.

Just asking because I beat the living shit out of a few of them that were blocking traffic in Berkeley a few years ago. It wasn'teven fair. The shortest cartoon ever made was called Godzilla vs. Bambi . It was just like that cartoon only shorter. I'd bet my life that you dont have any hand to hand combat experience whatsoever. Nothing beyond what you've learned from your countless hours of game play on Call of Duty. Additionally, there are approximately 103 gun owners in the US. And its estimated that about 80+ million of those gun owners are conservatives (like me) and we posses over 300 million of the existing 340 million firearms in this country. Safe to say 90% of us are more than willing to protect our way of life. Our strength isnt just in numbers but the fact that we have more to lose than you, makes for a hard enemy to defeat. Nevermind the fact that because of the 2A, that group is the largest militia in all of history. You're outmanned and outgunned. Any blood thats SHED (not sheed) would be your own. But I'm not at all worried that it would go that far. Socialism is done. After 24 attempts it failed 24 times. It fell flat on it's face just like it's creator did before he died. Unfortunately Marx never had the opportunity to suffer the consequences of his own radical ideation. But it gets the award for the Shortest Lived Economic System in Human History. In all fairness it succeeded in providing equality every time. Without fail, everyone shared absolutely nothing. Their misery was equally shared too.   &gt;Its the same stuff we did to get rid of absolutist monarchy, so nothing new.  No it isn't. It's the exact opposite. It's the same shit that Feudilist Overlords did to their strifes and peasants. And it was anarchists that overthrew them. Anarchism is the proper response to your kind of fuckery.

While I agree with the ethics of socialism, I do think that the capitalists have a better understanding on human behavior and motivations.  Which is why I think you need to encourage people to become self-sufficient. This is, by itself a motivator - nobody *wants* to be a drag on others. And then, if they aren't a drag on others, they want to enjoy life - even in a world that is far from perfect. When they're no longer a cost to society, their strength not only helps others *not* be a cost on society (through general economic activity), but ultimately allows them to invest part of any growth *beyond* self-sufficiency into direct assistance for others.

As the profit margins of business is squeezed, worker co-ops become increasingly competitive and take over the US economy 3. As cooperatives become more powerful, their interests become more and more important, creating a feedback loop. More co-ops leads to co-op interests being represented more leading to more successful co-ops. 4. When co-ops dominate a region, they will reorganize the government of that region to be more directly democratic, rather than representative. 5. Co-ops will form co-op blocks with one another and trade goods and services through co-ops without using money. For example, a clothing co-op and a farming co-op make a deal that the clothing co-op gives the farming co-op all the clothing they will ever need or want, and the farming co-op gives the clothing co-op all the food they will ever need or want. 6. As co-ops become more and more integrated with one another, money will be used less and less. If you are a member of a big group of co-ops, your ID will let you just walk into a co-op store and take whatever you could want, with the understanding that on their off hours, they will get a similar service at your workplace. 7. As people become more and more productive, it becomes increasingly easy to fulfill your obligations to the other cooperatives. The working hours will shrink until they vanish completely. At that point robots will be doing all the work.  Of course this is mostly in the far future. The important part is at the beginning with the SocDem policies. If the conditions are right for a revolution then the revolutionary government can hasten this progression, but it is important that the workers, rather than any government, controls the workplace. Once co-ops become the common economic unit, they should take over politics. I don't believe there is one right way to go about socializing a country, but there are definitely wrong ways."

At a fundamental level, I believe personal accountability must be a component of every society worth it's salt - that is both why workers should keep the fruits of their labors, and why sometimes, it's not oppression that shitty things have happened to you.  I've made bad decisions in my life. I've hurt myself. It's sucked. Going through some shit right now. But it's bullshit for me to turn around and blame ""society"" for actions that were, at the end of the day, mine. The rush to blame every external force but not one internal, individual act by socialists, is easily one of its biggest turnoffs."

I dont think you even understand the fundamental principles of your very own socioeconomics.

And that's precisely why I'm buying one as soon as it hits the market. As an owner/operator it will increase my profits with the money I'll save. The only thing automation will effect in my industry is the need for team driving. Which is fine because companies are hurting for drivers anyway. Those trucks will cause more routes to be filled and will help drive prices down and increase the profit margin for carriers. There isn't one damn thing about those trucks that will have a negative impact. Sales will go down for Diesel tricks, but that's a good thing. It's called competition- which is what makes Capitalism so progressive.   Automation of semi trucks will still require someone to be in the driver seat to back up, dock, maneuver, take over the wheel in city limits and construction zones, and take over in the case of bad weather. It will likely be that way for 85 years. And even then - drivers will still be needed in the cockpit for secure loads and hazmat.

My main goal is ending poverty, giving people equal opportunity, and giving people the freedom to work on whatever they want without having to worry about affording basic human needs (food, housing, healthcare). The easiest and fairest way to do this is via a strong safety net (eg. universal healthcare) and universal basic income, funded by a land value tax and taxes on negative externalities (Pigovian taxes).

Just to satiate OP's question though, I'll try from the Anarchist perspective. This is based on a model, or policy if you will, of voluntary socialism. This means that people within a community stick to the ideas of   1. Decentralized decision making bodies  2. Immediate recall from those decision making bodies.  3. Avoiding heirarchacal forms of authority in any manner.   The rest goes from there, there are too many schools of thought and I agree that this is a bit of a loaded question. It's up to the people within the community to decide what their policies are going to be based on the outcomes they want.

I mean, free markets created super powers out of farmers, too. They also created a fairer government with greater respect for individual liberty - I know there's a lot of shit thrown America's way, I'll mince no words: I'd way the fuck rather be tried in an American court than in a Soviet one. I'd way rather live under the written American Constitution than the Soviet one which changed every five years. Etc.

That shouldn't be a controversial observation - it *must* have an authoritarian state, unless you happen to have a populace whose dreams and hopes in life happen to perfectly align with your five year plans. As the chances of this (especially with populations measured in the hundreds of millions) are astronomically small, you must use force.   Capitalist economies are fairly variable in terms of the political statement that they develop in, because the key is protection of private property. Democracies can do that, as well as can dictatorships.  But you can't have a central plan AND give people rights - they might choose not to abide by the plan, and too much individualism makes the plan ultimately meaningless. People are not individuals under a command economy, they are chess pieces who belong to the state and to the grand designs of the executive. They are not people with hopes and dreams, they are tools for the interests of the state and the politicians with power.  Also, command economies are shittier at allocating resources efficiently compared to competitive price systems, so I'm wondering what the payoff is for the ""exchange"" of rights.  &gt;That's a broad generalization   I don't often think broad generalizations are useful - but there are some sticking points in my ideology. Broadly, I am not supportive of wild government control of the economy. I don't think the state is eminently more preferable to billionaires just because the mob wills it."

The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population. Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education).

Well, the most obvious example would be to build coalitions both outside and within the political system. You can make coalitions with anti-war groups, progressive groups, anti-monopolist elements, etc. whatever is an expression of dissent against the ruling class. You organise rallies, public events, seminars and educational weekends, publish newspapers and use potential electoral success to agitate on a larger platform.  The building of dual power concretely appears during revolutionary moments. Suddenly next to the liberal parliaments an alternative people's council pops up. You could have people's hospitals next to regular hospitals. You can set up soup kitchens to feed people in case there is a shortage. Or, next to regular corrupted unions, you set up revolutionary unions. It all depends on the situation and the conditions available.

He literally sent out royal judges to bring other courts into line. It was an attempt to improve centralised state control, and it worked.   This all happened after the Norman invasion, Henry II was French, and at best only a few features of Anglo-Saxon law were incorporated.  As for 'competing' judges, it sounds like you're trying to make it sound like a legal free market, which it certainly was not.

If you have a capitalist system, you will inevitably have monopolization and artificial scarcety. There are some ways to break this, among others is the creation of competition. This is the minimal case that is often done implicitly today. We also do a lot of direct investment, albeit also under the table: Build me a jet fighter, signing bonus is the amount necessary for setting up the production. The best example of all is China. Why did China woop our western asses in the Tech sector? Not because of cheap labour. It is because Chinese government banks bankrolled the necessary education, R&amp;D and production for decades without any hope for profit. Now, they lead the world. Arguably, even rezoning is a form of direct investment.   Every government does econometrics, so what I am proposing is actually quite simple. Instead of flooding the money market or making certain special incentives,  you just do it directly. Want to expand solar power without causing hyperinflation (which would be a result of importing it from china)? Build a solar-cell factory. Need microchips for secure communication: build them. Frankly speaking, you could have a completely free market otherwise. Keynes was  was writing a lot about this which in effect is what was implemented in the New Deal to a lesser extant. Economically speaking, direct investments in production and infrastructure are pretty equal. Not to make this too long, but the compromise was political which relegated Keynes to infrastructure and war.   Why is that a system? Sorry for being unclear: it implies totality. So that means you look at the inputs and outputs as goods and are doing macroeconomic optimization. As already argued, this is mathematically a fun little task but irl problematic.

Private protection agencies and courts would have to follow law. Entire anarcho libertarian system includes: not only the abolition of the State, but also the general adoption of a libertarian law code.   Under archy, we have no safeguards whatever against those criminals who manage to constitute the designated government; under anarcho-capitalism, the mass of victims and consumers could and would hire their own competing agencies to defend them against the predators. Under libertarian anarchism, the noncriminal public would have defenders to turn to against criminal predators; under archy, they have no defense whatever against the compulsory monopoly of government predation.  Under libertarian anarchism, moreover, there would be further built-in reasons to expect the victims and their defenders to win out. For, in contrast to the situation where government exists, these predators would have no sense of legitimacy among the public, no built-in support that the State commands for its alleged wisdom, sovereignty, etc. The aggressors would be recognized by all as bandits and treated accordingly.  As government police have become increasingly inefficient, consumers have been turning more and more to private forms of protection. There are also private guards, insurance companies, private detectives, and such increasingly sophisticated security equipment. Consumers already spend billions on private security. There are more security guards than police officers in USA and most countries in world."

Proof: in EU we have plenty of safety checks on food and it's costing usually way less than in the US. I can have a half a kg of super-safe pasta for less than 1 dollar. We're literally speaking of dimes vs lifes.  That's like 4x the price in the EU than it is in the states. In the US we can buy 1 lb, which is over 2kg of pasta for $1. I think you're trying to nitpick examples here. Grains are one of the most stable and durable staple foods that exist, which is why most people aren't worried about pasta, they're worried about certain higher risk vegetables and meats/seafood.  &gt;most people would probably not touch a phone if they knew people died for mining the materials in that actual phone.  Some people would not touch the phone, but most don't care even a little bit. Hell, in the US black people will pay $300 for Nike shoes despite knowing that Nike was caught with literal slaves to make those shoes. Despite people complaining about the same things with Nestle, people still pick Nestle to make their chocolate for the holidays.   &gt;Also how are litium batteries involved in fighting CC?  If you don't know enough about batteries and their use in fighting climate change, then you're not educated enough on the topic to make it worthwhile for me, so let's just keep to the topic already at hand.  &gt;Actions have multiple causes and cannot be used to judge ""caring"".

TheRedFlaco,2020-01-13 15:56:40,fe8ub0k,t3_en6c6g,t1_fe00i86,"&gt; Because currently it is compulsory to pay taxes, the government will extort the money from you if you refuse to pay.   Ok but is this not true for things like rent, employment and other things requiring terms of service under capitalism? If you want to do do things on another property you have to follow their rules.  &gt;It is immoral for govt to provide social services because rights to education and food are not rights.   This would depend on ones own moral framework, Also those things are not rights under our current system, that can change.  &gt;Those rights would be positive rights, meaning you would be entitled to be taught and be fed. Where as negative rights only require you to take it upon yourself to not intrude on others. In other words, all rights are (or should be) negative rights.  Why should they be? Letting people go without food or education seems like the immoral thing to me, voluntary or not.  &gt;To enforce a positive right, the government would have to take the services/goods from one person and give it to another. If voluntary, this would just be a typical charity and therefore has no reason to be a government service.  One doesn't normally get depraved of something but instead loses excess money, Providing the right to education has not taken that right from anyone.  And we all know the failures of charity to address societal problems.  &gt;Of course there are always special cases, like a child being deprived of an education (e.g. reading/writing/maths bare minimum) or food has the right to be protected because they can't help themselves.   To what point can one not help themselves where would you cut them off?  &gt;For the most part, the government should only intervene in altercations where conflict has arisen between people. There are also circumstances where people must be protected from themselves, if they are harming themselves or harming animals for example.  I agree these are all things the government should do."
fmmg44,2020-01-13 15:58:28,fe8uk3h,t3_eo338y,t1_fe8178q,"&gt;a lot of people don't know Marx believed that capitalist would eventualy discover that they didnt have the right information to make good economical descisions and they would start working togheter more and more eventualy leading to a planned economy withour revolution.    Marx didn't  believe anything. He analyzed human history with a dialectical point of view, meaning that he analyzed how it changed because of contradictions. He came to the conclusion, that human history is a history of class relations and that the socioeconomic system and social relations would change after contradictions that were inherent to that system changed, mostly through a revolution. (There is a materialist aspect of his philosophy, where he explains that the contradictions would arise after the Material conditions improved. These would improve by advancements of technology)  He then used a dialectical analysis to understand capitalism and predict the contradictions that would arise in it. Although he said, that socialism would arrive after capitalism, he was only able to make rough predictions of how socialism would look like.   Marx was no economist, he became with his Magnum Opus *Capital* one of the fathers of economics, but he only criticized capitalism and didn't create an economic system.  Lenin used marxian analysis in his country and in his time period to find the best way to a society without contradictions *communism* and created *Marxism-leninism*. Mao used marxist analysis and expanded Lenins ideas to create his version of socialism for his time period in his country (*Marxism-Leninism-Maoism*)  Socialism and marxism specifically aren't some system with specific rules, it's a form to interpret society and look at it's contradictions, that's why many philosophers came to different conclusions. ML and MLM are just some of the vast number of different  interpretations of Marx and his analysis of capitalism.  Sorry for my English"

I do think though, if hundreds of people are looking to me to perform some duty for a group, and they're transparent, I guess i could see reason to help  Thinking on it more though, with so many people demanding something, it makes me think possibly it might change the scenario. But ya..  Thing is though it comes back again to, I just need to have some say, consent, and some info! haha  Im beginning to see I think what your point is. I agree it is very important to consider one's beliefs and intentions, then the real life consequences. I can only say, it's very important to think execution through.. as both capitalists and socialists know! In this case, whoever set up the voting system for this made a pretty bad one.

I can't think of any governments that would exist after actual socialism has been realized. The socialist or communist in Mao's China and Lenin's Russia saw that the government would never allow socialism to exist so they supported taking control of the government thinking they could reign it in. I'm guessing the fact that power gets addicted to itself (the same reason why a goverment would not survive actual socialism) is the reason for gulags and other murderous actions by these regimes. What we have seen so far are grotesque failed attempts at socialism.   I think we are very arrogant if we do not acknowledge that something like socialism will take generations to achieve. If it happens it will probably start in a nation where people have a constitution that forces the government to adhere to the will of the people and the workers have many many guns to shoot whatever passes for government if or when it does what governments always do.

You are welcome to change my mind.  &gt;So people claiming they do care... well that becomes our best evidence for them caring.  I guess I simply disagree that people claiming to care is sufficient to proving that they actually care. It's socially popular to care, and socially negative to not care (about humanitarian issues at least). So there is incentive to claim to care, even when you don't. Think of it like claiming to believe in God in a highly religious area, where admitting that you are an atheist can lead to social ostracization.

It's dimes vs lives.  &gt; At this point, all I can say firmly is that you're right that food in Poland is cheaper for the same product.   so we agree!  On that fact at least.  &gt; Most people know that Nike and Nestle don't have good human rights track records, they have smart phones, and are more than capable of looking into it, and yet, every day, they don't do it.   yeah, and maybe the ones buying their products are those who don't. I for one avoid these brands.  For exactly that reason.  &gt;  I don't think that I am wrong to assert that them not caring enough to look into it is the same as them simply not caring.   looking into it requires suspicion, which in turn requires information, which is not really available on mainstream media, in particular for those who just watch the sport channels and soap operas. Am I wrong on this?  If so, there's a reasonable expectation for most people to not even have the suspicion. I personally can't remember how long ago I saw one such scandal, and it was most likely on facebook, shared by some anti-corporatist contact of mine.  &gt; I guess I simply disagree that people claiming to care is sufficient to proving that they actually care.  I'd not say it's sufficient. But I'd not say that most of the people saying it are lying. After all, if marketers try to appeal to that, it's because people do act out of caring. Just not 100% of them.  &gt; So it probably helps that our discussion is about a fairly small disagreement about the severity of differences in how a policy shapes our habits.  Believe me, no difference is small enough for an uncivil person to start namecalling. I speak from experience!"

GruntledSymbiont,2020-01-13 17:16:00,fe9a5r4,t3_ensgs7,t1_fe5pcci,"&gt;Planning implies a system.  Command economy is the most common used name for a planned economy as in the economic system distinct from a market economy and I prefer it now in these discussions since it causes less misunderstanding. Think of it in these terms. Socialist command economics concentrates economic decision making with workers by taking it away from consumers. Fewer people are doing the planning than under market economics. Those relative few are commanding allocation of scarce resources.  &gt;That you look at inputs and outputs and run optimization algorithms.  Insufficient information for a useful calculation. It's like trying to do book keeping with the barter system. You can only measure raw quantities. You can't measure the true economic value of either the inputs or outputs so your information will be useless. Maybe you need to reduce output and increase quality for maximum benefit to end users. Maybe your entire production should be shut down and machinery repurposed elsewhere. Raw inputs and outputs won't tell you this. By the time you devise a system that gathers enough information to be useful you'll be surprised to realize we re created a market economy.  There is also not enough computing power on earth to solve this problem for the whole economy and the numbers you spit out will provide correct economic guidance about as often as a broken clock shows the correct time.  The problem is how to continuously rebalance and reprioritize limited resources for greatest social satisfaction.  &gt;this can be mathematically proven to be superior to any other system  No, it can't. The problem is much more complicated than you seem to appreciate. It's like trying to solve the traveling salesman problem times a billion billion and run that calculation several billion times a day. Crazy difficult optimization problem. Every economic command decision you make has unforeseeable and unintentional consequences that cascade up and down the supply chain. Even simple things like growing crops are actually complicated. Industrialized agriculture without which billions will die depends on a very complicated supply chain with tens of thousands of specialized companies.  &gt; but it also requires total knowledge of consumption behavior and is mathematically rigid.  Impossible with human beings. Maybe you can invent a new race of networked cyborgs content to behave in constant, predictable fashion.  &gt;The state acting as a investment company is something very different. It is the natural combination of trust busting and Keynesian economics. Frankly speaking, this what I am advocating here barely qualifies as democratic socialism.  Governments lack both the ability and incentive to make wise investment decisions. They have irresistible incentive to steal and prioritize funding and resources to cronies and supporters. When the state becomes the sole source of investment it's the precursor to consistent Venezuela magnitude economic disaster.   Some other important functions of market economics that we forget about because it functions so smoothly: cooperation, mediation, moderation, and dispute resolution.  If you switch to a command economy you will be shocked at how rancorous, persistent, and intractable every economic disagreement becomes. So much conflict is unleashed and political intrigue descends to a true life and death struggle for economic control at gunpoint."

Its on the Capitalists for failing to grasp the theory and insisting their idea of X authoritarian hellhole *secretly* being what all Socialists actually desire but can't openly talk about.   What Marx says about Capitalism is that it rests primarily on a function of exchange value. The more exchange, the more value, the better the economy. From an early-stage Industrial society, this is exactly what you need to promote growth and investment, in a society in which the issues most people have stem from basically a lack of access to general stuff. Think your peasant farmer in the 1800s migrating to the cities to work in a factory, at least they will have a regular supply of money with which to buy bread and maybe some clothes, rather than being stuck out in the farmlands scraping together acorns for sustenance in hard times out of their control, having to make clothes and most of whatever else they need by their own hand.   A society that promotes exchange in general in this kind of environment rapidly allows for accumulation of capital and development of the kinds of powers of production we see today, those smallhold peasant fields now are giant landscapes of monoculture tended to by robots and machines, the grotty shit-filled city is now a shining metropolis of glass and steel.  But exchange doesn't *necessarily* meet needs. Having *lots of stuff* doesn't necessarily mean all of that stuff is actually all that useful, or that things that are actually materially useful are recognized as such by the processes that drive the economy. This is Marx's criticism of Capitalism. There are no underlying motives within Capitalism to *actually meet people's needs in the way they want* other than whatever allows you to keep on exchanging all that stuff and taking that bit of profit from each exchange. If you're talking disposable one-use stuff, food, packaging, so many small-scale consumables we all rely on today that just would not have existed back in the 1800s its fucking amazing... When you're talking more niche things that only a small group of people are ever actually going to use, and then maybe once or twice? Nah not so much. Its why you see countries like the US where this socioeconomic system is so entrenched, where things like food are so insanely abundant and affordable you are literally more likely to eat yourself to death than to starve (think of that in the context of human history), but then to get yourself life-saving medical treatment will literally bankrupt you and ruin your life financially even if the disease doesn't get you physically... The means to actually produce these interventions exist, the actual physical material cost of actually doing these things often isn't all that great in terms of what modern industrial technology is capable of doing, but the lack of demand means these avenues just aren't explored enough to provide the benefits that mass-production can and should bring."

It does not just have unfettered capitalism. They use this to promote growth and to give them leverage in world markets (i.e. to break US hegemony).   Socialists don't deny that capitalism is effective at building productive forces. Remember that china was a semi-feudalistic country when it had it's revolution and so it never experienced full capitalistic developement. Most socialiats expected revolution in more fully developed countries like the UK or Germany (germany had a failed revolution) as they had a stronger proletariat (the most revolutionary class).   However China and the USSR were less developed, semi-feudalistic countries with a much larger peasantry (hence Lenin's NEP to promote growth of the economy). I think China is employing the strategy that it does because it is the best one to beat the US. It ahould ne noted that many socialiats are very critical of the current Chinese system.

OverlordMorgoth,2020-01-13 18:16:31,fe9mdiz,t3_ensgs7,t1_fe9jnmj,"* Game theory. Two villages have each a foundry and trade with each other. If one doesn't mandate filters it makes the product cheaper. So to stay competitive, the other village does the same. Now nothing has changes save that the whole county is polluted to high heaven. This little calculation functions on all levels. So the question is: how to prevent this? You need a regulatory body that covers the macroeconomy in question and enforces standards. More common name for this: race to the bottom.  * People vs. Capital: Smaller communities can easily be dominated by one industry or even factory. So the question is: do what the factory owner commands or the factory owner will leave. No unions, no ecology, no etc. You need a large enough system to be able to stare down the factory owner. Hence a socialist island in a capitalist sea is impossible, much like capitalist islands in a feudalist sea were impossible.  * Regulatory capture: A village doesn't have the resources to fun their own EMA. Trust the companies and die or have a larger system that has the resources to run the EMA.  * Externalities: My little village can dump uranium into the river. The one downstream? Fuck them.      The minimal version of this reply but hopefully you do get the gist of the problem. Different things need to be regulated on different levels. Some, can be administered on a communal level, others need the opposite. The idea of ""Every community for themselves"" is a very old one and has been debunked from all angles save if you wish to follow some radical-primitivist ideologies (and even then game theory debunks that).      Now, I also wish to add my appreciation for you little attempt at straw-manning here. Violence always does bring up the image of some Gestapo goons showing up at your door. I live in a well regulated European city and trust me, no goons to be seen. And the 'violence' that I experience daily is clean water, good internet, no asbestos, safe food etc. If that is 'violence', count me in."

I mean, surely we could agree that at least some people who are aware of certain companies human rights violations, and still choose to consume their products anyway.  I don't want to go in circles on this, but my anecdotal experience in America is that most people don't care. It may be different elsewhere, where rampant self-obsession hasn't destroyed society. But I don't have the data. If you have data on this topic, I'll be happy to look through it, but otherwise, I think I am much more blackpilled on the state of society than you are, and I think it's going to prevent us from convincing each other.  &gt;looking into it requires suspicion, which in turn requires information, which is not really available on mainstream media, in particular for those who just watch the sport channels and soap operas. Am I wrong on this?  You're correct on this. My info is all anecdotal.  &gt;But I'd not say that most of the people saying it are lying.  Absolutely agreed. I don't think people are necessarily lying, and certainly aren't trying to be malicious in any way. I think people just often haven't spent a lot of time internalizing their own belief structures, and so it leads to bizarre situations where they claim to hate slavery, but also allow information about Nestle having slave camps in South America to go in one ear and out the other especially since they really don't feel like paying a few bucks extra for halloween or christmas candy. Same deal with other people who claim to hate single use plastics, but damn, if they don't find those bottled water packs convenient to the point where they still buy them. Same with lots of religious people who violate biblical commands on a variety of things.  People aren't lying, but they are weak when it comes to certain things, and they don't mean ill intent by any of it. They just don't think about it most of the time. In the moment, they probably really do care, but tomorrow, without someone in front of them to question them, they might just not think about it."

Jasko1111,2020-01-13 18:37:09,fe9qogf,t3_enpysk,t1_fe9iwfo,"Are you asking me when the streets are private how traffic rules will work?  Here is answer:  &gt; ...The principle that property is administered by its owners also provides the rebuttal to a standard argument for government intervention in the economy. The argument holds that “after all, the government sets down traffic rules—red and green lights, driving on the right-hand side, maximum speed limits, etc. Surely everyone must admit that traffic would degenerate into chaos if not for such rules. Therefore, why should government not intervene in the rest of the economy as well?” The fallacy here is not that traffic should be regulated; of course such rules are necessary. But the crucial point is that such rules will always be laid down by whoever owns and therefore administers the roads. Government has been laying down traffic rules because it is the government that has always owned and therefore run the streets and roads; in a libertarian society of private ownership the private owners would lay down the rules for the use of their roads.  &gt; However, might not the traffic rules be “chaotic” in a purely free society? Wouldn’t some owners designate red for “stop,” others green or blue, etc.? Wouldn’t some roads be used on the right-hand side and others on the left? Such questions are absurd. Obviously, it would be to the interest of all road owners to have uniform rules in these matters, so that road traffic could mesh smoothly and without difficulty. Any maverick road owner who insisted on a left-hand drive or green for “stop” instead of “go” would soon find himself with numerous accidents, and the disappearance of customers and users. The private railroads in nineteenth-century America faced similar problems and solved them harmoniously and without difficulty. Railroads allowed each other’s cars on their tracks; they inter-connected with each other for mutual benefit; the gauges of the different railroads were adjusted to be uniform; and uniform regional freight classifications were worked out for 6,000 items. Furthermore, it was the railroads and not government that took the initiative to consolidate the unruly and chaotic patchwork of time zones that had existed previously. In order to have accurate scheduling and timetables, the railroads had to consolidate; and in 1883 they agreed to consolidate the existing 54 time zones across the country into the four which we have today. The New York financial paper, the Commercial and Financial Chronicle, exclaimed that “the laws of trade and the instinct for self-preservation effect reforms and improvements that all the legislative bodies combined could not accomplish.”  To learn more about anarcho capitalism you can read this free e book: https://mises.org/library/new-liberty-libertarian-manifesto"

As Marx theorized that in order to establish Socialism and eventually Communism there would need to be prior history of Capitalism to raise material conditions and create abundance. Marx thought that socialism would and could only arise out of an already industrialized and economically abundant nation which China was not during it's revolution. It was a nation of farmers and peasants. So the Chinese government moving towards Capitalism could be seen as a longer version of the New Economic Policy in the Soviet Union.

Conservativist,2020-01-13 20:11:36,feaaian,t3_eo338y,t1_fe9yn5j,"Good question. I think the reason is that ""orthodox"" communist (read: Marxist-Leninist) policy has a big hole when it comes to international trade, and makes foreign investment untenable for capitalists. And since trade and foreign investment bring improved living standards beyond what investments in infrastructure and health had already done up to 1978, China decided to open up its country to the world market, which meant introducing capitalist reforms.   The reason why this happens, as I alluded to, is because Marxist-Leninist governments never abolished money, and as a result it's impossible to maintain socialist relations without severely limiting trade and foreign investment (because to do otherwise would lead to foreign money being used to establish a capitalist economy within). There are proposals, for example from Cockshott and Cottrell (TANS), with a system of labor vouchers that become floating currency on the foreign market, that are designed to address this very problem by making it feasible to have socialist-capitalist relations."

It did benefit the worker so Marxism is wrong about that right?  This is exactly what Marxism predicts. It's rather the 20th century Socialist movement which has nothing to do with Marxism. The USSR had as much to do with Marxism as the Catholic Church had to do with the original teachings of Jesus.  Marxism predicts an expanded market which is an inevitable condition before the market is abolished. State based planning is not really efficient nor will lead to anywhere but decay and ultimately a reversal back to primitive capitalism (like the fall of USSR and Eastern Block).

This kinda resembles religious indoctrination. Like catholics with kid rape from priests. Would you say that a catholic wouldn't care if a kid said to him personally that a priest just raped him?

dorkcrusher51,2020-01-13 21:47:59,feathkr,t3_eo338y,t3_eo338y,"&gt; If Marxism is right that wouldn't happen right?  No that's not correct. Now I want to preface this by saying I'm not defending everything China has done, they obviously have their issues.  Marx believed capitalism did a lot of wonderful things. His works are inspired from Adam Smith's ""Wealth of Nations"" and share a lot of similar arguments.  There is this rather prevailing view that capitalism is a necessary requisite to achieve socialism. In simple terms the progression goes feudalism --&gt; mercantilism --&gt; capitalism --&gt; socialism --&gt; communism. And skipping one of these steps is a recipe for failure.  During the revolution, China was an aggrarian feudal society. The goal of the Dengist movement was to open up the economy as a way of more rapidly industrializing. You can see something similar in the post-revolution industrialization of Soviet Russia that many people have described as ""state capitalism"".  While is true that China has seen an extraordinary reduction in poverty since the Dengist market reforms (850 million out of 1 billion people lifted out of extreme poverty are from China) keep in mind that they have been able to maintain a certain degree of independence from the IMF/World Bank world order. IMO this is a big reason why other third world countries have not seen the same level of poverty reduction and industrialization as China and Russia."

Eric_VA,2020-01-13 22:22:55,feb0eto,t3_ensgs7,t1_fe8y7ps,"&gt;Or anyone who supports markets that allow for this.  No. Absolutely not. This is out of the question in any sort of learned debate on the topic. A capitalist is, and has always been an entrepreneur, investor or business owner. A non-capitalist who defends capitalism is at most an economic liberal. No one else ever means ""blue collar person who thinks this system is better"" by the word capitalist. Of course, words change meanings and if enough people start calling themselves capitalists it can catch on. But this is a new thing, and do not think for a minute that this is not purposeful confusion of the public discourse. The world of pro-market think tanks specializes in these tactics.  &gt;If I trade my car for a home remodel, that is a free market exchange.  Sorry, It is not. That is a transaction, not a market. It is only a free market exchange if it happens in a free market. Otherwise it is simply a free exchange. The example begs the question.  &gt;""Free markets"" is more of a principle than a policy. But any policy that contradicts that principle is opposed.  Then you agree with my previous comment. The point is: free markets are a first principle for some people. In the same way, social justice is someone else's first principles. This is not policy, it is ideology. Nothing wrong with it, but you cannot call it concrete.  &gt;Question: can you give your best example of a free market being ended by a monopoly?  If I'm not mistaken in my knowledge of US history, the Anti-trust law(s) were made to prevent this because it was happening with many ""trusts"" (the word meant 'big businesses' at the time).  Also, in anticipation of any argument about any big business monopolies or oligopolies existing because of some interaction with the state, remember that economic power and political power go hand in hand. There has never been a big business that didn't seek state power for the obvious reasons that such power is the best to advance private economic interests. The whole separation of ""market"" and ""state"" works only at the theoretical level, as an idealization that helps explain some things. In reality markets and governments interact constantly."

Matter decays over time, so to keep it together you need to add energy. To be able to form complex structures from simple raw materials requires work. This work is the same as [the physical notion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(thermodynamics)). It's basically just science.  So to turn metal ores into automobiles requires work, this adds value to it since the metal ore without a higher purpose has no value, it only has value if it can be turned into something useful, and to do that you need to apply labor. This means that labor imbues that material with value, hence the labor theory of value."

This is off topic, but in the US, a higher percentage of public school teachers had credible accusations of sex abuse than clergymen (6% in the public school system, vs 4% in the Catholic church). My hometown actually had an incident with a public schoolteacher and a highschooler, and I do question if the concept of church clergy abusing children is two-fold - 1) because a lot of people are bitter at the church after losing their region (I know that I was), and 2) the church did a lot of cover-ups, which reasonably makes people bitter. I'm not trying to use whataboutism, and definitely not trying to dismiss the problem, simply pointing out a frustration that people may be a bit disproportionately angry at the church, and could help more people if they focused on things that they like, such as the public school system.  &gt;Would you say that a catholic wouldn't care if a kid said to him personally that a priest just raped him?  I think they would care, but not necessarily enough to act on it, just as people care that child labor is used to make chocolate, but not enough to change their buying habits.   &gt;By your standard the donations that are given after the spotlight scandal or the pennsylvania grand jury would prove that they just don't care.

We've seen perfectly democratic presidents such as mogadesh, arbenz, allende, and morales be crushed by their propaganda and sabotage. Communist democracies, on the other hand, allow for opposing views, so long as they're not capitalist views, because they know that those just leads to above mentioned situations.  As you sit here now, you don't even realize that the survival of capitalism relies on imperialism. That's how good their propaganda machine is.   I would simply suggest searching more. You're being fed a bunch of lies. We all are. The entire history of socialism has always been deeply affected by capitalist sabotage and infiltration. Just like the invasion of the SU in 1918. Think about that. They were violently INVADED, for simply being Marxists. No previous examples (propaganda lies) of  socialist countries oppressing and murdering their citizens, as an excuse for invasion. They just didn't like the idea of a country run by the masses. That's the reality of the situation. Socialism has never existed in a vacuum. It's ALWAYS had to exist in a capitalist world."

Sanders meanwhile, is the only candidate right now whose election can lead to a quickly growing socialist movement. He’s almost certainly not going to be able to pass Medicare 4 All, or almost any other aspect of his platform. However his election will be the final nail of the fed’s complete breakdown.  This isn’t a “support Obamacare because it’ll lead to Universal healthcare that will lead to Socialism, this is “Vote Sanders because he’ll be the first real ideological opposition the liberals in power will have ever faced and will facilitate the system’s total breakdown.”  After all it’s been shown throughout history that when reform is impossible, revolution is inevitable."

The proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, by degree, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralise all instruments of production in the hands of the State, i.e., of the proletariat organised as the ruling class; and to increase the total productive forces as rapidly as possible. Of course, in the beginning, this cannot be effected except by means of despotic inroads on the rights of property, and on the conditions of bourgeois production; by means of measures, therefore, which appear economically insufficient and untenable, but which, in the course of the movement, outstrip themselves, necessitate further inroads upon the old social order, and are unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionising the mode of production. These measures will, of course, be different in different countries.*  *Nevertheless, in most advanced countries, the following will be pretty generally applicable.*  *1. Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes.*  **2. A heavy progressive or graduated income tax.**  *3. Abolition of all rights of inheritance.*  *4. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels.*  *5. Centralisation of credit in the hands of the state, by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly.*  *6. Centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the State*.  *7. Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the State; the bringing into cultivation of waste-lands, and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan.*  *8. Equal liability of all to work. Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture.*  *9. Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries; gradual abolition of all the distinction between town and country by a more equable distribution of the populace over the country.*  *10. Free education for all children in public schools. Abolition of children’s factory labour in its present form. Combination of education with industrial production, &amp;c, &amp;c.*  *- Manifesto of the Communist Party by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels*  --------------------  I do enjoy that commies reinforce the stereotype of being lazy when they can't even do their own homework on their own ideology."

If raw materials are scarce, then this is reflected in the price.  That helps encourage conservation, and the development and use of materials.  The group that controls the unobtanium wants to sell if for as high a price as possible.  This is just fine, because they are paying a high cost for the exploitation of the land to get the rare material.  But scientists across the globe have an economic incentive to find a way to replace unobtanium, or use less of it.    &gt; This group that privately owns the last remaining raw materials simply refuses to give it to the other groups..   Then the group is automatically penalized.  If Unobtanium is important to others, the group could trade it for anything else in the world.  Instead, they are the ones that are 'spending lots of money' by refusing to sell their natural resource.  They are sacrificing their own livelihood in order to keep their belief that Unobtanium can't be sold."

A text that was written in simple language to appeal to barely educated factory workers in the 19th century.  If you bothered to understand the words instead of fishing for a quote to seem snappy, you would easily see that the text enumerates general policy ideas for when the workers have already taken over the state.  This is the socialist revolutionary state that should usher in communism.  &gt;the first step in the revolution by the working class is to raise the proletariat to the position of ruling class to win the battle of democracy.   See? First phrase.  Also, you cannot just assign meanings to words randomly and out of context. Winning the battle for democracy is not winning elections in this context because Marx believed that liberal ('bourgoise') democracy was a scam. Democracy for him would only be significant if the workers ruled, and this requires revolution. This is a pamphlet about revolutions and not getting elected and raising taxes. The revolution is supposed to already be underway. Hence the ""despotic"" inroads. Revolutions are nasty businesses. Ask Robespierre."

People often cite Cuba, which does have a remarkably good healthcare system considering the circumstances, but there’s basically no political democracy, so fuck that.   I do like a lot about the economy of Finland in general—they’re doing quite well at solving homelessness, actually—and from the looks of it their healthcare functions pretty well. Finns get universal coverage, but their healthcare is administered on the municipal level. Patients do pay for their care out of pocket but it’s at relatively low, flat rates.   Finland is not a socialist country, it’s technically a social democracy, but social democracy stems from socialist thought and I happen to think a robust social democracy is the best way of transitioning to actual socialism.   88% of Finns are satisfied with their health care. Pretty good compared to most other countries!

Meaning that, for instance, the factory workers themselves are the ones who own the factories they work in, not some capitalist business man who is seeking profit. The benefit of this is that the workers who now own the factory, will receive all of the rewards from the products they produce, rather than just receiving a small portion in the form of wages while the “owner” turns a large profit.

Value lies in values, it shouldn't be hard to understand, though. Obviously persons who never read a single book of economy (hint : The Capital isn't one), are prone to confuse values and doctrine. Therefore they have no values, and it's hard to say they have a doctrine either considering they're not able to understand it. They're just brainwashed, I guess.

Frankystein3,2020-01-14 00:53:09,febviu2,t3_eoay3n,t1_febup64,"Stalin did not start WW2, but he took advantage of it. And ironically, by reassuring Hitler of the safety in the East AND sending him millions of tons of oil, rubber and other strategic resources, used not only against France (thereby getting more stockpiles) but against the USSR itself later! (see Edward E. Ericson, 1999, among others). So yes, Stalin bears HUGE responsibility for the disaster in that period. He shot himself massively in the foot due to his paranoia. Of course, he was't the one to suffer... Also, his hubris and incompetence lead to the decimation of the Red Army officers and his ineptitude led to the deaths of avoidable millions of Soviet soldiers, and consequentially civilians, in Barbarossa as well."

Those of us who are classically liberal and/or conservative or libertarian also read books and do research and form our opinions based off of discerning fact from fiction.  You should try actually making an argument, not merely making statements and then defending them with ad hominem as though you’re the only independent thinker in the room.   The problem with communism is that it assumes things contrary to human nature, namely that all will act in the best interest of the commune if given the opportunity. This is flatly untrue, as has been demonstrated in every instance of communism and socialism that has been attempted. That’s why there is a common denominator for all of those genocides listed - even if there were varying factors that led to the death and destruction, you can boil the endpoint down to the start - people tried to implement a system to force all to act in the good of the collective, but neither those in power nor those subjugated actually did. Instead they acted in their own interest. On the other hand, in classical liberalism or in economics, we start with the same assumption, that people will act in their own self interest, and then attempt to design a system that takes advantage of that human nature for good - those that provide goods and services that improve the quality of life for others generally can benefit themselves through investing capital to get a return. Is it perfect, probably not, but it is the best we have that can actually work without changing human nature."
Eric_VA,2020-01-14 01:07:21,febxuib,t3_ensgs7,t1_febcesz,"1. You cannot just torture words until they mean what you wish. A car is not an investment in a literal sense. This is just marketing speak. A car is a purchase. Your money you spend on a car is not capital, it's just money. Now the owner of a company of private transportation like luxury cabs who buys a car is making an investment because he expects returns. This is an investment and the money and the value of the car are capital.  This is not my opinion it's a matter of using the right words for the right stuff.  2. Where have I ever cited Hitler. What does this have to do with anything? You are no longer making an argument. Let me spell out for you what I meant by alluding to think tanks. There is actual evidence and actual historical and sociological and political science studies about the broad network of pro-market institutions. Cato institute, Atlas, mises institute etc. They were made to fight regulation and frequently employ dirty techniques. There's a very good work called ""merchants of doubt"" written by American historians. Look it up, it is very interesting, but it only talks about the scientific denialism part. So these institutions spent years sowing confusion in discourse to fight regulation by any means necessary. They are also linked directly to multiple libertarian parties and ""ancap"" groups. So it is perfectly *reasonable* to *suspect* that the political tactic of convincing ordinary people they are capitalists is pourposeful on their part. But there can be no doubt that, whoever came up with this, meant it as propaganda, for it is a new notion, and a very weird one.  3. Yeah, antitrust laws in the US didn't break complete monopolies. They prevented a monopoly from happening. These are regulations for the protection of free market and free enterprise. They are necessary to stop one person from killing the markets and imposing prices. That is what I said. One company having 80% of market share is ridiculous if you value free markets. Seeing as  markets are not geographically uniform, this means a de facto monopoly in many places. It is a virtual monopoly in some aspects. The laws to protect markets exist (in many countries) because without them huge companies would kill it. People prevented this on purpose, and this is not rocket science, everyone understood this at the time.  &gt;Economic power and political power go hand in hand because you have a coercive government that we're all forced to pay.   You could easily argue the opposite: that the reason is that there is economic power. Also, you use coercive like it is a given. Economic power and political power have always gone hand in hand, so you imply that every government is coercive. By this logic, democracy, republic, legitimacy and consent are rather empty concepts.  &gt;Businesses can't force us to pay without a contract but they can go to the government and use them to force us to do anything.   Really? I present you with the evidence of the obscure country known as United States (maybe you heard of it), where people are literally forced to pay for medical care. If they didn't pay, they would die. Fortunately they can get credit from a helpful bank, or buy an expensive insurance.  What's that? Are you typing ""but they are not forced to do it""? Well think for a second and you will realize that ""do it or die"" is the literal definition of being forced by any standards, including liberal, lockean or hobbesian ones. So there is a hospital and at least one financial company oppressing each patient on pain of death, by the virtue of the markets. We could fix this by simply enacting a tax and a public health service, like many capitalist countries do. We could legitimize it  by holding elections and subsequently by having an assembly of Representatives deliberate it publicly, and then have a press report back on the public mood, thus seeking the consent from which to legitimize such policy. But alas, that would clearly be ""oppressive"" and ""communistic"". People must be free to be extorted. God forbid we acknowledge that markets do not regulate everything perfectly for the common good.  &gt;Replace the state with voluntary decentralized autonomous organizations with competing constitutions.  Well very good my friend you are almost officially a communist. Congratulations comrade, turn right to get your Bakunin cap and pin, left to get your Marx t-shirt.   Only the ""competing"" part remains in the way of you becoming a fellow traveler. What does it even mean? It implies some lose and some win. So the losers... What? Disappear? Get incorporated? Get dominated? However you look at this, at least on the horizon there is the prospect of one system becoming dominant or hegemonic. So the result is either a big state or the scenario of a cyberpunk corporate dystopia. Anyway, it's not perfectly free markets."

Otherwise, it seems like you decided your opinion before you considered the subject.  EDIT: If you really want a claim- an analysis of the relationship of communist countries and the policies in them needs to have the directions clearly established. Since communism is a revolutionary ideology that appeals directly to poorer workers, it is more likely to be established in authoritarian, low-income countries. In this sense, it's not surprising that the resulting communist state would also be authoritarian and low-income. This means that an analysis of the policies of communist countries should consider if these things are endemic to the ideology, or to the state of the countries where that ideology took hold."

But even combined they don't provide nearly the reach of the government. You may believe that in the absence of a government they would step in the take up the slack but I see no reason to grant that assumption.  &gt;often for plots / problems which are much more nefarious / difficult to detect than something comparatively simple like food poisoning.  That's part of the problem, the 'simple' cases are by far the more numerous and more (in total) impactful. But dealing with them hasn't been a profitable or realistic endeavor for private interests.  &gt;There is no reason to think that, given they can invest all of these sophisticated problems, they can't investigate food poisoning.

Since communism is a revolutionary ideology that appeals directly to poorer workers, it is more likely to be established in authoritarian, low-income countries. In this sense, it's not surprising that the resulting communist state would also be authoritarian and low-income. This means that an analysis of the policies of communist countries should consider if these things are endemic to the ideology, or to the state of the countries where that ideology took hold.   I'm not sure how you got ""you can freely murder your bourgeoisie without consequence given the right economic conditions"" from that. I'm claiming that when a country has that sort of action happen in it, you need to evaluate if it's part of the environment around that country or part of the ideology present in it. As I pointed out before, the often-cited communist countries were hardly peaceable or prosperous before their revolutions- so is the continued conflict and poor economies of communist countries because communism causes or promotes those conditions, or because communism didn't fix things that already existed?"

Wars aren’t won by the heroism of the troops but by material things like numbers and production and strategy.  Many of these people believe Marxists were frustrated because of the lack of revolution in America and it was because Americans are “too moral” and “love freedom too much” for communism.

Petra-fied,2020-01-14 04:27:34,fecke32,t3_eoay3n,t1_febnl26,"I could go on about how the *Manifesto* was a shitrag written by early, undeveloped Marx for a wage, for a revolution and party that was already underway at the time. But, despite all the flaws and problems with the *Manifesto* and Marx's writings in general, the problem with your argument is far more basic.  The ""Planks of Communism"" are are a concept created by and only spoken of in right-wing circles. No one in radical circles *ever* talks about them, and beyond that, the Manifesto barely comes up.   By even briefly glancing at the surrounding context of the ""planks,"" [it becomes immediately obvious how disingenous and dishonest a construct it is](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/pdf/Manifesto.pdf#page=26). I'll briefly explain the most basic of Marx's concepts and then quote the *Manifesto* itself:  Marx defines the state as an organ of class control. He calls what we currently have the ""[Dictatorship of the Bourgeoisie](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/d/i.htm#dictatorship-bourgeois)"" (ie, Capitalists are the ruling class) which, through revolution will be replaced by the ""Dictatorship of the Proletariat"" (workers are the ruling class). Once private property is socialised and as such all people are unified and class is abolished, the state will disappear, leaving communism: a stateless, classless, capitalless and moneyless society.  So now, let's read a tiny part of the *Manifesto* (emphasis mine, from page 26):  &gt; We  have  seen  above,  that  **the  first  step  in  the  revolution**  by  the  working  class  is  to  raise  the  proletariat to the position of ruling class to win the battle of democracy.   &gt; The  proletariat  will  use  its  political  supremacy  to  wrest,  by  degree,  all  capital  from  the  bourgeoisie,  to  centralise  all  instruments  of  production  in  the  hands  of  the  State,  **i.e.,  of  the  proletariat  organised  as  the  ruling  class**;  and  to  increase  the  total  productive  forces  as  rapidly  as  possible.    &gt; Of  course,  in  the  beginning,  this  cannot  be  effected  except  by  means  of  despotic  inroads  on  the  rights  of  property,  and  on  the  conditions  of  bourgeois  production... *These measures will, of course, be different in different countries.*  Nevertheless, **in most advanced countries, the following will be pretty generally applicable:**  &gt; [planks]   *This* is what the ""planks"" actually are- real-world, of-the-time, practical goals, designed only for the developed world of the time, to create a *Dictatorship of the Proletariat,* not communism. These are not all-hallowed policies that Marx wanted for their own sake, nor things that even begin constitute communism. They are simply throwaway practical ideas for the time.  Now this comment is not meant to be an unambiguous defense of Marx, Marx was a fucking idiot and there is a *fuckton* that one can legitimately critique about Marx's conceptions here and elsewhere, but the ""planks of communism"" are simply a dishonest hack-job, usually invoked to compare the most milquetoast of centrism to an actual radical left."

For example:  &gt; Communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to be established, an ideal to which reality [will] have to adjust itself. We call communism the real movement which abolishes the present state of things. The conditions of this movement result from the premises now in existence. (German Ideology)  Marx believed that science or the progress of man would potentially lead humanity to the point, if given the right provocation or forcing, to where a Communist ideal could be established. But he felt this way because he believed:  &gt; History calls those men the greatest who have ennobled themselves by working for the common good; experience acclaims as happiest the man who has made the greatest number of people happy. (Reflections of a Young Man)  and:  &gt; If we have chosen the position in life in which we can most of all work for mankind, no burdens can bow us down, because they are sacrifices for the benefit of all; then we shall experience no petty, limited, selfish joy, but our happiness will belong to millions, our deeds will live on quietly but perpetually at work, and over our ashes will be shed the hot tears of noble people. (Reflections of a Young Man)  For communism to succeed, the above has to be true, but unfortunately for human nature, it often is not. Sometimes working most of all for mankind, doesn’t in fact leave people free of burden. It is this ideology that I’m referring to as the baseline upon which the Communist ideal rests. So, while he maybe didn’t phrase it in the way I did, he believed some form of that."

Seeing von Neumann's mind at work, Eugene Wigner wrote, ""one had the impression of a perfect instrument whose gears were machined to mesh accurately to a thousandth of an inch."" Paul Halmos states that ""von Neumann's speed was awe-inspiring."" Israel Halperin said: ""Keeping up with him was ... impossible. The feeling was you were on a tricycle chasing a racing car."" Edward Teller admitted that he ""never could keep up with him"". Teller also said ""von Neumann would carry on a conversation with my 3-year-old son, and the two of them would talk as equals, and I sometimes wondered if he used the same principle when he talked to the rest of us."" Peter Lax wrote ""Von Neumann was addicted to thinking, and in particular to thinking about mathematics"".  Now, if you weren't a moron, you might recognize some of those names.

I'm not telling you what to say, what I'm saying is that if you're using a word like ""retarded"" in order to dismiss someone, that perhaps you're subconciously contributing to one particular axis of the class structure.

The unspoken irony is that for as much as libertarians bitch about ""positive versus negative"" rights, private property is itself a positive right through an through.  Factories are recognized as private property by the state. If the workers, who actually *work* in the factory try to seize the full wealth of *their* labor, then government goons show up to torture and murder them en masse in order to support their fucking bourgeois masters. Stockholders don't actually do anything for the companies they run, instead they just passively collect money, and they're allowed to do such because, again, the state recognizes their property rights.  It's natural and human to use the land you're surrounded with. If workers labor day in and day out to produce, for example, steel beams, and their boss takes the lion's share of the wealth produced by *their* labor, such a thing is only possible because of the coercive influence of the state. Because the truth is that fucking bourgeois son of a bitch couldn't actually run the factory by himself, he couldn't even defend his property rights by himself, he goes running to daddy government to save him the second workers talk about taking what's rightfully theirs.

For example:  &gt;Communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to be established, an ideal to which reality \[will\] have to adjust itself. We call communism the real movement which abolishes the present state of things. The conditions of this movement result from the premises now in existence. (German Ideology)  Marx believed that science or the progress of man would potentially lead humanity to the point, if given the right provocation or forcing, to where a Communist ideal could be established.""  No, Marx here is saying that Communism is the embodiment of proletarian class struggle in a capitalist society. He literally says right in the text you quote that it is not an ideal, and what, you decide to disregard the text in front of you to maintain a silly assumption? Juvenile.  ""But he felt this way because he believed:  &gt;History calls those men the greatest who have ennobled themselves by working for the common good; experience acclaims as happiest the man who has made the greatest number of people happy. (Reflections of a Young Man)  ...  For communism to succeed, the above has to be true, but unfortunately for human nature, it often is not....""  Marx *never* asserts that so much must be true for communism to succeed, he is talking about his personal conceptions of happiness and greatness. These philosophical musing are in no way necessary prerequisites of Marx's descriptive theories.  ""Sometimes working most of all for mankind, doesn’t in fact leave people free of burden. It is this ideology that I’m referring to as the baseline upon which the Communist ideal rests. So, while he maybe didn’t phrase it in the way I did, he believed some form of that.""

dog_snack,2020-01-14 09:55:53,fed2omx,t3_eocg7p,t1_fed29ii,"(Note: I have to get to bed so I won’t answer anything until morning)  Here, I’ll repost something I posted in another thread a couple weeks ago (edited slightly):  Fascism is, by nature, a slippery and opportunistic thing, so it’s difficult to nail down a universal hard definition.   I tend to think of it as one of two paths a society can take once regular-degular liberalism collapses: the rightmost path when the road forks. The other one being socialism or more generally leftism.   Robert Paxton has this to say:  &gt;Fascism may be defined as a form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal constraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion.  The YouTuber Vaush characterizes it as a rejection of Enlightenment values, which boil down to “hey, maybe strict hierarchy in society is something to be skeptical of, huh?” as well as “hey, how about this secular philosophy and scientific method?”. Fascists want to go back to the categorization of people and the doling out of political agency based on it. And they only way that can really happen is through tyranny, of course. Probably including genocide, though the modern fascist would probably deny that. That’s the thing too: because secular philosophy and science forms the basis of what is usually considered “the truth” nowadays, the fascist is likely to conclude that the truth doesn’t matter, and thus they’ll lie and manipulate like a motherfucker to get people on their side.   Umberto Eco’s essay “Ur-Fascism” has been quite influential in our modern understanding of fascism. In it, he [lays out 14 key features](http://www.openculture.com/2016/11/umberto-eco-makes-a-list-of-the-14-common-features-of-fascism.html):   &gt;**The cult of tradition.** “One has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements.”  &gt;**The rejection of modernism.** “The Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.”  &gt;**The cult of action for action’s sake.** “Action being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation.”  &gt;**Disagreement is treason.** “The critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge.”  &gt;**Fear of difference.** “The first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.”  &gt;**Appeal to social frustration.** “One of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups.”  &gt;**The obsession with a plot.** “The followers must feel besieged. The easiest way to solve the plot is the appeal to xenophobia.”  &gt;**The enemy is both strong and weak.** “By a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.”  &gt;**Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy.** “For Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle.”  &gt;**Contempt for the weak.** “Elitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology.”  &gt;**Everybody is educated to become a hero.** “In Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death.”  &gt;**Machismo and weaponry.** “Machismo implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.”  &gt;**Selective populism.** “There is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.”  &gt;**Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak.** “All the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.”"

The entire strata of the bourgeois is a parasite class reliant on the proletariat to make it's wealth.  &gt;The thing is, you start saying that private property is ensured by the state and that argument is weak af. You don't need a state to have private property, that's just your opinion.  You literally do. Without a state to provide military and the rule of law your private property deed means jack shit. Which means either ""your"" property is something you physically have to defend yourself, which will ensure it'll never grow beyond the size of a house and thus capitalism cannot function, or you fall into the libertarian trap of ""Oh well we'll just have competing firms offer private property deeds.""  In which case private property becomes remarkably inefficient as you'd have multiple firms competing over the right to a parcel of land. And before you say ""Well we'll have some kind of mediator in such cases"", that mediator exists already: it's the capitalist state.  &gt;And don't start with the exploitation shit, if you are owner of a factory you have the right to hire people to help you make your product or service, there's something you communists forget when talking about exploitation, in capitalism we have something called contracts that exists to make sure that the work is made voluntarily and for the benefit of both: the owner gets help and the employee gets a cut of the profit in advance.  Except the owner is still parasitically subsisting off your labor. You'll talk a big game about rights but you deny workers the right to self-determine by ruthlessly defending the property rights of the bourgeois.  &gt;So, if the workers of a factory have a contract they're not being exploited buddy, cause they agreed on it and they can get out whenever they want.  Contracts mean jack shit. McDonalds employees sign a contract, it isn't because ""Well I *want* to work for McDonalds"" but because of systemic economic pressures.  &gt;You gotta miss some important books to say all that shit (unless you blame it on being drunk) cause you are clearly misunderstanding some basic concepts about private property, go read some John Locke and then come back.

Bayer, which is from Germany, a country with a public/private option system, is one of the richest and most innovative pharmaceutical corporations in the world.  &gt;Only free-market systems such as the US innovate cures as efficiently and effectively as possible. Basically, US dies while socialized healthcare countries thrive.   Extremely hot take, considering even in the US, a lot of the biological and medical research is funded by the state. Australia, which has single payer and pretty much only public research in this area, is one of the most successful countries in medicine innovation. Even developing countries like Cuba, which has fully socialised healthcare in all areas, develops things like stopping transmission of HIV from mother to child.  I would not only say that capitalist free-market systems within medical research are not only a double-edged sword, they are also actively harmful in many areas, especially when they are financied by big pharma.

Many ardent socialists and communists support government intervention in the economy as closer to their ideal than the status quo, so while 'government doing stuff' isn't the definition of communism/socialism as political systems, it is something which communism/socialism as movements support, and can be blamed for when they go disastrously wrong (as they always do)."

The fact that she can prostitute herself is an additional option she has that men generally don't have, not something she is forced to do.  Boys can prostitute themselves as well.  Regardless, if we assumed zero market demand for boys, that is irrelevant. A homeless girl who prostitutes herself for food is still forced because she has two options: (1) have sex or (2) die.  Imagine this girl had a gun held to her head and she is told to have sex or she be shot. Quite simply, she is forced to have sex at gunpoint. Her choices are (1) have sex or (2) die. These are the exact same choices as the first example.  If a girl has a gun held to her head and is forced to have sex, zero market demand for boys means nothing. The girl is still being raped."

yellowsilver,2020-01-14 12:15:05,fed8yau,t3_eofqgd,t3_eofqgd,"you would probably have less rights than a socialist society for sure, just to get that out of the way, but libertairian societies still believe in contracts being enforced so it's not like it would be legal for you to be unpaid or for reasonable contracts to be voided.   on the flipside in my country, the UK, I've witnessed two things:  people being pressured or feeling pressured to not use their rights, especially when it comes to things like holiday leave, especially in small companies, because the smaller the company, the more it's vital that everyone comes to work everyday. it's not like a big company where it's easy to leave without being noticed.   people being scared of turning into small companies because the amount of rights a new employee has makes them such a risk than it is too easy for a bad hiring decision to become a massive set back.   lots of discrimination, nepotism and cronyism even though legally it's not allowed.   There's also people not knowing their rights, or knowing their rights but not being bothered to chase them up as people generally don't like being litigious.    My overall point is that even when people have lots of rights they can be unenforced or easy to work around. Lefties would say to unionise, but unions tend to start strong but end up being bad for business in the long run, with workers ending up overpaid, very likely to strike and hard to get rid of from what I've seen and researched on them, although european unions seems to have be better at cooperating with businesses. US and UK ones seem to be very aggressive.   Whilst I admitted a right lib society would have less rights, there'd probably be more employment opportunity due to less market regulations. This would mean that employers had to compete more for employees thus their being a chance of them having to treat their employees better.   oh and to address your OP specifically not everyone works for a large corp. Large corps suppress people in unions and with rights even in societies with numerous amounts of workers rights.   &gt;Then there is the fact that the corporation can hire better lawyers or can even afford a lawyer. As the employee might not be able to afford a lawyer because of decreased wages in union suppression/lack of labor laws.   no matter how many rights you have this is true of any society"

Even if they don't immediately unilaterally cut pay (in a coordinated wage-gauging effort with other employers that sane countries make illegal) or demand you suddenly work more hours with lesser concern for your safety or comfort (there isn't an employer alive who wouldn't sacrifice upkeep of safety equipment for profit margins) then you still have to face a future where they will never be incentivized to raise your wage as inflation continues to drive prices up as normal.

Obviously, this isn’t what China is doing, but just wanted to point that out. As far as China moving away from central planning to increase living standards- this isn’t as clear cut as it may seem from your question. For most of the urban working class, China still provides homes on a central planning basis, and it has moved away from this only on the higher ends of the market since those people want to buy super-fancy homes and the government doesn’t stop them.  Second, let’s take a look at “living standards.” I would never argue that under socialism we would have as many different products and goods as we do under capitalism, so if you define living standards in a purely materialist sense then I think in the long run capitalism would always have an edge. The incentives are just extremely powerful on the capitalist end for material production. However, I would argue this isn’t a true test of living standards. As I take a look at the world around me, I see more and more people fall into despair - depression, anxiety, drug addiction, loneliness fill our societies to the brim despite us having material possessions people 100 years ago would have looked at like magic. I don’t think that what gives us meaningful lives is the pursuit of more stuff to numb ourselves to the outside world, which when you look will find is at the core of much of what the capitalist world provides us today. I would argue that measuring living standards in purely material terms is already faulty.  - A democratic socialist"
Guluronate,2020-01-14 12:33:16,fed9zw1,t3_eoay3n,t1_fed3602,"I'm assuming you mean something more like Western Europe, where the situation is generally more politically stable and industrialization more ubiquitous. In that case, yep, that's true. To Marx's credit, some of those countries did take a crack at it before or near the time that the less developed ones did (e.g. the Paris commune, the Bavarian Soviet Republic, the Spartacist uprising in Berlin), but these efforts were crushed by the stronger militaries of those countries. It's possible that the political instability in the less developed countries helped prevent this- it's notable that the February Revolution happened near the end of World War I, when the Russian military was far less developed. The overall trend is mostly speculation on my part, to be fair.  Another decent explanation for this is the one that Lenin himself gives in *Imperialism*. Lenin argued that it's considerably more difficult to enfranchise the proletariat of countries that have colonial empires, because the dissolution of capitalism will lead to the dissolution of imperialism as well, meaning owning their local means of production can actually \*decrease\* the share of production gained by working people in those countries, because they lose their ability to exploit the labour of workers in foreign countries. Engels spoke of this ""opportunism"" a bit in his letters to Kautsky, but I'm not aware of Marx ever mentioning it."

Don't bother with subreddits r/communism and r/socialism those communities have skewed understanding and self-cooked-up versions it's so disturbing just yuck. A good modern example of a socialist or communist nation are China, and Russia, A good living example of Socialism in our country (USA) Is Medicare/health insurance, Public education, FDIC securities, and FAFSA.  I have my own interpretation of the economic theories here. Both are versions of utilization and sharing of resources to gain most value within an eco system. Where one is an optional infrastructure (socialism) and the other is mandatory (communism)  Capitalism is where everything has value, nothing is free, your service and content is rewarded, the service and content of others is paid for.

Production is far likelier to always be centralized, because it's vastly more efficient that way, and this is where everyone *cannot* own a means of production and where those who do live their lives off of the labors of others while fundamentally creating nothing of value to society - who simply rent seek - are exploiting the rest of us.  Where you advocate that people shouldn't get free shit just because they happen to exist and can poke food down their gullets I'm with you - but that does extend to owners. Without the assumption of risk, capital ownership is pretty hard to justify. I'm also not opposed to rich people generally - I expect that there would be managers and executives, and that these people would be paid accordingly, but I think that if you can't demonstrate that you're still extracting your reward for the risk you personally exposed yourself to in order to start the operation, your workers should have some say in the business, some (I'd honestly say ""ultimate"") say in where the profits go, and some investment into it."

This mix creates an economy that is entirely government controlled and the oligarchy/monopoly of businesses are bound to the government. Capitalism ≠ Corporatism.

It has its devils, the capitalists, always thwarting mans good works. Its followers faithfully bury themselves inside long discarded works and fight with each other over esoteric doctrines. It has its mystical utopian promised land that nobody seems to be able to articulate the steps to get to, but everyone is sure that some day, if only they believe strong enough, will just appear when everyone becomes enlightened.   And it has it's illogical beliefs you must believe to be  true follower. Like Christians must believe the Trinity (three gods is really one god), Communism would have you believe that one class is constantly conspiring to exploit another class, but at the same time you must accept that the ideology is NOT conspiratorial."
the_calibre_cat,2020-01-14 13:35:13,fede1j7,t3_envey3,t1_fedbbj8,"&gt; But then what do we do about the problems that exist in this system too  I don't think that there are problems with this system, tbh. Maybe you're referring to externalities, in which case I am for some limited government intervention, i.e. in cases like for environmental protection, etc. I don't think the Earth should be one huge city, in fact ideally, the less urbanization and the less industrialization, the better - but until we learn how to farm and manufacture in space, we don't have a choice and yes, government regulations can and do add massive costs to commercial operations.  Otherwise, it seems like the identified ""problems"" of this system are that a.) things cost money and b.) people without money don't get things and I fundamentally reject the notion that these are problems of this system, and that they are instead problems inherent to nature. We live in a universe where matter and energy have costs (i.e. there is no free lunch at the level of physical reality - first law of thermodynamics, the source of economic scarcity) and where everything is decaying (second law of thermodynamics, the enforcer of economic scarcity) - the idea that men and women are obligated to labor for others just because it's not a just idea, in my opinion. I accept that we may have to labor for you if you are in some way disabled, but the notion that one should get a free house and 80 years of free food and healthcare despite being able-bodied but not working? No.   The workers get their PS4s and vacations before they're obligated to provide free houses for people - and not only because it is just to allow people to enjoy their lives - but because if you're taking 80% of the working man's paycheck to provide a full house, water, heat, electricity, healthcare, shelter, food, internet and education... why the hell would he remain ""the working man?"" After all, he can stop working and get... free water, heat, electricity, healthcare, shelter, food, internet and education. He wouldn't. And then your production collapses. And then despite the promises you've written on official legislative stationary promising all free water, heat, electricity, healthcare, shelter, food, internet and education - you don't have the production to actually do it, because you've chosen to pretend economic incentives don't real.  This is the consequence that the overwhelming majority of socialists either deny or disregard. Either position is an incorrect one. People respond to incentives, whether we particularly like that facet of our nature or not.  &gt;What is the best system in your opinion so far?  Probably the welfare capitalisms out there like Europe and the United States, certainly in terms of HDI for their citizens. That said, I strongly question the sustainability of such systems, and the lack of sustainability is largely driven by public social investment. Not that I don't think it should be done at all, but if it is to be done, I think we could probably get way better value for our money than we are...  ...but then we veer into what system I think would be an improvement on today's society, and I think that improvement would be market-first socialism. Keep the market, but legally empower workers to have more autonomy in their places of work, and more of a split in the spoils. About the only ""free"" thing that I could be convinced to support is probably healthcare, although even there I think market healthcare would work just fine if not for massive government intrusions (Medicaid, Medicare, EMTALA, ACA, HIPAA, HITECH, etc - all of this shit had costs that my friends to the left regularly downplay or straight up ignore)."

We could look at counterrevolutions (e.g. Sukarno and Suharto, or the fascist takeover of Germany following the collapse of the German left) and conclude that capitalist counterrevolutionaries are just as repressive. The argument then would be that neither system is inherently violent, but changing a system requires violence.  In which case you're arguing for the moral superiority of capitalism because it already exists, not because it's actually any more implicitly peaceful. And, of course, many communist thinkers have argued that the history of European countries (e.g. colonialism, imperialism, and slavery) allowed them to establish the material conditions in their country that bred capitalism, implying that its rise to power was no less violent, but that this violence was done overseas and longer ago.  I'd be interested in hearing why you think your last paragraph here is correct- why do you think peaceful, stateless communism is impossible if the problem is the instability of transitions between systems? Even communist leaders like Lenin never described themselves as actually reaching the point you're quoting Engels on- Lenin famously described the organization of the USSR as ""state-capitalist"" for this reason."

I don't trust any biblical scholar who argues for the historicity of Jesus because I don't believe there's anyone who truly can't make the semantic distinction between the existence of the myth and the man.  That aside, I think that the evidences for historical Jesus is actually pretty thin, despite what the scholars say. And I do pay attention to what Biblical scholars say, because a lot of it undermines the Biblical account, and I know that they know this.

I feel like you're assuming that an employer should never have the right not to hire someone if he doesn't want to, which I find a bit disrespectful really. It's his company, not yours.  Also, keep in mind that whenever a company fires someone, they'll have to hire someone else, possibly at a higher price. It's not in a companies interest to fire their employees, so it only happens when someone does a lot of damage to a company. If your entire company goes on a strike and you respond with firing all of them, you might as well just file for bankruptcy straight away. No one is going to do that.   Blacklisting works the same, the only way to get blacklisted is by creating a reputation where no one even wants to give you a chance anymore, you'd have to do something incredibly stupid for that to happen.  So no, I'd rather protect freedom of association and keep hiring consensual on both sides, rather than letting a government decide if a company can fire on of its employees."

The latter was not a literal authoritarian figure, just like the former was not supposed to be.  Most attempts at socialism in the 20th century mimicked the USSR, sometimes with that nation's aid and guidance. It is easy to conclude from this that communism was meant to be something like that, that this is what Marx intended. As you have learned over the course of a few comments, Marx was vague and he changed his mind about how to achieve socialism. Given the nature of his writings, it is unlikely he would have supported the socialist experiments of the 20th century, and if it was indeed what he envisioned, he was certainly capable of making that clear from the very beginning."

guitar0622,2020-01-14 15:06:33,fedldl8,t3_eoay3n,t1_febez6b,"&gt;  From what we can see in primitive tribal societies there are extremely rigid classes.  Thos are tribal societies that exist today that have been corrupted by 10,000 years of class society around them. They dont exist in a vacuum, you cant have communism is people around you will pillage and loot you. These tribes have adapted to the unfortunate circumstances, which makes them extremely barbaric and nothing like the old tribes were.  &gt; Women cook or collect stuff and bear children and get raped, men of type 1 are eunuchs, men of type 2 hunt, men of type 3 make war and serve the supreme leader, and so forth.  It says thay Eunuchs exist only for 2000-3000 years:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eunuch  I am talking about 10,000 BCE before written history.  &gt; No surplus is needed to enslave others.   It looks pretty much like a tribal business to me, these new tribes. So they have specialized to hunt and to collect resources but for what? I bet so that they can trade with other tribes, that already is not self-sufficiency and there is already a class division here between the chieftain and his cronies and the rest of the tribe. The communist tribes had no chieftain, it was a council they ran everything democratically.  &gt;  Because it's all that's ever been observed, to wildly varying degrees of course.  There are still tribes in africa that are communist , although a minority but still, it at least proves that private property is not necessary.  &gt;  So in your view the 20th century was just the first of many attempts to establish communism?  No, there were many attempts way before it. In fact human history is filled with failed attempts to bring back communism but inside that specific era. For example many ancient slave revolts wanted to establish a more egalitarian society (Spartacus), then the middle age peasant revolts wanted a feudal village based communes to interact with eachother, then 17-18th century communists had utopian ideas about industrial based one. Neither of them worked or were crushed before they had a chance, but this doesnt mean that communism will not be achieved, however it will be only achieved when the time is ready for it, it can't be sped up , it will come when the environment is ready for it.  &gt;  Or will it for some reason gradually move towards communism without a revolution? I'm no expert but I don't think that's orthodox.  I dont know whether there will be a revolution or not. Certainly there has been a revolutionary fetish since the 19th century, but I am not sure if it's necessary. Of course Marx said that class struggle is essential, but struggle doesnt have to mean violent revolts.   Of course he based his theory on how past systems were overthrown by revolutions, but this is historical revisionism, I mean all revolts have failed so it was certainly not the past revolutions that moved society. The French and American and Bolshevik revolutions are very fringe examples inside an ocean of failed ones. I mean in the middle ages there was a peasant revolt every year, sometimes 2-3 / year and they have all failed. Well it didnt end feudalism that way.  Furthermore the French revolution is an exception rather than the rule, in most countries feudalism ended peacefully or with some struggle but not massive bloodshed. So of course the Bolsheviks based their strategy on the French revolution, which is why it was so authoritarian.  However it's quite possible that it can be a peaceful transition, in fact if it's stretched out over time it would happen gradually and people wouldnt even notice it, they would just get slowly accustomed to it. After all it will rise out of Capitalism, so people wont be driven into completely unknown territory it will be quite familiar."

However the agreements are likely to be vastly in favor for the employer because a right wing libertarian system is designed to maximize the bargaining power of capital and minimize the amount of bargaining power of labor.   Contracts would be strictly enforced, but in practice, from my experience talking to lawyers in the past, even the most detailed contracts tend to have grey areas that were not previously anticipated...    Any arbitration would be decided against the employee most of tbe time.    Property rights too would be sacrosanct. Those who have property would be completely dominant over those without."

As i said before he was vague about how communism would look in the future, instead describing it as the movement to abolish the present state of the things. HOwever he did give his clearest answers in the CM. And the experiments of the CM mostly line up with the USSR's attempt, minus all the anti democratic bullshit the bolsheviks did (though most marxists would just say democracy as it stands is mostly a bourgeoise convention). IF you were to say that there is not much in marx about the vanguard party a la lenin, i would be inclined to agree. however, i definitely do see the seeds of authoritarianism in marx, esp in the plans laid out in the CM, his MOST WIDELY INFLUENTIAL WORK. and here i agree with Leszek Kołakowski's thesis.  I dont think marx was an ancom. but hey, i'm not a marxist, i'm not an expert on marxism. if you want to be an ancom who says marx would have hated the bolsheviks that's fine by me. but the fact is that every state run by communists implemented the ten planks for the most part. IF you know of exceptions, I would be interested to know for the sake of argument. I would guess catalonia might have not implemented all ten planks but hey they werent run by marxists, for the most part, right?  the DOTP is a dictatorship, which is necessarily authoritarian . I get that it is intended to exist just to destroy the DOTB and stamp out the vestiges of that regime but that would take at least 100 years or something (depending how brutal you get). and once you have afew decades of an authoritarians regime, my guess is that it does not easily dismantle itself."

Are they happy with where they work? Or have they begun looking for job alternatives?

To say that if there are no bourgeoise, there'll be no work, is to say there'll be no work *in the present definition of work, i.e. the inherent to capitalism wage labour.* 3. Making a ""business from scratch"" is something that people - the petty-bourgeois - do *for themselves,* not for others. The telos of the ""private business"" is private interest, not human welfare.  And yes, I agree with you that we have to make up our minds about the bourgeois condition, which is dually overwhelmed. On the one side, by the proletarian themselves, jogging the state, unionizing, following their own track in the class struggle. On the other, it's overwhelmed by the market, by the ways in which it functions and the promise it makes, mostly to the petty-bourgeois: ""*I'll crush you as harder I can, the moment I can*"". The struggle not to be crushed by the market is bourgeois' job. That's what they (and you, obviously) call ""hard work"".

There is not much reason for thinking so. Take one simple test — the ability to withstand nationalism. It is often loosely said that ‘Science is international’, but in practice the scientific workers of all countries line up behind their own governments with fewer scruples than are felt by the writers and the artists. The German scientific community, as a whole, made no resistance to Hitler. Hitler may have ruined the long-term prospects of German science, but there were still plenty of gifted men to do the necessary research on such things as synthetic oil, jet planes, rocket projectiles and the atomic bomb. Without them the German war machine could never have been built up.*   &gt;   &gt;[George Orwell, 'What is Science](https://orwell.ru/library/articles/science/english/e_scien)'  The basic premise of this marvellous essay by Orwell is that we can't expect *the scientists* (in the well-accepted narrow definition of *natural scientists*) to be good at politics, social relations and so on."

Ultraliberals are always so close to authoritatianism because of this bullshit. Authoritarian private enterprises are just as bad as authoritarian governments.

You can choose not to be a part of it, and then you enter the realm of coercion and violence. Hence, revolutions. So chose: want to leave free and in peace? Be a part of your community. Doesn't want that? Than do something about it, but by doing it you are outside politics, and thus in the realm of coersion. Do not expect to be able to go against everyone else. And by the way, are you under the illusion that you are born an adult in a vat? You are born from humans, you are made into a person by interacting with your community. You are part of a whole that made you yourself. There is no escaping that. You are born tied to a million cultural norms you are not even aware of most of the time, and as you nature they only tighten up. You didn't come up with your ideas alone, you didn't become who you are independent of your society, with its political norms and economic systems, it's culture and geography. You may rebel, but you do so in a way you would. You are, my fellow human, already participating, since before your birth, and you will keep doing so after you die."

There are flawed and outdated works among this catalogue, and they sold be critiqued, but what you offer is a completely unsubstantiated ego driven rejection, not a critique.

For a good outline of Marx, check out Ernest Mandel’s “Introduction to Marxist Economics” or Engels’ “Socialism: Utopian and Scientific”.

I object to this notion where workers are apparently supposed to give up every cent of their wealth beyond their subsistence costs because the world is not yet perfect and other people need their money more than they do. Seems like we'd be trading one form of slavery (wage slavery) with another form of slavery (social slavery), with no net gain in individual autonomy.  &gt;Which would be fine, but we currently live in liberal-democratic nation-states and people need to be medically treated and housed and fed *now*.  Yes, as it turns out, we live in a universe where economic scarcity is a thing. I'm not opposed to some anti-poverty efforts, but I'm also not opposed to putting some of the onus on the individual experiencing it to help solve it. If you taxed everyone at 100% *right now*, you wouldn't solve homelessness. You'd make it worse - this suggests that people's paychecks are not your playthings with which to realize your social wet dreams, but are, in fact, numerical representations of both their efforts to society, and society's valuation of them, and violently-empowered bureaucrats don't really ethically have any claim to them.  Acknowledging that the bourgeoisie should not have claim to the surplus of workers' labor does not require support of policies that guarantee anyone and everyone unlimited claim to endless amounts of free shit."

Not OP, but I presume there's a difference between what they characterize as ""revolution via cultural bullshit"" (i.e. this idea some conservatives have that secret communists in the media/businesses/academia/everywhere are pushing cultural movements like gay rights with the goal of subverting/destabilizing western culture), versus the relatively common-sense notion that 21st century communists, to be remotely successful, need to know how to interface with technology, the media, and finance to build support, rather than expecting disillusioned military defects to lead a violent revolution, or farmers to wage protracted people's war, or whatnot.  That is, some schools of thought float the idea that tackling cultural hegemony will be crucial in establishing ""class consciousness"", but none say that ""capitalism"" or ""the west"" ought to be destroyed (or even can be destroyed) by promoting cultural movements which are tangential at best, such as gay rights."

What about what you posted demonstrates that Offspring isn't a fake anti-corporate band signed by Columbia to bilk money from suckers who buy their supposed anti-corporate status?    Wait I thought that they ever signed with Columbia at all was a lie I was telling and actually Offspring was legitimately an anti-corporatist band instead of a ploy by the record labels to trick people like you into giving them money?    Did Offspring sign with Columbia, or didn't they?    They did. Columbia. Evidence has been presented, why ignore it?    Or pop trash like ""Pretty Fly for a White Guy"", right?    So wikipedia is wrong that they were signed to Columbia, one of the world's biggest multimedia corporations?

If you’re about facts and logic why employ the ridiculous strawman?  Yeah, right, ""nobody"" believes in it, they just consistently advocate for higher and higher taxes on ""the rich"" to fund more and more social programs every single election cycle. And yet, not one election cycle have I heard, ""Nah, I think taxes are high enough, that money belongs to the people who earned it.""  Actions speak louder than words, and the actions indicate that as long as any social ill exists, socialists by and large will never *not* attempt to bill everyone else to resolve it.  &gt;Again, Finland has been doing fairly well  Finland has a homeless-to-total-population ratio of 0.13%. The United States has a homeless-to-total-population ratio of 0.17%. France, Germany, Sweden? 0.21%, 0.37%, and 0.36%, according to available data. The United States isn't the best - but neither are we the worst, and if we listened to the rhetoric bandied about by current presidential candidates and left-wing periodicals, you'd think the only people with houses are billionaires.  &gt;Yeah it takes tax money, but no sane person wants to tax anyone to the point they can only afford to survive, that’s completely asinine. Who are you arguing against?  Again, those who - by their actions of the past - will never not stump for a tax increase and a social program at every chance they get. Give me a hard number, a ""We won't tax you beyond this percentage *total*"" and that would mean a lot.  But that'll never fucking happen, and I have a sneaking suspicion that it's in part because generally speaking, leftists object not just to ""private property"", but the concept of property more generally. I'm not opposed to some sharing, but you're damn right I'm pretty opposed to the government stomping in and forcing me to not only associate, but *subsidize* groups of people with whom I have no affiliation beyond that we live somewhat near one another?  &gt;You don’t sound like a socialist at all, you sound like a neolib.  I've never claimed to be a hard socialist, I *do* think there are limited circumstances in which private property isn't an unethical construct. But by and large, absent these circumstances (personal risk), I think workers should be enfranchised with ownership of the means of production, autonomy over their lines as well as a say in the company's direction as a whole.  Note that this is very specifically limited to *those* workers in *that* organization - I think this fully counts as socialist, but I am still generally disdainful of public organizations beyond the military, utilities excluding internet, *maaaaaybe* healthcare, and environmental protection (which in my view would include, like, parks - both urban and national). Otherwise I'm strongly opposed to the drive to put everything in the hands of the public sector and paid for by tax money."

crankyfrankyreddit,2020-01-15 00:31:48,fef4zjx,t3_eoay3n,t1_fef06e3,"&gt;It's wrong because labor is simply not the only determinant of value. Value is determined by demand, which is determined by price.  Demand is determined by price, which is determined by what? Prices are not arbitrary, they are a function of the cost of production. If a product costs more money than the wage I get in the time required for me to produce it on my own, then the rational decision is to not purchase it.  The underlying factor that determines one's subjective evaluation of a product is still roughly, essentially, the socially necessary labour time, whether that labour is directly producing the good or if it is being traded for equivalent products. The determinate factor of value still appears to be quantity of labour.   &gt;Wine gains value with age.  And to age wine requires some oversight and equipment, whose cost is ultimately measurable in the form of a quantity of labour.  &gt;Gold has value with no labor.  The gold in the earth does not have value until human labour is applied to it, to mine and refine it.  &gt;Ideas have value with no labor.  Ideas are literally the direct product of intellectual labour, and to record, share, and make use of ideas also requires labour. Without some form of labour, there is no use-value, so there can be no price, no value.  &gt;Sure, labor correlates with value, but it is clearly not the determinant of value.  This is not clear from what you say at all.  &gt; The main problem with his paper is that he does not account for the fact that larger earning firms employ more people, and lesser earning ones employ less people.  This is not a problem for the LTV; We would exactly expect that the greater the labour input, given some nonzero rate of exploitation, the higher the profit will be.  That thread is interesting, for sure, but by no means does anything said in it invalidate the LTV, it at best asks interesting and difficult questions that are as yet unaccounted for in any theory of price or value."

It's not really a straw man when our current system is based upon libertarians failed system. Thus we get the welfare-state of the 20th century.  \&gt;Right libertarians want private individuals to freely decide for themselves how their business should be run which includes co-ops. Left libertarians want to abolish other forms of running a business in favour of co-ops. They want to impose the co-op system on others which is why voluntaryism is incompatible with the left.  co-ops are extremely rare in a right-libertarian economy, which is why Robert Owen is often used as an example. Since he was one of few philanthropists of his time that helped the UK.   I'm not a left-libertarian, but both ideologies are forcing other to do as they please.

You should help people *if* they require help for an acceptable standard of living.  &gt; Become a landlord  This is not a trivial task or even necessarily possible to accomplish.  &gt; So the fuck what? Work hard and earn it.   This may not be possible. If people build a breakaway economy that works fully on automation, you're not necessary there.   &gt;There are no guarantees in life.   This is a descriptive statement, not a prescriptive one. There *should* be guarantees in life. We can't make a 100% foolproof system, but we *should* try.   &gt;Socialism can't change that.   I'm not necessarily even advocating for socialism, consider a nordic model solution.  &gt; No, I am not responsible for other people.    This is where you make the mistake. You **are** responsible for other people. You do not exist in a vacuum. If you shoot someone, you're responsible for their death because you made an unacceptable choice in that circumstance. If you're not responsible for other people, you're free to shoot them. If you are responsible for other people (which you are), you're going to have to help them. If you still insist, then why the fuck should I not kill you as soon as I see you in a society like the one you're describing?  The method in which you kill a person, action *or* inaction, is **completely irrelevant**. All that matters is the possible outcomes and the outcome (out of that range) that you chose.   Why do you want anarcho-capitalism? I assume because of freedom, ostensibly. The problem is that you *can't be free if you have no security.* What difference does it make if you're being oppressed by a state (we may have differing definitions for that, but still) or by nature? If your answer is that the former is avoidable, so is the latter. A system with optimal freedom would take into account that you do not have freedom without security. In order to build a system like this, responsibility must exist for everyone to help everyone else.

Analogously, if you make some claim about the Frankfurt school, and some user says that you’re factually wrong without providing evidence, it does not entitle you to maintain that your claim is correct. The onus is on you to provide evidence (e.g. direct quotes from Adorno or other writers associated with the organization) supporting your claim.

But that obsession with peer review is the weirdest thing, the term ""chair"" hasn't been subjected to peer reviewing, do you deny it's a useful term ? Words are not objective things, there's no academic research of the One True Word to define a given concept.

I don't know what your deal is, what makes you think I'm a radical social constructionist ?  I am indeed a social constructionist when talking about society, because society is BY DEFINITION socially constructed, a lot of things you take for objective and true are social constructions to a certain extent, money, borders, laws, even morals even if a case can be made that some of them take root in biology, and then again so does social behavior, which constructs the things we talked about, so saying something is biological in origin doesn't mean it's also not socially constructed.  So to drive the point home, politics are the manner in which public life is organized, it is a fundamentally social endeavor, by which society structures itself. Politics are a social construction.  &gt;So you quit being a radical religious zealot and then I don't have to be, okay?  Lol what ? I'm not trying to convert you or anything, I'm trying to walk you through how the term actually makes sense even if it's contradictory, it's not an attack on capitalism, it's an internal critique of socialism. So you can rest now, nobody wants to take away your favorite word."

How’s *that* for revisionism?   &gt;The Soviet controlled German Communist Party and their paramilitary wing Antifaschistische Aktion were key players in the rise of Nazism.  The German KPD was indeed Stalinist at the time and in the early 1930s would sometimes ally with the Nazi party against the Social Democrats, which had not yet been purged of its quasi-leftist elements. No one denies that these elements were there back then. (And just to be clear, a nationalist leftism is not something I want any part of. Fuck Strasserists too). You even had the Communists calling the Social Democratic Party fascists, which is obviously absurd.   But even in mid-1932 there was violence between the KPD and the NSDAP surrounding the election. Not something allies do. The KPD considered the Nazis enemies too, just less so than the SPD. Which proved to be a grave miscalculation.   The specific original Antifaschistische Aktion group led by Ernst Thälmann was indeed Stalinist (which was part of the very stupid reason they regarded the SPD as fascist) and only existed until 1933, the same year the Nazis formed government. From then on, the Communists were some of the first targets of the Nazis, and the German antifascist movement from then on was completely splintered, unable to form a unified movement for obvious reasons.   So to imply that the antifa movement as a whole was/is pro-Nazi, especially after 1933, is completely disingenuous. I happen to know that pointing out KPD-Nazi connections, and equating socialists and Nazis more generally, is a common fascist debate tactic designed to muddy the waters and confuse less knowledgeable people. I’m not fooled.   Politics be complicated, especially in the late Weimar Republic.   &gt;No it fucking didn't. Just like the Holocaust doesn't refer to the Shoah (first used in 1939) and Generalplan Ost but to the GENOCIDE of Armenians, Assyrian and Greeks about 50 years before WW2. The term was later popularized in the United States by the NBC mini-series Holocaust (1978)  From Wikipedia:  * *In 1944, Raphael Lemkin created the term genocide in his book **Axis Rule** in Occupied Europe. The book describes the implementation of **Nazi policies** in occupied Europe, and cites earlier mass killings.[13](http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007050)* * The source mentions his thinking was influenced by the Armenian Genocide, but writing about WWII and the Holocaust (or Shoah, if you prefer) is what actually prompted him to invent a word for that kind of crime. Obviously, the word genocide can refer to things that happened before the Holocaust.   &gt;Of course dumbass, do you think I'm just gonna accept my genocide or what?  Certainly not. But the *Dutch* aren’t under threat of genocide and even if they were fascism wouldn’t be the appropriate response. You’re more full of it than a Kinder egg."

Manzikirt,2020-01-15 06:58:06,feg0a64,t3_em1y3v,t1_fect1s5,"&gt;Here's a reason .  First, this article doesn't compare the value of government funding versus private funding, just the number of donors. Second, even if donors did compensate for the loss this does nothing to establish trends over the long or even medium term. This is one cherry picked example that doesn't even truly support the conclusion you draw.  &gt;I would imagine this website is funded by the profits from going after people who cause food poisoning  Again, a single example is not enough to base a society on.  &gt;The government does have a certain ""crowding out"" effect that can't be denied.  Sure, when the government solves a problem we don't have to hope the market will. The question I asked is why we should expect the market to solve the problem when it historically failed to do so before the government got involved.  &gt;Historically, when the government wasn't involved, the country was much poorer - comparable to third world countries today.  What does the history before the government's involvement matter other than to show that in the absence of government involvement the market  failed to address the issue?   The progression seems simple. Society was too poor to afford food safety, then they could afford government solutions but not market ones. As far as I'm concerned this proves that the government solution is cheaper than the market solution (else the market would have solved the issue before the government stepped in).  So why did the market fail to address the issue before the government got involved? And Why has it failed to significantly compete with the government in this area to date despite doing so in other industries?"

At the time, the 'governments' of the day was the nobility. Although the nobility system was far more rigid than governments today, the royal class essentially served the role of a government: receiving tax, providing protection and enforcing laws etc.   The bougeois toppled this system in favour for a laissez-fair economy where people could trade freely.   If you have to make any comparison between the old nobility class, the best comparison today is by far modern day governments, not companies, for governments share similarities of purpose, structure, revenue and principles."

But I thought we were discussing if a libertarian government interferes with the free market? Did you forget that?   &gt;If your rights are insufficiently funded then your rights become in danger.  I agree. We disagree that your funding mechanism is sufficient. I do not dispute how it would work, I am simply saying it wouldn't work well enough to guarantee rights. You claim it is sufficient, I have provided an argument it is not, you have simply said I'm wrong with no argument. That is where we stand.   &gt;What you're implying is the society would be willing to give up their rights, correct?  ?  &gt;Yup. Through the free market.  There is no evidence the free market would do this. In fact, every advanced nation shows that private institutions and individuals generally discourage democracy in the workplace.  &gt;Forcing someone to provide something is a violation.  Disagree  &gt;We're talking about a Libertarian society and how government protected rights interfere with the free market.  It was an example. Take any top 1% you want, they can fund large armies. You're trying to bog me down in semantics rather than addressing your incompetent ideology. You're scared you're wrong and won't face it.   &gt;You just don't like the answers given.

My opinion My opinion.  Again, a strawman. And not even a good one. You flipped your script here. You don't even have your own talking points straight.   The only system that leaves the market free from outside influence is anarchy. But you support a libertarian government so you support some restriction on the market.  &gt;socialism doesn't work because the entire economy relies on its citizens working for free.   Socialism is when workers own the means of production, at its simplest definition. Notice how it doesn't say ""eVeRyOnE WoRkS fOr FrEe""  &gt;Not to mention socialism is against human rights  Socialism is the only path to sufficiently protect human rights. This is why I'm a socialist.   &gt; individuals have an incentive to protect their property through donations &amp; volunteering to their government for protection.  The rich have greater incentive to use their enormous, unchecked power to dominate society. Socialism provides a realistic check on this. Libertarians plug their ears."

Here is what Rothbard thinks about trademark  &gt; ...Many writers have objected that brand names and trade-marks, generally considered as part of the free market, really constitute grants of special privilege by the State. No other firm can “compete” with Hershey chocolates by producing its own product and calling it Hershey chocolates.34 Is this not a State-imposed restriction on freedom of entry? And how can there be “real” freedom of entry under such conditions?  &gt; This argument, however, completely misconceives the nature of liberty and of property. Every individual in the free society has a right to ownership of his own self and to the exclusive use of his own property. Included in his property is his name, the linguistic label which is uniquely his and is identified with him. A name is an essential part of a man’s identity and therefore of his property. To say that he is a “monopolist” over his name is saying no more than that he is a “monopolist” over his own will or property, and such an extension of the word “monopolist” to every individual in the world would be an absurd usage of the term. The “governmental” function of defense of person and property, vital to the existence of a free society so long as any people are disposed to invade them, involves the defense of each person’s particular name or trademark against the fraud of forgery or imposture. It means the outlawing of John Smith’s pretending to be Joseph Williams, a prominent lawyer, and selling his own legal advice after stating to clients that he is selling that of Williams. This fraud is not only implicit theft of the consumer, but it is also abusing the property right of Joseph Williams to his unique name and individuality. And the use by some other chocolate firm of the Hershey label would be an equivalent perpetration of an invasive act of fraud and forgery.  &gt; Footnote: It might be objected that these concepts are vague and give rise to problems. Problems do arise, but they are not insuperable. Thus, if one man is named Joseph Williams, does this preclude anyone else from having the same name, and is any future Joseph Williams to be considered a criminal? The answer is clearly: No, so long as there is no attempt by one to impersonate the other. In short, it is not so much the name per se which an individual owns, but the name as an affiliate of his person.  This is what Rothbard think about copyright and patents:  http://cdn.whipups.net/uploads/236/7patents_copyrights.pdf  &gt;...  The copyright is therefore a logical device of property right on the free market."

You didn't tell me how you enforce your own price-fixing system (and still didn't tell me what system it was. You mocked me for my narrow mind but you still didn't tell me what solution did your bright mind envision).   It is not a ""mechanism to increase profit"", it is a natural law of any system where there is competition between suppliers ( and competition between demanders, although theoretically this one isn't as important).   In order to get rid of this natural law, you must change the system, and therefore get rid of competition.   How do you achieve that ? How do you make sure that the companies that your State acknowledges are the only companies effectively producing goods and services ? How do you make sure there is no black market ?     &gt;Because any type of socialism was *imposed* on them. There was no solidarity. There was a hierarchy(the vanguard).   That's unnecessary in this day and age. Workers read and write these days. Workers have access to a communication system, the internet.   So you do believe that human nature changed that much between then and now.   You have to admit that all your rationale is based on a belief; and that you basically have nothing to back it up.  That doesn't mean you're wrong, but I think that should at least make you humble and cautious when you present your theories. And you're not.     P.S. : You really are disrespectful. I hope you acknowledge it and change your attitude. Thank you.

In fact, a big part of the Frankfurt school's critique is that ""mass culture"" is sort of antithetical to traditional western cultures, and results in them being uprooted and replaced with homogeneous consumerist norms (e.g. restaurants serving some local cuisine being replaced by chain franchises, etc.)  The critiques of modernity made by the Frankfurt school are really fairly similar to the ones currently being made by the traditionalist right (some right-wing movements, such as NRx, transparently borrow from the Frankfurt school quite a bit)."

In India, children living at $1.90 still have a 60% chance of being malnourished. In Niger, infants living at $1.90 have a mortality rate three times higher the global average. The same story can be told of many other countries. If $1.90 is too low to achieve basic nutrition, or to secure a fair chance of surviving the first year of life, why are we using it?”  “If we want to stick with a single international line, we might use the “ethical poverty line” devised by Peter Edward of Newcastle University. He calculates that in order to achieve normal human life expectancy of just over 70 years, people need roughly 2.7 to 3.9 times the existing poverty line. In the past, that was $5 a day.

Donations and volunteers don't interfere with the market.. literally how times do i have to say it??  &gt;Socialism is when workers own the means of production.

Nope. 1) becoming a billionaire in a Libertarian society would be almost impossible. 2) the free market gives the citizens control over authoritarian businesses, if a business beings to take on authoritarian ideas then the citizens would boycott said business.

Nonetheless, I find that it is a systematic emerging law that, where there is 2 competing producers, the price will be set by the meeting of the supply and of the demand.     A society that doesn't use money still uses currency of all sorts. Everything can be a currency. We use money as currency because it is simply the best, or it usually is. Some have a preference for gold or dollar (I mean from a non-American perspective) ! There can be inconsistencies in the price based on whether you trade goods that might go out-of-date, lack of liquidity, and lack of information. It's still a meeting of the supply and of the demand, just under more constraints.  Only if you make people something ELSE than producers can you change the paradigm.   So the other guy wasn't wrong to talk about cooperation.  I just questioned whether his system could rely entirely on cooperation, whether everyone would go along.   Capitalism works just fine even when people within it cooperate. I'd even say it works better. You invite your family for a dinner, you don't ask them to pay for it. It's ok.   Just when you publicly take some action, you're subject to state intervention like taxation or regulation. So it is pretty easy to enforce the system to a sufficient extent. You can't cheat at an impactful level (unless you **already** have some power at an impactful level).  Central planning socialism doesn't do very well with liberal inputs. If it fails to enforce the state market, it is deeply corrupted and inefficient. People will resort to market based on the meeting of supply and demand. It just an empirical rule. If it succeeds to enforce it, it deprives people of their liberty so much that the society crumbles. It's all I'm saying."

What if there aren't any jobs available for that person and they can't afford to be retrained? Automation is sweeping people's jobs away at breakneck speeds and people can't convert their effort into money no matter how hard they work when they can't get a job. What if they begin from conditions that aren't their own fault?  &gt;You are just lazy.  \[...\] you sit there and don't help *anyone* yourself. When the fuck are *you* going to pick up the slack and help the needy?   I don't usually respond to direct ad hominems, but I feel it's relevant here. I've done this my entire life to the best of my abilities without exception. You have no idea who I am. If you knew me in real life, you'd understand just how laughably incorrect this statement is. I've done nothing but work and study my entire life to become a productive citizen who pays his taxes, helps everyone around him, will one day have a family and be a pillar of his community. I will consider myself a failure of a human being if I don't do everything in my ability to live a life that allows me to build myself up to help others.  **This is the biggest mistake you make here.** You're assuming that the only reason people fail is that they're lazy. You assume that hardworking people can't be fucked over by society.   &gt;No, I am not. I am responsible for *me.* You don't get to shove others onto me.    By any reasonable moral system you're wrong. I'm not asking you to donate everything you have to a charity in Africa where it won't make a difference in the long run. I'm asking you to take part in building a better system that ensures that *everyone* has the opportunity to achieve an acceptable standard of living. This would be done by reasonable increases in taxes that would also get something for you. Hell, because the taxes are a stable bulk order purchase, they'll probably cost less for you and be net plus (e.g. healthcare).  &gt;Go ahead and try. You'll be the one that won't survive a week with this attitude.   I see. So you're not even responsible for killing someone in this society? Do you want to know what that looks like? Somalia. That's Somalia you're describing. Are you going to buy a bulletproof house? Are you going to stop sleeping to guard it? How will you go to the corner store when you're getting shot at and the store has been robbed? That's at best Cyberpunk you're describing. Do you understand how fucked you would be as soon as the power vacuum kicks in? Imagine when the corporations decide to become nation states, *except this time you don't get to vote*. **What difference is there between a state and a corporation at that point?** I mean, can't you just pretend that a state is just a corporation that happens to own all the land, technically speaking?  &gt; Grow the fuck up. That's not how life works, or will ever work.   I live in one of the most prosperous countries on the planet with some of the happiest people, we're near the top in PISA education tests consistently and our healthcare system is so good that David Beckham came here to get his leg fixed, and we're also up there in rankings of highest quality of life. In virtually every way imaginable the country is better for the average person than countries with more deregulated markets.  And it's Finland. It's pretty close to having guarantees in life. This isn't even socialism. This is Nordic Model capitalism. That's all I'm advocating for. It's well within our reach considering **it already exists**, and it's the best solution for everyone.   And, after all, I'm not responsible for anyone, so I don't really have to worry if you're going to live in the hell and horror of... living in a state. You won't survive with that attitude, at least not while having a life worth living."

Jasko1111,2020-01-15 23:33:15,fei68kp,t3_ep3ek8,t3_ep3ek8,"Political philosophy is about determining what is legitimate force and what is not.  &gt; The men who are to protect the community against violent aggression easily turn into the most dangerous aggressors. They transgress their mandate. They misuse their power for the oppression of those whom they were expected to defend against oppression. The main political problem is how to prevent the police power from becoming tyrannical. This is the meaning of all the struggles for liberty.   - Mises  &gt; For we are not, in constructing a theory of liberty and property, i.e., a ""political"" ethic, concerned with all *personal* moral principles. We are not herewith concerned whether it is moral or immoral for someone to lie, to be a good person, to develop his faculties, or be kind or mean to his neighbors. We are concerned, in this sort of discussion, solely with such ""political ethical"" questions as the proper role of violence, the sphere of rights, or the definitions of criminality and aggression.   - Rothbard   Anarcho capitalists dont just say your use of force is illegitimate, they also explain why it is illegitimate.  There are utilitarian and  natural law - natural rights explanations, there is also not well known argumentative ethics explanation developed by Hans-Hermann Hoppe:  First, it must be noted that the question of what is just or unjust— or for that matter the even more general question of what is a valid proposition and what is not—only arises insofar as I am, and others are, capable of propositional exchanges, i.e., of argumentation. The question does not arise vis-à-vis a stone or fish because they are incapable of engaging in such exchanges and of producing validity claiming propositions. Yet if this is so—and one cannot deny that it is without contradicting oneself, as one cannot argue the case that one cannot argue—then any ethical proposal as well as any other proposition must be assumed to claim that it is capable of being validated by propositional or argumentative means.  It is self-contradictory and therefore self-refuting for anyone to deny the Misesian action axiom (that everyone acts), since the very attempt to deny it is itself an action.  Someone arguing that self ownership does not exist is self-contradiction. For anyone who tried to justify any norm whatsoever would already have to presuppose the exclusive right of control over his body as a valid norm simply in order to say, “I propose such and such.” Anyone disputing such a right would become caught up in a practical contradiction since arguing so would already imply acceptance of the very norm which he was disputing.   Furthermore, it would be equally impossible to sustain argumentation for any length of time and rely on the propositional force of one’s arguments if one were not allowed to appropriate in addition to one’s body other scarce means through homesteading action (by putting them to use before somebody else does), and if such means and the rights of exclusive control regarding them were not defined in objective physical terms. For if no one had the right to control anything at all except his own body, then we would all cease to exist and the problem of justifying norms simply would not exist. Thus, by virtue of the fact of being alive, property rights to other things must be presupposed to be valid..."

noamwalker,2020-01-16 01:48:26,feiihs6,t3_ep64gy,t3_ep64gy,"Hear me. Ownership ought to be transferred at the point of compensation. One can reject compensation and retain ownership, but if they accept compensation they must transfer ownership. The only thing that would allow one to accept compensation and retain ownership is a coercive system of exploitation based on a dichotomy between property owners and non property owners.  If you sell the machine, it is for a lump sum, and you no longer own it. If you keep the machine, and you use it, it is yours and you can keep all the money you make. If you allow someone to use the machine, they are obliged to compensate you. This could be that they give you a bit of the money they make from the sale of the socks they made by using the machine (what’s left over is a wage). However, at the point that they’ve paid you a price equivalent to half the price you would have sold the machine for, they are now an equal owner of the machine. And any money they make by using it further is fully theirs. This is what ‘worker ownership of the means of production’ means.   The problem is if the system allows you to keep taking money from them even after the point of compensation. It would be like if you sold them the machine, and then still asked for money to rent it.   This is so absurd that it would never happen in a single situation unless the buyer is stupid. However, this is allowed to occur all the time in an unjust system. There is a difference between situations and systems.   Everyone should always be compensated where it is due. As long as this is true, people will always have an incentive to be productive."

To rent a thing, and thereby make more money than you could by selling it, without paying out an equal cost, is unjustified because it implies those renting it are not compensated.

What are your arguments in favour of less regulation and freer markets  What *exactly* do you mean by 'regulation'?  Because it often seems like people assume that 'more government' and 'less freedom' are synonymous, like society has a slider with 'government' on one end and 'freedom' on the other. And that's not the case. A lot of the time, government is important for *maintaining* freedom. This may sometimes be through measures you might call 'regulations', such as a tax on air pollution. I think it would be more accurate to say that I'm in favor of *the right* regulations, rather than none at all.  &gt;Wouldn’t that just make basic necessities (such as education or access to healthcare) only available to those who start with money  What does it mean to 'start with money'?  &gt;Finance, also, seems like a common sense thing to nationalize. It’s free government revenue basically, becasue everyone, rich and poor, uses banks to store what wealth they have, so any interest can form government revenue. Simple!  The idea of the bank is usually that the people storing their money there get to collect the interest (or at least a good portion of it). So a bank that doesn't do that would need to sell the idea that the government having that revenue is better than the bank's customers having that revenue.  With that being said, we definitely have a problem in the current system where banks are licensed by the government to lend out way more money than they actually have. Essentially, they're granted monopoly power over this form of lending, which allows them to collect unearned economic rent. We should definitely look into changing that, one way or another. Whether the solution boils down to private banks sans licensing, or government-run banks, or a combination of both, remains to be seen. But eliminating artificial monopolies is always a good first step, and things tend to look clearer afterwards.  &gt;What benefit would that have on the economy other than the dogmatic statement “private more efficient”  You're right that that's a stupid dogmatic statement.  A much more accurate statement would be: 'Competition is more efficient than monopolism.' This applies to both governments and private businesses. Where private businesses compete in free markets, they become extremely efficient and productive; where private businesses enjoy large, valuable monopolies, they become extremely inefficient and abusive. Similarly, where politicians actually compete for voters, they become relatively effective and reasonable; and where politicians enjoy immunity from public oversight, they become relatively oppressive and corrupt. I think if we could start seeing the world in terms of this freedom-vs-monopolism divide rather than the private-vs-government divide, things would make a lot more sense and improve more quickly."

To really dig deep and question your ideology, you have to ask yourself, what do you really want for humanity deep down? Do you want everyone’s basic needs to be met so that they may more easily achieve their higher purpose and be happy? Every single person? If so, you might not want to be loyal to an economic system that’s based around a relatively small group of people having control of most of the wealth.   Just as an example, homelessness is an issue I care a lot about. Why is it that we allow anyone to sleep out in the street, when we now that proper shelter is a basic human need? Because the *business* of housing under capitalism isn’t prepared to do that. For there to be a viable housing market, there always has to be someone to sell to. People move from time to time, sure, but a whole lot less transactions would happen if no one were at risk of being out in the cold. Making people fearful of losing something is good for business under capitalism, and I think that’s wrong.   But the economics of it weren’t why I became a socialist originally, it was the social beliefs espoused by the socialists and the anarchists. The Noam Chomskys, the Kurt Vonneguts, the Emma Goldmans, the Tommy Douglases, et cetera. These are my people. They’re on my wavelength. Ask yourself who your equivalents to those people are.   Personally I’m a fan generally of the Nordic economies but I view them as a stepping stone to *real* market socialism (we should restart the Meidner Plan).   Social democracy is a good idea in the short term and should be implemented, but with capitalism as the main mode of production still in place, *ultimately* capitalists will still hold sway and will be able to reverse victories achieved by socialists and social democrats. And with socdems always implicitly prepared to *appease* capitalists rather than *oppose* them, their strategy will be less bold and already compromised from the outset.

Well-known horrors of twentieth century communism: of Lenin, Stalin, Mao and Pol Pot, are the logical unfolding, the embodiment, of the nineteenth century vision of their master, Karl Marx.   Along with the transcendence and negation of private property will come the negation of virtually all aspects of modem civilization, which Marx also considered 'subsidiary modes of production' alienating man from his supposed true nature.   Marx writes:  &gt; Religion, the family, the state, law, morality, science, art, etc., are only particular modes of production, and fall under its general law. The positive transcendence of private property, as the appropriation of human living, is, therefore the positive transcendence of all alienation and thus the return of man from religion, the family, the state, etc., to his human, i.e. social existence.  But if all these cherished institutions are to be rudely stripped from man, what then remains to this poor, 'liberated' creature?   These post-Marxian creatures would be deprived of all human interrelations that make up a society. These 'complete' individuals would be deprived of law, family, custom, religion, and, of course, of all exchange of goods and services.   At the same time, of course, each will have the consolation of knowing that they are all trivial particles in a mighty collective organism now united with 'itself'...   As Rothbard writes  The eradication of the division of labour would quickly bring starvation and economic misery to all. The abolition of all structures of human interrelation would bring enormous social and spiritual deprivation to every person. And, even the alleged 'artistic' intellectual and creative development of all man's faculties in all directions would be totally crippled by the ban on all speciali zation. How can true intellectual development or creation come without concentrated effort? In short, the terrible economic suffering of mankind under communism would be fully matched by its intellectual and spiritual deprivation. Considering the nature and consequences of communism, to call this horrific dystopia a noble and 'humanist' ideal can at best be considered a grisly joke, in questionable taste."

masterflappie,2020-01-16 13:20:41,fejnjwq,t3_ep855k,t3_ep855k,"You can have a pretty free market while still having a nationalized healthcare, education etc. The ""free"" part of the market means that you can buy and sell whatever you want for whatever price you want. Nationalized institution require tax, so they don't directly hurt the free market, taxing people does mean that they have less to put into the market and that does hurt the market.  So why are free markets good? There's something called the invisible hand of the free market, the idea is that the free market tries to optimize itself for everyone involved. This optimization is done by the ""invisible hand"". Imagine that we have Alice and Bob. Both Alice and Bob have a shed to work raw materials with, but Alice has more woodworking tools and Bob has more metalworking tools. Then Charlie comes around with a bunch of wood and scrap metal. Both Alice and Bob want both the wood and the metal, because they can work it into something else and sell it with a profit. When Alice works wood however, because she has better tools, she can transform $10 of raw wood into $20 of processed wood, while Bob can only turn it into $15 of processed wood. Because Alice can make more profit, she can also pay a higher price for the wood. If Charlie increases the price of the wood, he might lose Bob as a customer but earn more because Alice pays more. Same goes for metal, but the other way around. This is the optimization of the free market. Because the invisible hand realized that Bob is inefficient at working wood, the price was raised to something where only efficient people will consume wood. The only way for Bob to join in again is by expanding his toolshed to be more productive. Say a hurricane hits and everyone needs to repair their homes, Charlie will again raise the price because that way he can make more money. That ensures that Alice will stop working wood because it became too expensive, so all available wood goes to the repair of the homes. Until the invisible hand realizes that the problem has past and the price of wood will drop again, at which point Alice can consume her work.  Now imagine we fix the price, because it's ""immoral"" for people to pay a lot for wood. Initially, both Alice and Bob will be consuming wood now because they can both pay for it. When before 100% of the wood was transformed into nice Alice chairs, now only 80% becomes nice Alice chairs while 20% becomes less nice Bob chairs. So straight away, our wood resource isn't being processed as well as it could be. But worse, when the hurricane hits, people will be able to buy wood at a cheap price, *if* there is any. It's possible that early in the morning Alice and Bob bought all the wood, because it didn't rise in price so why would Alice and Bob stop working? That would mean that the entire village can't use the wood for what they really want to use it, to repair homes. So the wood resource is not being used even less efficient. Normally, in a wood shortage, people buy wood elsewhere cheaply and sell it locally for a much higher price. That means people bring wood to places where there is a shortage, because they earn a profit for it. But because the wood price is fixed, wood is equally expensive anywhere, so no one ends up bringing wood to places where they need it, they would just lose time and gas.  So price fixing is manipulating the market, but so are permits for instance. Perhaps there was an ever better woodworker than Alice who could build even nicer chairs, thus is more efficient at working wood. If he doesn't have the money for a permit however, he never will, so our wood gets worked by someone less ideal. Again losing efficiency.  So I would say, decrease regulation during financially struggling times and increase it during financially prosperous times."

Class society dissapears and everyone being a scientist they will run the economy scientifically and own all the means of production collectively.  * Therefore labor becomes life's prime want, division of labor dissapears, intellectual labor takes over, science will be the focus of society, and the economy will be scientifically planned by the entire population to serve their needs, from each according to their ability to each according to their needs.

Yet the wealthy countries of the world became wealthy before they had large governments and no nation became rich with big government.  [Small Government Is the Recipe for Creating Rich Nations](https://youtu.be/aK3lyNR_vV8)  The reason there is a strong positive correlation between government size and GDP growth is that poor nations can't support big government. So if poor nations are included in studies it makes it look like there is a positive correlation between government size and growth. Of course it is obvious that poor nations can't support big government. The analogy is unhealthy hosts can only support small parasites. Healthy hosts can support larger parasites.  If only rich countries are included we can see a significant correlation between government size lower annual growth rate.  [Government Size and Growth: A Survey and Interpretation of the Evidence](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/81319/1/wp858.pdf) by Andreas Bergh and Magnus Henre  Abstract: The literature on the relationship between the size of government and economic growth is full of seemingly contradictory findings. This conflict is largely explained by variations in definitions and the countries studied. An alternative approach – of limiting the focus to studies of the relationship in rich countries, measuring government size as total taxes or total expenditure relative to GDP and relying on panel data estimations with variation over time – reveals a more consistent picture: The most recent studies find a significant negative correlation: An increase in government size by 10 percentage points is associated with a 0.5 to 1 percent lower annual growth rate. We discuss efforts to make sense of this correlation, and note several pitfalls involved in giving it a causal interpretation. Against this background, we discuss two explanations of why several countries with high taxes seem able to enjoy above average growth: One hypothesis is that countries with higher social trust levels are able to develop larger government sectors without harming the economy. Another explanation is that countries with large governments compensate for high taxes and spending by implementing market-friendly policies in other areas. Both explanations are supported by ongoing research.  Here is another study that shows the same results though the authors seem unhappy with their findings because they assert the results are due to endogeneity and reverse causality problems:  [Does Government Size Affect Per‐Capita Income Growth? A Hierarchical Meta‐Regression Analysis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1475-4932.12307)  Abstract: Since the late 1970s, the received wisdom has been that government size (measured as the ratio of total government expenditure to gross domestic product (GDP) or government consumption to GDP) is detrimental to economic growth. We conduct a hierarchical meta‐regression analysis of 799 effect‐size estimates reported in 87 primary studies to verify if this assertion is supported by existing evidence. Our findings indicate that the conventional prior belief is supported by evidence mainly from developed countries but not from less developed countries. We argue that the negative relationship between government size and economic growth in developed countries may reflect endogeneity bias.  Inequality is higher in countries with a bigger welfare state  [Private wealth across European countries: the role of income, inheritance and the welfare state](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp1847.en.pdf?13d96a943c5000b2a83cf8b9d3653605)  The measured inequality of wealth is higher in countries with a relatively more developed welfare state. Why is this the case? The substitution effect of welfare state expenditures with regard to private wealth holdings is significant along the full net wealth distribution, but is relatively lower at higher levels of net wealth. Given an increase in welfare state expenditure, the percentage decrease in net wealth of poorer households is relatively stronger than for households in the upper part of the wealth distribution. This finding implies that given an increase of welfare state expenditure, wealth inequality measured by standard relative inequality measures, such as the Gini-coefficient, ECB Working Paper 1847, September 20152 will increase.

I agree that they should leave hong kong alone, and they do have some imperialistic tendencies, but also, China was very poor until recently, as they continue to climb up in global power, I expect that they won't have to worry about India anymore, or the US fucking with them, and that should settle them down. I see them as global posturing, much the same way as the US and the EU have done. Otherwise, the worst things that they are doing at re-education camps, which are coming to the west soon in the name of ""re-educating"" right wingers. It won't be left wingers in camps, that's simply not the direction we're headed, but if you disagree, I'd like to hear ""why"".  &gt;The definition of racism is the ideology of prejudiced belief in racial hierarchies. If you believe your group to be superior, that still constitutes racism.  Agreed, that is a definition of racism that I would use too. But please recognize, I did not say ""belief that your group is superior"", but rather I said ""support for your racial group"". I think that members of a racial group can want to live among other members of the same group without harboring any hate for other groups. To me, it's like this, just because I don't want you to rent a room in my home, doesn't mean that I hate you. I have friends that wanted to live with me, but I knew that our diversity of opinions on several key issues would cause us to fight. I recognize that while we still like each other especially in shorter chunks of time, we wouldn't make great living partners because we want to live our lives in different ways.  Also, just for clarity, I do not envision an ethnostate being 100% of any racial group. Anyone from any group who wants to come to an ethnostate would be welcome, so long as there was room for them and that they are honest that they want to live like those in the ethnostate and adopt the culture of the ethnostate, and not want to push their own culture onto the ethnostate.  &gt;I never said it was.  I didn't mean to imply that this is what you believe, but it's clearly something that is happening within some smaller groups in the US, including majority white groups. It is certainly an element of the US's culture, and increasingly the entire west.  &gt;Those would be a very small radical minority.  I think it's more common than white supremacists. I think it white people spoke about black people the way that black people speak about white people, it would be immediately recognized as ""racist"". Further, it doesn't matter if it's small, I want to be away from these people, and I don't want to them to have an influence in my culture or society. They don't want to be near me because they hate me, and I don't want to be near them because I realize that there is nothing that I can do to get them to stop hating me: so my idea is that we should divorce, and be allowed to separate geographically, and governmentally.  &gt;However, said group is very small and not a large danger right now.  This is where we disagree. My question for you, is why do you think right wing politics is a danger? The majority of young people are left or left-leaning politically. The right leaning groups are all older, and are currently in the process of dying off. The country may have elected Trump, but to be fair, Hillary was a shitty candidate. We also may not quite be ready for someone as openly socialist as Bernie, but I see absolutely no reason to expect that we won't be there soon, especially in 20 years once a large chunk of the boomers have died. We also aren't getting any whiter, in fact, [non-hispanic whites are a minority right now in the Under 15 years old demographic in the United States](https://www.brookings.edu/research/less-than-half-of-us-children-under-15-are-white-census-shows/). Given that we are a democracy... how exactly do you think right wingers will be a danger? It seems to me, that the only way that they will be a danger is if they are refused to be allowed to govern themselves in their own space... which brings me back to my point, why not just let them? Give them an ethnostate, and all of this tension, all of these problems that you're worried about, they all immediately evaporate."

Also, in an ancap system, who offers to retrain these people?  &gt;AKA you're nothing but a dumbfuck student overpaying for a useless degree.  You didn't read the part about working, then. Also, I'd hardly say that a degree in mathematics is useless, companies will be able to quickly identify my skills via the verification it provides. Also, how am I overpaying for it?  &gt;A system that tells me I must be responsible for others against my consent is not a moral system at all. It's slavery.  Slavery is being forced to work involuntarily for someone else.  edit (because I forgot to elaborate): While *ostensibly* you do involuntarily work for someone else, slavery is when you have no moral responsibility to that person. This is much like how taxation isn't theft because theft has to be immoral and illegal, taxation is moral and legal. Taxation is in essence the state ensuring that you perform your obligations to other people. Human beings are a social species and require attention and care during various stages of their life. If I'm not responsible for you, I don't need to particularly care if the state is ""stealing"" from you, either.  &gt;Hey dumbass, how about you look 5 minutes into the future of such a  system. The lazy and selfish will just pump children out at unprecedented rates, and the productive will be forced to care for them all. How the fuck do you think such a thing is sustainable? It clearly isn't. Use your brain.  Explain how this system is already in place and is sustainable, then. In fact, the birthrate is relatively low.  &gt;You're the one threatening to go around killing people, dumbass.  Defending myself against a psychopathic murderer like you is perfectly  moral.  I'm not threatening to kill anyone. I'm trying to show through example that your system has no punishments for killing anyone via inaction. What difference is there between killing someone through action and inaction?  &gt;And it got that way through capitalism, you moron. You take away the capitalism, you take away the wealth too.  Why is it that the US doesn't have all this despite being far more deregulated?  What is there to stop the power vacuum from imploding in your system and making states out of corporations? Isn't a state just a corporation that lets you vote? I mean, sure, it also uses violence, but a corporation does that too when you're on their property. Why is it legitimate for you to own land, but a state can't?  What gives your claim to a property any legitimacy? The threat of *your* violence? Once again, are you going to stop sleeping and buy a bulletproof house? What about if people lay siege on you and you can't get food?  Once you own enough land and property, you can force people to work for you. If you own Iceland, anyone in Iceland will have to work for you or you'll just throw them into the ocean. I mean, with virtually any situation where one person owns something that is an absolute necessity to everyone else, you can hold everyone else hostage with it. What about having kids? Can people just starve and abuse their kids?  Can I privately own nuclear missiles? If so, what's to stop me from nuking everyone? If not, why not?  I don't see you solving any of this.  A state is the natural conclusion of people inhabiting the same overlapping space and needing to have an agreement of what is acceptable in that space and what isn't. It derives legitimacy directly from the people whom support it. In anarcho-capitalism, if someone has property, there is no reason for anyone else to recognize that property. In a statist society, they do; they support the state (and the parts that they don't, they're willing to work with as they have the right to engage in the decisionmaking process) and that state supports the property right."

It is certainly an element of the US's culture, and increasingly the entire west.   Sure, but *this* on the other hand find to be what you described as posturing earlier. There's lingering feelings of guilt in the white groups because they still benefit from the fact that their parents were the preferred group in their time (and increasingly so as you go into the past), and lingering feelings of bitterness in the minority groups because they still face issues that are the direct consequences of their parents being the subjugated group in the past. As this problem fades away and the groups intermix, there is no clear border or easy way to blame *""the other""*.   &gt;My question for you, is why do you think right wing politics is a danger?   This depends on your definition of right wing politics, but the ones that I do believe are a danger are mostly that way because there is no way of resolving them without violence as you can't ""stop being non-white"", and even with separation, violence would eventually follow as the other group becomes otherized. In economic terms the issue is somewhat similar, I can't regrow a leg if I've lost one, and disability benefits aren't usually high up on the list of right wing policies. I don't believe that the magnitude of any immediate forceful threat is high, though.  &gt;Give them an ethnostate, and all of this tension, all of these problems that you're worried about, they all immediately evaporate.

I don't know why this must be the case. When I watch the political primaries, I see even ideologically aligned groups infighting with each other. The idea that we're going to fight just because my culture is different than yours seems silly to me, so long as we can find a way to prevent or drastically limit the amount that my culture fucks with yours, and the amount that your culture fucks with mine.  &gt;If diversity means multiple separate incompatible systems, friction will arise and that generates conflict.  Agreed. And given that people aren't robots, having separate areas for different people who want to live different ways makes sense. If you get to live your life happily in one area, and I get to live my life happily in a different way and area, then we will have no need to fight with each other, because we are each happy in our own respective areas. Forcing people to be together when they don't want to be together is what causes the actual fighting.  Telling large groups of people that they aren't free to live the way that they want to live, is the worst thing that you can do.  &gt;If, however, diversity just means different skin colours, then that's about as irrelevant as people having different hair colours.  Agreed, skin color should be meaningless. However, if an ideology appears that worships certain skin colors over others, then it creates friction, and that can be racially based.  &gt;[The Chinese detention centers for the Uygurs] aren't re-education camps, they're killing people there.  If you're implying genocide, I see no evidence of that in the articles that I am reading, do you have a link?  Religion is something that divides us, as you said before, you believe that we all need to mix and integrate with each other to remove all of the fronts that divide us (we must destroy ideological diversity). Sounds to me like the Chinese are doing exactly what the US is going to have to do, but people into ""re-education camps"" until they agree to stop following whatever ideology that they were put in there for. What other solution do you see?  I see an alternative solution... let the Uygurs be Uygurs, but in their own area. If only half the population in that area wants to be muslim, then maybe the area should be divided, and people can migrate and separate. Divorce is preferable to this forced assimilation for the good of the future bullshit.  &gt;[Re-education camps] are not coming to the west either. There's really no indication of that.  How do you expect that the West will deal with white nationalists, white supremacists, and devoutly religious people, and any other group that doesn't want to live in the ideal culture that you want for the West?  &gt;That being said, the reason people want to live with their own group is largely due to the fact that people grow up in separate environments. People exposed to other races in their youth don't have this problem.  I'm skeptical of this claim. There are a lot of variables at play here, and I would assume that mixed communities also have more mixed cultures. How many people go from mixed communities to non-mixed communities? I would think studying that population would be rather interesting.  To be clear, I'm not calling you wrong, I'm saying that the data that I've seen hasn't convinced me that enough variables have been controlled for your conclusion to be reached.  &gt;There's lingering feelings of guilt in the white groups because they still benefit from the fact that their parents were the preferred group in their time (and increasingly so as you go into the past)  All cultures preferred their own cultures and own groups. Your conclusion is only reached is you use selective bias in your data to only look at examples where whites benefited in white areas. The Chinese do not feel guilty for wanting China to remain Chinese. The Israelis don't feel guilty for wanting Israel to remain Jewish. Whites only feel the way that they feel because they have been taught with highly biased sources to make them feel that way by not contextualizing the sins of their past with the sins of other groups past.  Put differently, what we teaching out kids is the equivalent to almost exclusively showing criminal reports on the news when the criminal is black. Although we all know that whites commit crimes too, the fact that the cases that we are constantly bombarded with involve a black person is naturally going to shape our perceptions about black people as a group.  In school, we disproportionately report on the sins of whites in the past, usually referring to it as ""our history"" even though most of the kids in grade school aren't non-hispanic white. As soon as it comes to teaching about a groups past sins, multiculturalism flies out the window. There's no multiculturalism in studying the bad things that happened in the past, it's a mono-culture.  This bias is self-perpetuating. More teaching kids that whites were uniquely bad creates more anti-white prejudice, which creates more people who push for more bias in the sources, which creates more anti-white prejudice. The cycle only gets worse.  Do you think Arab immigrants feel guilty that the Middle East bought over 10 times the number of African Slaves as the United States? Of course not. Arabs are not taught to feel guilty about taking Africans as slaves, so they don't, even though their ancestors were objectively worse by more than order of magnitude.  It is clear that even though non-hispanic whites below the age of 15 are minority, the cycle of anti-white prejudice is showing no signs of relenting, in fact, it is only growing. White people deserve, and need, a place that they can go to escape this prejudice.  &gt;but the ones that I do believe are a danger are mostly that way because there is no way of resolving them without violence as you can't ""stop being non-white""  You also can't stop ""being white"". If we stop disproportionately trying to make whites feel uniquely guilty for stuff that everyone was doing, racial tensions would heal, not worsen.   &gt;violence would eventually follow as the other group becomes otherized.  Why assume that groups will only fraction off? We know that many groups will fuse together. If other groups do become incompatible, then allow them to separate, or move to compatible areas. All we have to do to stop this kind of fighting is assert a global right for those who are not happy in a country to move to a country that they will be happy in. If you hate the country that you live in, then it should be a human right for you to be able to move to one that is run in a way that you will be happy. Don't you agree?  &gt;This always has been and always will be followed by violence towards other non-ethnostates.  Why would this be the case?  &gt;I don't care, nor would I if you were 95% white or 95% black.  The point was that your fear of white nationalism seems unfounded, given that we are a democracy and non-hispanic whites are now the minority for those under 15... why would a country that is majority non-white vote in favor of white nationalism?"

Gov't financing causes students to get useless degrees.  &gt;I agree with you on all the points about how shit current police are but private police has never worked properly, the only reson your role models are doing alright is because all the uncovered areas are still protected by regular police  We can use public funding for private police, no model of accomplishing this has unpoliced areas. Private security will be fired for infractions, impossible with public police, (and public educators, another failure).  &gt;Your evidence for public schools not educating is an account of a single woman whining about how she couldn't keep kids in check.

WSJ: ""Say we take it up to the top 10%, or everyone with income over $114,000, including joint filers. That’s five times Mr. Obama’s 2% promise. The IRS data are broken down at $100,000, yet taxing all income above that level throws up only $3.4 trillion. And remember, the top 10% already pay 69% of all total income taxes, while the top 5% pay more than all of the other 95%  We recognize that 2008 was a bad year for the economy and thus for tax receipts, as payments by the rich fell along with their income. So let’s perform the same exercise in 2005, a boom year and among the best ever for federal revenue. (Ahem, 2005 comes after the Bush tax cuts that Mr. Obama holds responsible for all the world’s problems.)  In 2005 the top 5% earned over $145,000. If you took all the income of people over $200,000, it would yield about $1.89 trillion, enough revenue to cover the 2012 bill for Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security—but not the same bill in 2016, as the costs of those entitlements are expected to grow rapidly. The rich, in short, aren’t nearly rich enough to finance Mr. Obama’s entitlement state ambitions—even before his healthcare plan kicks in. ""  Last year the President reduced taxes and US tax revenue increased--highest ever. That's just how it works.  We need to privatize all education. The empirical data of private education is overwhelming. People who defend public schools don't give a rat's ass about children."

With that being said I think you have a wrong concept on capitalism and that's why you think I'm pro-exploitation or whatever. The truth is that since the beginning of human kind to the 1800s 95% of the world's population was extremely poor living with less than a dollar a day, in just 200 years that number has reduced to just 5% of the population, and that is thanks to capitalism, not anything else.  Then we can discuss how to implement it, what I think is that it's impossible to control the market (because people is acting everywhere and anywhere) and it's totally safe because is based on self-interest (which we all have) and voluntarism: If you buy a product or service is because you think it will be beneficial to you, same if our agree to a job, you sign a contract and get a paycheck for the work you make. The beauty about capitalism (and the freer the better) is that when you are working you can start to save up and invest in your own business, to be totally free is to do whatever you want.  About the books there's a lot. If you look for refutations of types of collectivism there's a lot: There's The Human Action and Socialism by Ludwig Von Mises, The Fatal Conceit and The Road to Serfdom by Hayek and The Case Against Socialism by Rand Paul to name a few."

I didn't.  But yes, you still can compare the two.  If you determine them to be equal, your comparison may be incorrect... but you _can_ compare them as they are both qualitatively ""heads of state"" which will have political/moral repercussions.  &gt; The Superpower can act in a moralistic manner and retaliate in full force...  I don't know what you mean by ""moralistic manner.""  Retaliating in full force is not ""moral.""  Nuking Iran, assuming some Iranian terrorist killed Vice President Pence, is not morally justifiable.  &gt; ...the regional power has to consider its very fucking existence in every move it makes.  Yes, there are both moral implications for actions Iran takes that provoke the US as well as the US's actions... and?  &gt; What would make a superpower go to war is far less than a regional power when up against a superpower.   Sure, but that says nothing about the morality of the thing.  That's the political question, and as I said, I agree they are politically unequal.  But being politically unequal, while it may be less disastrous for the US to kill their second than it would be for them to kill our second, does not mean it is not politically disastrous.  &gt; Saying that killing Soleimani is an act of war as killing Mike Pence would be...  I did not say anything about Mike Pence.  Whether or not ""killing Soleimani"" is an act of war is a totally separate question from whether or not it is ""an act of war as killing Mike Pence would be.""  To continue the steak analogy... it is not requisite upon me (nor have I done so) to say that eating the fattier steak will put you _more_ over your required calories for the day in order to say that eating the less fattier steak will also put you over your calories.  &gt; ...is completely ignoring the fact that Iran isn’t suicidal and doesn’t want to end up like Iraq, or Libya, or Syria.  If you think I was trying to imply Iran was suicidal, you're mistaken.  What I was trying to imply is that Trump is 100% an unpredictable narcissist who, no matter what precaution Iran takes (aside from doing absolutely nothing in response), may well use _any_ responsive action for pretense for war."

The current model seems to be working; we leave people alone.  &gt;How do you expect that the West will deal with white nationalists, white  supremacists, and devoutly religious people, and any other group that  doesn't want to live in the ideal culture that you want for the West?   White nationalism and white supremacy *as a thought* will be accepted on the grounds that thought crime isn't a thing, but most action advancing said ideology tends to be violent and as such illegal. Devoutly religious people can practice their religion as long as they don't break the law.  &gt; All cultures preferred their own cultures and own groups. Your conclusion is only reached is you use selective bias \[...\]  This bias is self-perpetuating.    My conclusion was a specific case scenario, so there wasn't so much a selective bias as that the selection was the point. I'm talking about America, mostly.  &gt;Do you think Arab immigrants feel guilty that the Middle East bought  over 10 times the number of African Slaves as the United States? Of  course not. Arabs are not taught to feel guilty about taking Africans as  slaves, so they don't, even though their ancestors were objectively  worse by more than order of magnitude. \[Similar arguments about Israel and China\]  Your many arguments of guilt are descriptive, not prescriptive.  &gt;\[...\] the cycle of anti-white prejudice is showing no signs of relenting, in fact, it is only growing.   How does it manifest? I don't see evidence of this. It's being given a spotlight by media and YouTube because it gets clicks and feeds the algorithms, but it isn't a growing phenomenon of violence, for example.   &gt; I'm skeptical of this claim \[integration via childhood desensitization\].   A quick Google search finds [this](https://theconversation.com/face-time-heres-how-infants-learn-from-facial-expressions-53327), I don't remember where my original source is. *""infants prefer the faces of their own race by three months of age* \[...\] *The good news is that exposure to people from other races on a daily basis can erase this effect.""*  While this effect seems inborn, it does wear off with exposure.  &gt; How many people go from mixed communities to non-mixed communities?   It does certainly happen, but the numbers aren't clear to me.  &gt; All cultures preferred their own cultures and own groups.    This is due to heuristic reasons, and isn't necessarily validated by actual modern realities as a good reflex or intuition to have.  &gt;If you hate the country that you live in, then it should be a human right for you to be able to move to one that is run in a way that you will be happy. Don't you agree?   No. There is no guarantee for such a nation to even exist, nor is it a human right for people to form nations over ethnic reasons.  &gt; The point was that your fear of white nationalism seems unfounded \[...\]  It isn't a massive problem compared to many others, sure. It is still *a* problem. I am taking the proportion into account.  TL;DR Let people live the way they want to insofar as their culture is moral. Try to integrate the world into one single global community (although people can live in whatever areas they want to). As for what is moral, I'd define most Western nations to have a good enough grasp, the long explanation is just that; long. I'd say Sam Harris' The Moral Landscape is a good enough rough approximation of what I'm going for, based on what I've heard of it anyway.  Our posts are getting increasingly longer, so do say if I missed something. I'm pretty tired for whatever reason today, so I wouldn't be surprised."

Every attempt at central planning, or material balance planning in the soviet style, had to revert back to open markets under pressure from inside and outside. It failed so bad, Stalin lied through his teeth in 1936 saying classes were abolished and Krushy had the balls to say communism would be reached by the 80's.   Well Stalin technically didnt say that classes were abolished, he said that workers , peasants and intellectuals rule the USSR, which is kind of a lie because while these 3 classes exist, there was also a 4th class ( or perhaps only 2 antagonistic classes viewed from a different dimension) which was the CPSU membership which stood in direct antagonism with regular workers.

If the boat can be safely navigated through the icebergs then it will be smooth, but if it hits an iceberg and sinks then people will be angry and will fight for survival.  I think Hegel was much more clear here and Marx didn't study Hegel pretty well, he was a Young Hegelian, whereas the Old Hegelians had a much more in-depth knowledge about how society changes.  Nontheless Marxist economics is still spot on, and most of his observations still hold true to this day.  &gt; If it's a people who favor decentralization then sweet, but if it's a people who favor hierarchy . . .

For example, I have no problem with a country requiring you to stay in a concentration camp as part of your voluntary immigration process, while they vet you to make sure that you will actually be happy in that country.  That being said, I do condemn what the Chinese are doing, and think that they need to find a solution that allows the Uygurs to be separate from China. I also think that your link about the scholar doesn't really satisfy me. It does not seem to indicate genocide as I think you were implying, and deaths in custody do happen even if you are doing everything fairly.  &gt;The current model seems to be working; we leave people alone.  But you're not leaving people alone. You're implementing laws and rules that many do not agree with, and never agreed with, and imposing changes that many don't want. The fact that now have a diverse set of two distinct and incompatible cultures is indicative that one side will always be unhappy, and really, both will be unhappy until we get the divorce over with. If we can't agree on how to govern ourselves, we should separate, that way more people will be able to be happy with their government.  &gt;My conclusion was a specific case scenario  But that scenario was based off cruelly teaching kids about data that is strategically and specifically selected to a group with certain innate and uncontrollable characteristics feel guilty about doing things that other people did, often times to a much worse effect.  You said that white kids feel guilty about slavery, and that's true, but Arabs don't feel guilty, even though they come from a culture that took on 10 times the number of slaves. The reason for this is because we teach all cultures, including Arabs to be angry with whites, even when whites were not the worst offenders. To accomplish this, we simply ignore and strike out the sins of other cultures from our history books so that the selection of sins is focused solely on whites, which naturally gives the impression that whites must have been uniquely evil.  &gt;It's being given a spotlight by media and YouTube because it gets clicks and feeds the algorithms, but it isn't a growing phenomenon of violence, for example.  And why does it generate clicks? I would argue because it helps to feed the narrative of hate against whites. People are thirsting for justification for their hate of whites.  Who is tracking anti-white hate crimes, and how do they define them?  I would think that any group specifically looking at hate crimes against whites would be instantly labelled a racist organization by those who worry that looking into this data could cause ""racist thoughts"".  &gt;No. There is no guarantee for such a nation to even exist, nor is it a human right for people to form nations over ethnic reasons.  It absolutely is, and was throughout all of history. To deny a peoples their right to govern themselves is cruel. Why should you get to impose your will upon a significant group of those united by different ideals who do not wish to have you lording over them?  I don't think every individual should get their own nation, but the largest groups, be they cultural, ethnic, religious, or otherwise ideological, should all have a place where they can live in peace from foreign interference, so long as they allow those who want to leave their group the freedom to leave.   &gt;TL;DR Let people live the way they want to insofar as their culture is moral.  Completely agreed. The fact that the Arab slave trade took on over 10 times the number of slaves as the Atlantic slave trade means that whites should spend 10 times the time learning about the Arab slave trade than they do learning about the Atlantic slave trade. Picking and choosing sins of the past so that we teach all groups to hate just one is immoral. This is why I speak out against the American (and other Western) government(s).  &gt;Try to integrate the world into one single global community (although people can live in whatever areas they want to).  You have no intentions of assimilating into my groups culture or my groups ideals, even if I were to accept globalism.

In [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory) this is analyzed for instance in the [game of chicken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_chicken).

Humor me.  Nationalism is a capitalist relic. It cant exist in communism as countries and nations will not exist there. It will be just 1 homogenous human race, culturally, linguisticaly, economically and even biologically. I think a communist human will be a complete mixture of all of the nations and cultures that exist today: everyone will speak 1 language, be a light brown skinned person who will have genes from all ethnicities on the planet through inter-breeding of various groups of people, have the same culture and live in the same world commune sharing all the property like a swarm of ants. So to think that small communities and cultures and languages will persist is funny, they will eventually be integrated.   That is why I prefer English, it's a very simple language and easy to use whereas other languages are hard to express yourself in and have a shitty grammer structure. Although with the fading of the Anglo-saxon world, I dont know if English will be the one. And I really hope it won't be Mandarin lol, that language is just a mess, those symbols are horrible.

I would have believed it if it would be from like 1950 where ""socialism was advanced"", but in 1936 it was certainly silly. Not like they eliminated it by 1950 but at least by then he could have claimed that the farming reforms were completed and they could move further.  &gt; Nations existed before capitalism  Depends how you define a nation. Ironically it was Stalin who defined it as a group with the same language and traditions, which is pretty vague. I mean tribes had their own languages and tradictions, were they a nation? No.   The modern nation as such only exists since capitalism, since by then it was setup to be the symbol of the aggregate private property belonging to a capitalist group, and all the features and traditions by which it emerged.   Ironically as capitalism cuts through the bullshit, it becomes more and more uniform, and creates a global common culture. As Marx put it it destroys the holy religious relationships,  sentimental family ties and changes it to mere money- relations. Such rich cultures as Japan or Turkey or Netherlands, are now basically just business entities with the same culture, buying commodities. The traditional dressings, music, cuisine, is just replaced with everyone wearing jeans and mini skirts, listening to Justin Bieber, and eating Hamburgers. The last domino is the language. When that falls, it will be useless to separate these entities by borders. Also capital is also expanding due to globalization, capitalists are inter-merging giving rise to superstates like the EU or the USA. Eventually it will merge into 1.  &gt; Yea I agree with everything else you said, but I'm talking about right now.  You'd be shocked how quickly the world changes. Like if you are not familiar with foreign cultures and you only saw them in old movies you'd be shocked how quickly they have adapted. Like I remember watching movies about Africa from the 70's and it just showed primitive tribes and wars, but today you have basically skyscrapers, roads, modern cars, stores, McDonalds, etc... your average African town looks like your average US town. Same with the rest of the world including the Islamic world (at least some of it except Saudi Arabia perhaps but even they have integrated into capitalism, they just have a problem implementing the universal human rights part).  &gt;  The whole world would be like one big nation, with one strand of Nationalism for All.  But that is not a nation that will be a world commune, and with that expanded consciousness we would also reject Anthropocentrism. After all becoming human supremacist is not consistent with the leftist view. So we would also be more considerate towards other living beings on the planet. We would have a symbiotic friendly relationship with animals too instead of exploiting them (carnivorism) or petting them (enslavement for own pleasure)."

What  benefit would that have on the economy other than the dogmatic statement  “private more efficient” because if we use the US healthcare industry  as an example, it’s incredibly bloated and inefficient compared to  Europe and Canada where we have stable, Efficient public healthcare.   Sticking to US healthcare as an example, an actual privatized system of healthcare would drop prices through the floor while improving service.   First it is important to understand that we need a market in healthcare not simply for it to be ran by ""companies"" instead of governments. Currently US healthcare is practically speaking ran by the government but in a very inefficient way.   The topic is actually pretty massive but I would refer you to this [podcast](https://www.econtalk.org/keith-smith-on-free-market-health-care/) to get an intro. The person being interviewed runs an actual, mostly, free market hospital but is still handicapped by prevailing regulations &amp; norms.   His form of operation should be looked at as the baseline for a market based healthcare system. But it could get a lot better over time as innovation was allowed to operate.   We can go deeper down the economic rabbit hole and discuss why nationalization doesn't really work due to lack of prices and the rejection of entrepreneurship as well."

Stop trying to make everyone else do it when you won't.  &gt; This is much like how taxation isn't theft because theft has to be immoral and illegal, taxation is moral and legal.

Lenin was a believer in Marxism but he distorted Marx's words dishonestly to fit into his narrative and to consolidate power. Stalin was probably even a bigger fanatic than he was and wanted a bigger legacy for himself so he committed these outrageous things, and the entire style of the USSR was shaped by him, these massive buildings, heavy industry, etc... but no substance beneath. Ironicaly this is how Liberalism works too, strong and powerful on the outside but no substance in the inside.  They might have believed in Marxism, or their distorted view of it, but there was no chance they would bring communism even if it had been possible (it was not) they wouldnt have let go of their power. It was just not possible to turn the USSR into a communist paradise.  &gt; Lenin's speeches before and after 1917 give the impression communism was like right there  I read somewhere that he was very depressed later that it was not created and he had to retreat into the NEP policy, which is probably what caused his bad health. He believed that he could do it and then worked hard all his life, seized power and then nothing communism was still centuries far. So Stalin as the macho guy thought that he could do it, and then embarked on an outrageous and extravagant mission to do it, of course failing to do it, but create a police state to make everyone believe that it's true and anyone who realized the truth had to be punished for it.  &gt; Maybe Krushy kinda believed the bs he was spitting.   Doubt it, Kruschev was certainly not a Marxist and probably never even read him. He was a con artist who only seized power due to maneuvering and his fame from WW2. He wanted a legacy for himself so he denounced his old boss and gave himself an image as the guy who opens up to the west.  Brezhnev was just your average incompetent bureaucrat, he didnt do much but the USSR deteriorated heavily under him but he didnt care at all.   Then Gorbachev was the final nail in the coffin, and incompetent idiot who was a complete idealist who never read Marx and even publicly admitted it, and he didnt even wanted to create communism, and he publicly flaunted these views. The USSR by then was so degenerated that it was impossible to save or reform or anything.  &gt; No, no, it is Cultural Capitalism which turns men into girls; since in capitalism everything must be commodified to produce money, and what better way to make more money than to sell that nail polish to girls and boys  I think it's more than that, if all divisions end in communism, would it be crazy to assume that sex division ends too, like male and female? Could we have instant transition between the sexes or perhaps an unisex? Keep in mind many plants have dual sexes it impregnates itself, no need for female and male part. Who knows?  &gt; We have no idea my guy  Well they say that humans are inherently more valuable since we are more advanced, and from a material standpoint. Our brains are really the pinnacle of material evolution, there is nothing in the known universe as complex as the human brain. So we are inherently more valuable but we could use our knowledge to help animals too.   Perhaps after we reach communism we can help to design (with gene editing) intelligent animals too, give them the ability to talk and think, and raise them to our level. That would be awesome but maybe a bit too sci-fi."

No, because what I'm proposing is a completely different thing. I'm saying that you have valid moral responsibilities for other people. In slavery you don't have a valid moral responsibility to your owner as a human being cannot own another. In the real world you do, however, have a valid moral responsibility to other people. This is because you inhabit the same space as they do, and without fulfilling your responsibilities, they have no reason to cooperate with you. If you fulfilled your responsibilities here and then were to live in outer space or something (speaking of which, you should try EvE Online, it's literally anarcho-capitalism in outer space: the game), then that's fine. You wouldn't have responsibilities there.   &gt; Stop trying to make everyone else do it when you won't.   I already explained that I *am* doing my part, and I also explained *how* I'm doing it (and I never said you need to *give* someone a house).  &gt;So according to you the holocaust wasn't murder because murder has to be  illegal?

The holocaust was legal, but *not moral*, so it was still murder.  &gt; So Hitler did nothing wrong? Dumbass.   One has to wonder why you have such anger management problems considering the sheer volley of ad hominems you're deploying here.  &gt;It fucking isn't. Dumbass. The fact that something has not yet collapsed doesn't mean it's sustainable.   It's been around for a century or so in various forms and its Debt-to-GDP has decreased in the recent years. The necessary modifications to the system are relatively minimal and several variables are going to improve in the future such as the age structure, which is expected to stabilize over the next few decades.   &gt;Draw a line with a negative slope. Will the line eventually be negative? But what if it's not negative yet? It must never go negative!   The Debt-to-GDP has a negative derivative and a negative second degree derivative. In other words, the debt is decreasing in relation to the GDP, and the rate of decrease is accelerating. In addition, *most* countries have a lot of debt. We're managing ours pretty well in comparison to many others.  &gt;Yes you did, lying shitbag.

The whole point is the minimal imposing of social will upon others. I'm not here to tell people what culture they should be a part of. I'm here to tell them that they get to be a part of any culture. I'm here to tell them that they don't get to make that choice for others just as much as I don't.   I mean, how do you expect inter-group violence to emerge when this is fine? If it does emerge, isn't it the fault of the person who starts the fight? Can't we just imprison those who generate that friction?"

His_Hands_Are_Small,2020-01-17 06:43:00,fem8abk,t3_eoay3n,t1_felyq3m,"&gt;I'm not saying there are mass murders, I'm saying that the conditions there are hardly ethical.  That's fair, and I do agree with you. We both definitely agree that ""re-education camps"" are unethical and should not exist. How would you propose a nation deal with a minority group that is radicalizing itself and desiring either separation from the majority or assimilation of the majority to the minority culture/ideology?  &gt;The laws are fairly minimal.  The white voters have voted majority republican in almost every single election in the last 40 years. If national laws had never changed to allow immigration changes that would guarantee major demographic changes which would lead to whites becoming a minority in their own country, to the extent where non-Hispanic whites are already a minority for people under 15, we would have a radically different political landscape, country and culture right now. The cultural aspect of this is massive.  &gt;I think it's largely that we're not focusing on Arabic history as we're not in Arabia.  Many people in America are from Arabia, and they certainly aren't being made to feel shame about slavery in Arabic history. We may not be in Arabia, but if we're going to assert that we are multicultural, we should be learning about them, and that means talking about slavery there 10 times more than we talk about it here to help contextualize how each of our multiple cultures had sins in their past.   &gt;No, I don't. The idea is not to assimilate to any given culture, but to create the minimal necessary laws to make sure that you can voluntarily live by any culture you want.  If two groups don't want to live with each other, then how do you accomplish this goal?  Let me put it this way, do you want to live with racists? They probably don't want to live with you. How do you benefit from having racists in your society? If you don't benefit, and if they are slowing down your progress to a utopia, why not just create a sort of concentration nation, where all of the racists can go, and that way they are out of your hair forever. You can think of them just as much as you think of the people in Senegal, which is probably almost never. Seems like a win/win to me.  &gt;No. The idea is to resolve the conflicts between the groups by ensuring maximal social freedom. This way you can wear a hijab, but you're not mandated to. It's the opposite of imposing a will or ideal upon others.  In order to accomplish maximum social freedom, you need to either b exist in a post-scarcity society, or have a mind control machine or some kind of medicine that completely dulls the minds of the public. People notice patterns. They will notice when certain groups of people who share a common culture are ""exercising social freedom"" and also failing to accomplish as much work as people not engaging in said ""social freedom"". For example, people might notice that those who use methamphetamine aren't accomplishing their responsibilities as well as those who don't use methamphetamine. This will cause people to speak out that such a social freedom is negative for society, and will cause us to make laws around it.  Drugs are pretty easy, but drugs aren't the only thing that causes negative things in society. For example, we know that increasing our number of sexual partners also increases our divorce rates. The more partners that you have, the more likely you are to get a divorce. We know that divorce is bad for children, and that the aggregate children in an intact nuclear family outpreform their aggregate counterparts who are living with single parents in just about every metric that we can think of. I think it's reasonable that a society might someday create moral panic about that.  Right now we have a lot of moral panic about words, probably the worst moral panic that I've ever lived through, and I lived through religious moral panic in the 90's and early 2000's. People are asserting that words can hurt (to be fair, I agree with them), but it necessarily means that we need to restrict freedom of speech. I cannot think of any power, not even wealth, that is more guaranteed to corrupt than the power to be the arbiter of what ideas can be shared, and which ideas can't. Every organization which gets that power inevitably will end up declaring that criticism of said organization becomes ""hate speech"".  &gt;I mean, how do you expect inter-group violence to emerge when this is fine?  Only responding to this so that you don't think I prematurely stopped reading. The answer to this is my last 3 paragraphs.  &gt;If it does emerge, isn't it the fault of the person who starts the fight? Can't we just imprison those who generate that friction?  Because who started the friction is often not easy to determine. If you lounge around all day, and aren't contributing to society, and I say to you that you aren't pulling your weight, did I start the friction, or did you?"

They started the friction and they need to be dealt with through the law.   &gt;\[Demographic changes and whites voting Republican\]  I don't see the point in what you're trying to say there. The demographic changes do impact voting, but what specific consequence are you trying to look at?  &gt;Many people in America are from Arabia, \[...\] sins in their past.   I see it as a national thing, nations have to focus on their own history the most. That being said, yes, that history should also be explored.  &gt;If two groups don't want to live with each other, then how do you accomplish this goal?   They have to ignore the other group or just not start the friction. Over time prejudices will fade away.  &gt;In order to accomplish maximum social freedom, you need to either b exist in a post-scarcity society \[...\]  That would eventually be the goal, and it is what we're approaching. That being said, no. All you need is to reach a point where human beings stop worrying about their economic future. This is probably the primary inflection point.  &gt;\[Exercising social freedom\] will cause people to speak out that such a social freedom is negative for society, and will cause us to make laws around it.   This is where my personal principles come in and say that we shouldn't *and* we should explain why it's wrong and won't help. If your argument is that people may not be receptive to that information, I hear you. I don't think that we can't overcome that problem, though.  &gt;For example, we know that increasing our number of sexual partners also  increases our divorce rates. The more partners that you have, the more  likely you are to get a divorce.   We don't know if one causes the other, though. It might be that there's just some sort of predisposition in a group X that causes said people to seek many sexual partners AND to be less interested in any single relationship. It isn't necessarily that having many sexual partners makes you less interested in remaining in relationships.   Nonetheless, what actually matters is that you can't force people to stay in relationships or to have less sexual partners. It's immoral and unenforceable. If it causes problems, people should be told, and they will naturally begin avoiding it.  &gt;Because who started the friction is often not easy to determine. If you  lounge around all day, and aren't contributing to society, and I say to you that you aren't pulling your weight, did I start the friction, or did you?   There are proper channels for this.   * You tell me that I'm not pulling my weight. This is fine. * You start an investigation into why people in general don't pull their weight and then publish the results. This is fine. * You try to start a discussion about this. This is fine. * If illegal action is taking place, channels exist for that. This is fine. * You punch me because I'm not pulling my weight. This is crossing the line. * You tell me that I'm not pulling my weight, and I punch you. This is crossing the line.  I hope this helps in extrapolating what I mean."

Imagine seizing the state, spilling blood, and your dream doesnt come true. Blyat.

All that violence and ultra-left strategies and then nothing good came out of that and then they went ultra-right to compensate for their lack of success. Neither of it would have led to communism since the material conditions werent sufficient, but had they stayed in the center it would have caused much much less casualties.  &gt; Bro if we can grow an ear on a mouse in 20th century, we better have some beautiful boi pucci by 22nd century.

Right, so had those workers not been there, those guys could've done it all by themselves?   &gt; Aka not an example at all.   Alright, how about [this](https://projects.cberdata.org/reports/MfgReality.pdf).  *""A closer examination of productivity yields some interesting insights as well. In 1998, the inflation-adjusted output per worker was much lower than it is today. This is due to a variety of factors, chief among them being the automation and information technology advances absorbed by these sectors over this time period.""*  *""Had we kept 2000-levels of productivity and applied them to 2010-levels of production, we would have required 20.9 million manufacturing workers. Instead, we employed only 12.1 million.""*  That being said, it's practically impossible to find *exactly* what the numbers are. Corporations don't like talking about firing people because of automation, so there is no clear report of ""this many jobs were lost due to automation"". You're free to prove me wrong by finding the relevant sources yourself.   That being said, the automation point is a bit moot here. Automation is still going to come. The exact point at which it arrives, on which I may even have been wrong, is irrelevant. If you don't think we're responsible for other people, then I have no reason to move on with this argument. The original reason I mentioned it isn't applicable anyways for just that reason.   &gt;No it fucking isn't. You demand that the fruits of my labor go to others who refuse to labor at all. That's exactly slavery. There are no clever word games you can play to get around it.   And you killing someone in a premeditated fashion during self-defence is murder? See, it isn't *word games*. I'm using the definitions of the words and basic moral theory to explain how there is a difference between taxation and slavery.  Murder is when someone immorally kills someone in a premeditated fashion. In self-defence, however, killing someone, even in a premeditated fashion, is not considered murder. This is purely because of moral reasons.   Slavery is when someone immorally takes control of someone else and demands that they work for them. Taxation is when someone morally allows full autonomy as long as they contribute their fair share to the upholding of the society they live in. It is the demand that you fulfill your responsibilities to your fellow citizens. This is purely because of moral reasons.  &gt; No you aren't. You aren't giving away free housing at all.   Considering my circumstances and most importantly the fact that I'm in my early twenties, it's not reasonably possible to earn enough to do *that*. What I *can* do is work, help those around me by whatever means I do have, and study so that I can work more efficiently in the future and pay my taxes. I am living by my principles.   &gt;The German government claimed it was moral. Who are you to say otherwise?   The victims of the holocaust had not commited any offenses towards anyone that warranted the actions taken by Nazi Germany. The death penalty is questionable as is, regardless of whether you're on the left (death penalties are immoral and the criminal could be rehabilitated) or right (death penalties are too quick and the criminal would suffer more as a living example of failure in a cell).  Then comes the question of what is the purpose of a justice system; rehabilitation, punishment and detainment. An attempt is made to improve the criminal's behaviour for the sake of the criminal and the society from which he has been temporarily removed. Punishment is done to disincentivize the action and to grant a sense of justice to the victims of the crimes. As the said criminal is a threat to society, they are removed from it so that they cannot do more damage.   Not necessarily all criminals fall into all three categories; we may not expect psychopaths to be rehabilitated, the mentally ill may be detained in separate facilities despite not being truly responsible for their actions, and sometimes a criminal isn't so dangerous as to require detainment, but the detainment is used as a punishment nonetheless.  However, the victims of the Holocaust had not commited actions that required rehabilitation, punishment or detainment. They met none of the categories. As such, detaining, punishing or killing them would have been immoral given the circumstances.  &gt; Universal healthcare has been around for a century or so?   If you read that part again, the word ""it"" clearly refers to the same thing in both sentences; Finland, not universal healthcare. That being said, the country has had a strong history of solidarity, stability and trust in the state. In an effort to unite the country after a civil war, policies were implemented that appeased the political left. The course had been set very early in the nation's history. Universal healthcare appeared practically as soon as it could from that.   &gt; No, it's called a threat.   I explained in detail how you're wrong. I *asked* you a *question*. If one *were* to live in your society, what would there be to stop people from murdering each other? If my formulation of the question was unclear, I apologize.  Well, on to the next part. I said that Finland, *in relation* to the US, has a deregulated economy. You replied:  &gt; No it fucking isn't.   And then you linked to what you believe to be a good source of information regarding the topic. The US is ranked at 12. place, Finland is ranked at 20. This contradicts your point. Hong Kong and Singapore both have extensive public healthcare, Singapore's being universal. They're both at the top of your economic freedom index. If you look at a map of countries with universal healthcare and the countries with a high economic freedom index, you'll find that virtually every country with a high index for economic freedom also has some form of universal healthcare. Virtually all the countries with high GDP per capita also have a form of universal healthcare. The only exception I'm able to notice after a quick search is the US. In addition, two of some of the best indicators for national stability are income equality and a social safety net.   With that out of the way, let's talk about the other issue we've been having. With virtually every point you make, you follow it with an ad hominem and you refuse to address my arguments against anarcho-capitalism. I'd like to think I've entertained your ideas and argued with good faith for as long as I have patience for, but even my patience goes so far.   You're clearly angry. I don't understand why you're so emotionally invested in this. I am not a person with any ill will towards you, I just disagree with you. Think about that for a moment.   Then, my final point. I'm going to request that you cease using insults, you begin arguing with good faith, and you respond to my points against anarcho-capitalism. If you won't, I will not respond to your messages. I have a feeling that you're going to let your pride take over and you're going to insult me, then see that I indeed will not respond, and then you're going to think you've won and you'll have a metaphorical parade about it.   Maybe you actually are a mature person, and you're having a rough time, or you're just emotionally invested in this. I don't know you, and I don't know your reasons. However, you can prove the opposite to me by just agreeing to my requests, which I view as fully reasonable; don't needlessly insult me, address my points against anarcho-capitalism, and *most importantly* argue with good faith.  See, it's not that I'm offended. This is the internet, I've been here for many, many years now, and I'm used to it. It's that I have no reason to believe you are actually entertaining any of my ideas if all you do is insult me. I have no reason to believe you're a mature person capable of multifaceted thought or recognizing the complexity of the issues at hand. Whatever you do, I really, genuinely mean you no ill will and hope you have a good life."

That's what I expected, but what actions would the law take to solve this problem?  So it sounds like we're no longer in agreement that China is wrong to put Muslims in ""re-education camps"", since the Muslims and other groups don't want to be a part of China. It sounds like you believe that China should forcefully assimilate other groups that don't want to be a part of China because it will reduce diversity, which will help reduce friction in the past. Am I correct?  &gt;The demographic changes do impact voting, but what specific consequence are you trying to look at?  If the US was as white today as it was in 1960, Obama would never have been president, and probably Trump would never have won the primaries. We wouldn't be as divided today, since **div**ersity causes **div**ision. Demographic changes have consequences, almost always negative.  &gt;I see it as a national thing, nations have to focus on their own history the most.  But what happened to us being a nation of immigrants though? Our history is world history, is it not?  Additionally, if we only focused on our nations history, that could be manipulated via revolution. If we severed, and broke into two separate nations, we wouldn't teach only about our new nations, we would obviously include about the past and of the United States, even though in that scenario the United States wouldn't exist anymore. This should be sufficient to demonstrate that we always talk more about the past of the people, not just the nation, and it's also why we learn about the Ancient Greeks, the Napoleonic Wars, Julius Ceaser, etc. in American schools. Historically, we focused on European history, since we were a nation of mostly Europeans, but now that we are transitioning from a nation of European immigrants to a nation of world immigrants, we should expand our history to focus on the world.  &gt;They have to ignore the other group or just not start the friction. Over time prejudices will fade away.  This doesn't answer the question of who started the friction.  &gt;All you need is to reach a point where human beings stop worrying about their economic future.  There are a lot of people in the US that are at zero risk of becoming homeless or not having food, and yet, they are still very angry at other groups. Think about it differently, don't you have disagreements with other people that aren't caused by your economic situation? People have problems with each other, some people are just dicks in general. People also gravitate towards like minded people. All over the world, like minded groups with slightly different ideas have formed around each other, and have build up environments conducive to their own beliefs.  &gt;It might be that there's just some sort of predisposition in a group X that causes said people to seek many sexual partners AND to be less interested in any single relationship.  This is a segway argument and our responses are long enough. All I'll say on the matter you're suspicion is correct, and others also realized this, so we now have data to support this trend that is cross cultural, meaning that social factors should be accounted for.   &gt;Nonetheless, what actually matters is that you can't force people to stay in relationships or to have less sexual partners. It's immoral and unenforceable.  Why is that unenforcable, but forcing people to want to live around others who disagree with their way of life is enforceable?   &gt;You tell me that I'm not pulling my weight. This is fine.  But surely you recognize that being told that you aren't pulling your weight will be considered offensive to some people, right? A lot of people would feel like being told that they aren't pulling their weight is ""creating friction"". If you doubt this, go find the person at your work who you think works the least hard, and tell them that they are working the least hard out of everyone, tell me how it goes.   &gt;If illegal action is taking place, channels exist for that. This is fine.  This seems like the only actual answer in your list of ""fine"" actions to take.

BajES,2020-01-17 17:52:24,fenfg84,t3_eoay3n,t1_fen189r,"&gt;It sounds like you believe that China should forcefully assimilate other  groups that don't want to be a part of China because it will reduce diversity, which will help reduce friction in the past. Am I correct?   China is hardly a model for a moral nation, but assuming the same situation happened here, we'd have to look at whether those people commited crimes. If so, they go to prison. If they didn't, they may have to be monitored if they're a risk group, but they would go free.  &gt;\[...\] now that we are transitioning from a nation of European immigrants to a  nation of world immigrants, we should expand our history to focus on the  world.   Ostensibly, sure. The factors of ""how much"", though, would have to depend on how local the issue is. Obviously you learn more about US history than Asian history because you are located in and are part of the same continuum as the US. That being said, the more diverse the US gets, the more it should teach about the various ethnicities that have entered.  &gt; This doesn't answer the question of who started the friction.   The person who broke the law.  &gt;There are a lot of people in the US that are at zero risk of becoming  homeless or not having food, and yet, they are still very angry at other  groups.    Their economic future is still in doubt if the situation continues to escalate. Their safety, from a legal point of view, is in doubt if crime increases, which seem to be the primary two beliefs. People eating different foods or liking different types of music or stories don't have as much of an impact.  &gt;Why is that unenforcable, but forcing people to want to live around others who disagree with their way of life is enforceable?   Because if it were to be made a crime, the people who would participate would both keep their mouths shut in most cases. If you start friction with another group (by breaking the law), you're going to be found out and punished.  &gt;But surely you recognize that being told that you aren't pulling your weight will be considered offensive to some people, right?   Offensive, sure. Illegal, no. Well, as long as it doesn't become harassment.  &gt;If you doubt this, go find the person at your work who you think works the least hard, and tell them that they are working the least hard out  of everyone, tell me how it goes.   If it were me specifically, I'd be fine, I've had a long experience of being a sort of diplomat in various circumstances. It's a long story. However...  &gt;So basically, if you don't think that I am working hard enough, you would have to tattle tail on me to the state, or some other enforcement entity, and they would investigate me and use force against me if necessary.   ...it's that, sort of. If you're working for the state, then ostensibly this, but likely you'd be talking to your boss in either case. As long as there is a clear and proper channel on what to do and as long as you fulfill your part, then you're fine. If someone doesn't do their part, then use the clear and proper channel.   Of course you could try to warn the guy (although this may not be easy for everyone), but I don't think you're failing your responsibility if you don't.   &gt;**div**ersity causes **div**ision  These are mostly temporary (although my definition of temporary is in a historical-time-frame-sense TM, not a regular sense) knee-jerk reactions of people that rise spontaneously during contact with ""the others"", but then begin decreasing consistently as contact is prolonged and exposure more frequent.    In essence, there will be small friction (people disagreeing and maybe having arguments) that are fine. Arguing is a part of life, it's just an intense form of somewhat competitive communication, and when handled well, actually forms bonds. It's a skill like any other. You don't just need to win (sometimes you're wrong and *should* lose), you need to forge unity after the fight.   However, major friction (crimes) would be punishable. This means that over time people who don't like living with each other will not generate as much friction, as they have to work together, or at least inhabit the same space.   As I said, studies have shown that over time people become desensitized to other minorities if they inhabit the same space and see that the other minority doesn't commit crimes any more than they do. If a crime is commited, then their trust is repaired by the fact that a punishment will be dealt, and crime is heavily disincentivized.   This means that generation one becomes less race-biased, generation two even less so, so on. In addition, racemixing will happen over the next two centuries, and the lines between races will blur. This will make it difficult for racists to organize and otherize groups. Racists don't have to racemix or agree with this, as you said, they're a small enough minority that they won't have power to affect this. Once they don't have a method of turning your average guy racist (as they can't draw a clear line), their potential powerbase is gone. All of this is achieved by creating heavy disincentives against crime.   I can elaborate if need be, I get that my answer may not be the best at this point but I don't know what exactly is it that you're looking for here."

In cities, public fire services work best because you don't want people waisting time trying to figure out who's job it is to put out this fire.  You also don't want to let fires spread, because someone chose not to pay for the services.  But this only makes sense in big cities with tight layouts.  Rural communities don't benefit from public fire services, because of how spread out everyone is.  I can explain why public healthcare is bad.  If healthcare or health insurance is funded by taxes, not by the individual, then there is no financial incentive to take care of ones self.  I started taking better care of my teeth after I got my first dental bill.  But I'm not clear why public care is good."

So state control of the means of production is socialism. Meaning bureaucrats have a lot to do with socialism. Especially since every example of socialism which has achieved any reasonable success (China, USSR, Nazi Germany) has had a very oppressive government at the reigns, guiding society.  &gt;States are hierarchical. They are unnecessary.   Life is hierarchical. The problem is when the hierarchy is unjustified like that of the state. Unfortunately, when your ideology involves the redistribution of people's earnings and restrictions on property rights, the state becomes very necessary.  &gt;The fact that capitalists like from the US go into these countries, puts these workers in deplorable, unsafe working conditions  Generally safer than starving or doing backbreaking sustenance farming. And they have nowhere to go from their conditions but up, once they have capitalist systems gradually increasing prosperity.  &gt;undercompensates them,  In your opinion.  &gt;destroys the local environment  I'm pretty sure burning coal is better for the environment than deforesting the region for firewood; and as technology progresses, these energy sources become cleaner."

You make no such justification on why:  * A perpetual payment for the right to use a property is bad. Renting is actually a great bargain if the rent is low compare to the sale price.

Rent is only possible if there is a conspiracy by an owning class to exploit workers. Again, you assume rent is justified if it’s agreed to.

Capitalists are actually disincentivized in the long term to create full automation because there would be no costumers to sell their products to because no one has jobs. It's kinda like cocaine, it's good in the moment but it would fuck you up later.

The best case scenario is that people take very drastic actions to turn the world around, this would require continuous insurrection and no consessions to capitalists. Basically, communism is a negation that cannot be realized."

MariusIsMe,2020-01-20 20:12:21,ff3xpxi,t3_ep3eyg,t1_ff3wgie,Which video are you talking about. Why do you think it's propaganda? Is it because it's not real capitalism? If so then the deaths caused by Stalin is also not real communism and both ideologies have still caused the same amout of harm to the world.

I agree that people are equally important to me, I do wan't to empathize with them, I acknowledge that not everyone has empathy, but then you do a full 180 and say that you will force everyone to be empathetic. Aren't the unemphatic people equally important as the empathetic people?  I don't understand why the left thinks that *everyone* must be empathetic and why you want to hurt the ones who aren't. The way I see it, there will be empathetic people, so if someone needs help, there will be someone to help him. That's good enough, if the people who need help can get help, then we don't need to jail the people who don't feel like offering help.  &gt;so we aren’t at the mercy of those unwilling or unable to show it.  That's a bit dramatic. Unless your guts are escaping through a hole in your stomach, I don't really see how you are at someones mercy. I have personal issues with accepting help and I'm doing rather fine, it's better to receive help every now and then but it's not impossible to do things alone."

dog_snack,2020-01-21 21:42:29,ff781x9,t3_ep64gy,t1_ff5pxnk,"It’s not about forcing people to be empathetic—empathy is a feeling and you can’t force someone to feel—it’s about protecting people against unempathetic forces.   The left fought for worker protections, labour laws and minimum wages because bosses couldn’t be trusted enough to treat workers fairly. (Do you like weekends and more 10-year-olds with both hands still? You’re welcome). We enact human rights laws to protect against those who would discriminate against you in the provision of goods/services/status or as motivation for a crime.   &gt;I don't understand why the left thinks that everyone must be empathetic and why you want to hurt the ones who aren't.  I don’t want to hurt them, I want to reduce (not eliminate, that’s impossible) their ability to inflict their lack of empathy on others. Psychopaths are very good at attaining power, so we shouldn’t have a system that effectively rewards or is neutral on psychopathic behaviour.   &gt;The way I see it, there will be empathetic people, so if someone needs help, there will be someone to help him.  Most people have empathy—this I believe—but we need more society-wide ways of expressing it. If private charity is enough, why are so many people homeless? Why do so many kids go to bed hungry? Why are so many people underpaid and underworked? Why are so many people unable to find jobs or housing simply because they’re a different kind of person? Et cetera et cetera. Instead of just trusting everyone, there should be a system that *substitutes* for empathy when someone encounters a deficit of it.   &gt;I have personal issues with accepting help  That’s very revealing, I think this might be the root of the issue here. I think asking for help is a very courageous thing and we should encourage it, both on an interpersonal *and* political/economic level.   Leftism is, essentially, about knocking down needless hierarchies. When we don’t protect vulnerable people with laws, we open the door to hierarchies being reinforced through inaction."

A system of market socialism could also devolve into capitalism if it doesn't quickly transition to a non-market economy just like the ussr got stuck in the state-bureaucratic collectivism stage.   I want a system of anti-market mutualism in which people freely create unions of egoists whenever they please (to do things like produce food, satisfy passions, etc) and then abolish them when they are of no use. A worker's coop is a permanent insitution which gets sort of an identity of its own and the balance between the individual and the organization is unevenly titled in favour of the organization. We should also create temporary institutions where everyone comes up with creative ideas and then all the ideas contribute to the revolutionary platform in order to elaborately express the self-activity of our expanded egoisms, the problem with a corporation isn't the boss but rather the firm itself."

So while I get it's frustrating, it's kind of just something that is gonna happen when you aren't a capitalist or socialist and niche down pretty far. Most people can't even define capitalism or socialism let alone anarcho-syndicalism, so you have to kind of bear with them.  It's like saying ""I'm a choice first pescatarian organic eastern northern who eats some hooved animals"" to a waiter and expecting them to understand your viewpoints immediately. Sorry lucy, you've got some 'splanin to do.  Or more aptly these days if you say you're like a non binary zizzryx and expect a random person to know your pronouns. It's like 'dude, it's kinda on you when you are something nobody has heard of'.
