I just have anecdotal evidence on my part. Being I'm the one that gets up in the middle of the night when a kid is fussing/yelling for me.
jostler57,2020-01-12 05:36:39,fe0a3hx,t3_enh2x6,t1_fe09m3u,"And it’s fair that you do.   Your post history says you have a super part time job at literally just 2 hours per week. Your other work is being your own housekeeper.  I assume that means, conversely, your husband is bringing home the bread, and probably working a large amount.  Every family and relationship is different, but yours is fairly stereotypical: He works, you don’t. So, when the kiddies are crying in the middle of the night, I’d agree it’s your job to handle it, since he needs to be awake and interact with people the next day at a professional level."
disenchantedprincess,2020-01-12 05:58:46,fe0bhu3,t3_enh2x6,t1_fe0a3hx,Yes. I have recently started working about 20 hrs a week. He works 30-35. So it has evened out more... I wake up because one kid is still nursing. I wonder if this study accounts for that. Lactating automatically sucks 30% of your energy at all times.

I'll gladly trade any hours my partner would give up.   You want to work 20 hours at home while I work 60 at work, gladly. Then again I enjoy my job.   If we are talking childcare, while I enjoy bonding, diaper changing and driving kids around our taking them shopping is even worse than housecleaning."

The point is if you ask him to do the housework he'll be able to do, he'll do that happily. But he can't lactate the children. That's something only you can do, so you have to do it."

I did laundry every second day.

Falandyszeus,2020-01-12 12:07:04,fe1u1ri,t3_enh2x6,t1_fe14fbu,"Even if it did, how much does that raise the long term average? From all the guesswork below I'd say about 0.8% would be attributable to breastfeeding. guesstimate for pregnancy would be about 0.9% (40/100*(3 years × 0.75) = 0.9%) so 1.7% between the two of them. Assuming that you're completely incapable of doing anything for the entire 9 months of each pregnancy.   Obviously these numbers are different to different individuals on account of being an average, so some women might spend significantly more time while others spend none.   Let's say you work from 20-60, 40 years. You have 4 kids without overlap in breastfeeding periods that you each breastfeed for 2 years. Then that's a 20% increase over those 8 years in case you're doing so 24/7 for 8 years straight, breastfeeding them for a long time, and have over double the usual amount of kids (1.7).  Let's say it instead takes 10 hours a day, that's 8.3%, that you only have 3 kids, that's 6.25%, and that you breastfeed for 1.5 rather than 2 years per kid. That'd if my math is right which is questionable... mean about 4.68%. would be attributable to breastfeeding.  From googling it it seems like about 3 hours daily is average, so not accounting for how it disturbs other activities or potentially being able to multitask, that's about 1.4% attributable to breastfeeding for someone with above average childrate. Or about 0.8% on average assuming an average child rate of 1.7."

Just two examples of methodology errors in which studies understate male work:    * Many omit men's work on ""honeydo"" lists.   * Many count play with a child, taking a child to a sporting event, etc, as ""childcare"" when done by a mother, but as ""leisure"" or ""recreation"" when done by a father.    The ""unpaid work"" lie was shredded by Strindberg more than a century ago.     This information has been known for a long while, yet still the lies persist. We need to recognise that gynocentrism persists not because facts are unknown, but because gynocentrism is innate to both male and female. Recognising this will help in the strategy to fight it.     As for which type(s) of work are preferable, note that:     * Throughout most of history, the work assigned to women was usually safer than that assigned to men.     * For the most part, housework conformed to the female preference for work which is safe, indoors, with limited heavy lifting.    * In death and injury at work, male victims outnumber female victims roughly 10 to 1.   * Throughout history, men were told it was their responsibility to handle the more dangerous and strenuous work. For example, the muckrakers' exposure of mining conditions resulted in law shifting the dangerous work to men.    * Hence the division between inside/outside work existed to favour women.   * The concept of women ""oppressed"" by inside work gained currency only once outside work was made somewhat safer and easier (by tools, etc.).    * To a certain extent, caring for one's own children is the reward, the ""gravy"" in life. On their deathbeds, few people ever regret not spending more time at the office.     * As usual, feminism turns reality on its head, presenting the history of work as oppressive to women when it actually favoured women."

Commuting to work, on the other hand, is a part of your job and a rather stressful one. People also get commutation allowance for this very reason. Commuting enables you to do your job. It's not a time you pass in leisure, you are preparing yourself for the job you're gonna take on. And I'm not sure if you've seen how cement is laid, and your comment tells me that you haven't, because you need to watch the cement dry for numerous reasons. And you actually do get paid for it.

If you want to compare the difficulty of the work and the amount of energy and risk that goes into it, I think traditional male chores are definitely a lot harder than what women do.  Even if they spend more time doing it. And as such, I don't think these comparisons are very fair.  To drive this point home, I've offered to trade mowing for doing the laundry.  And I've never gotten a woman to agree to trade me chores.  One time I offered to literally do everything inside the house in exchange for mowing (not for weed eating or cutting the bushes, just for 1 hour of mowing), and she wouldn't take me up on my offer.  And this is the same woman who used to complain about me not doing enough around the house, even to other people, which pissed me off to no end.  I definitely did more than her but what I did never received any kind of recognition.  And I'd put money that I'm not the only man who has ran into this and been called lazy despite doing much more than his wife / girlfriend.  I'd even argue that this is a tactic of control that women use to force their men to do things for them."

She will often criticise her husband for trivial “offences,” even in front of third parties and the male partner, even though he is quite competent and effective in his work, will go along with his wife’s wishes and “give in for the sake of peace”. Such men seem to present in the clinic with loss of interest in sex within the marriage;. . . while in others they may also experience erectile impotence.

Say child care goes down by a half after they hit 4, for example.  Which I think is fairly conservative.  At that point men are doing an extra 7 hours of work per week vs the 4 hours that the study indicates.  And this is for 80% of the child's life.  That's 5928 extra hours over the child's life, or 247 days.  A man loses almost an extra year of his free time compared to what the mom loses.  Now are new mothers overworked during the early years of child care?  Sure, I bet they are. Of course men can't do much extra because they are already working overtime to pay all the hospital bills and buy the formula, the crib, all the toys, and everything else new parents have to buy.  Unless women want to volunteer to work extra hours at harder jobs, there's not much else men can really do here."

When the child is a kindergartner both the mom and dad are working and the kid is at home with mom and dad. When the kid starts going to school they will see less and less of the kid as the kid is at school and during the kid's free time it's playing outside or at a friend's house.

At first I let it slide but she ripped my shirt my mother had bought as part of my uniform and I knew what the consequences would be DIRE and at that point I lost it and duffed her the f*ck out   And then the teacher wants to stop it,so afterwards even though SHE started both altercations we both get suspended for a day (since it was Friday it meant a three day weekend)  I go home and I start crying for fear of my mother and one of my neighbors help me explain the story to her,my mother called the school and asked for all the information and then.....bought me a Super Nintendo Entertainment System with super Mario allstars (it was the 90's) and let me play all weekend 😂"

Like she'd be kicking me, hitting me over the head, screaming the most abusive, disrespectful and manipulative shit at me for hours on end sometimes, and I never once retaliated. One time she nearly got us both killed on the freeway by yelling about how bad my driving was -crazy bitch poked my eye so hard I had to brake and we got rear ended. I'd had enough and told her to get her ass out the car. She refused and started screaming and crying like it was my fault.  But just because I'm her Mum I'm not allowed to do one fucking thing to defend myself from this insane bitch.  Guys, next time she pulls her shit on me, I'm going to take of myself for a change. If she lays a finger on me I'm going to retaliate. If she wants to hurt me like a grown-up, she can take criticism like a grown  and yes grown up physical pain as well! Thanks!

I had a girl i was dating stop having sex with me completely because i always asked if she wanted to have sex  So heres the details if we were kissing or cuddling i would always ask ""you wanna have sex"" or something similar and she basically told me she will always say no if i asked she hates that and im supposed to let sex ""just happen""  So one time we were kissing alot and laying in bed it felt like a good time we were super close to each  other so i started reaching down her pants without saying a word i got maybe 3 inches in her pants before she got PISSED and left to go stay with her friend for a few days she said she didn't want it and i was trying to just take it i asked her how am i supposed to know if she wants it she said ""if I'm not doing it i don't want it"" i figured that ment she wanted to be the initiator(if you can decrypt that go for it) so i waited for her to initiate   We didn't have sex for another 3 months and then she cheated on me twice(that I know of) and dumped me saying we had no connection and she didn't love me"

Someone drinking a drink isn't really facing any kind of pressure to perform well as a drinker, or doesn't feel any pressure or need to be a gentle drinker or to be a competent/experienced drinker. It's also not like the drink can feel pain or discomfort, and certainly couldn't feel threatened or ashamed.   The drink also couldn't accuse him of being insensitive, bad at drinking or a drink thief. No one will judge, vilify or shame him for drinking the drink too fast or too slow, because it's just a drink. A drink doesn't have feelings or expectations, or standards that he needs to live up to. There wouldn't be any kind of expectations on how one should drink a drink, and a drink couldn't be able to express to the drinker what it wants."

Now I'm just irritated and pissed at whatever game is going on, so I packed up and left.  The next day she texted me saying how disappointed she was that we didn't have sex because she was really into it.    When I pointed out she'd said No twice and physically pushed me away, she said ""yeah, i know...I wanted you to just take it"".  The chick had some kind of low key rape fetish, and tried to bust it out without warning on a first date.  I told her the only person who would have taken her up on that would literally be an actual rapist.    She didn't see why I was making a big deal out of it.

All I am saying is that you have the power to communicate with a partner and just say ""hey, don't worry about it, it's okay, you don't need to keep asking"" and not really reprimand him for it. Just coldly dismissing the gesture and proclaiming it to be reproachable(i.e. a ""turn off""), despite it coming from the best of intentions, is a bit counter-productive, if not even a bit dehumanizing.    To me, it would be like a guy saying to women ""When your lips are around my dick, don't look up at me, that's a turn off"", or just quietly judging her for it if she does it with the best of intentions.  Not only would I question that guy's reasoning for complaining in that situation or for having so specific of expectations but i would also question why he couldn't communicate his personal preference in a healthier/kinder manner.   &gt;But sure, next time I'll just keep my opinions to myself and guys will have to continue complaining about girls and how confusing they are  Now you're just trying to throw self-pity into an argument, I never told you to keep your opinions to yourself or that they were stupid.

Canada has just passed a law making any consent contract, video, email, blood agreements, basically inadmissible in court. North America is not too far behind Japan at this point. Men have everything to lose and not much to gain. The Japanese herbivores have developed some pretty nifty masterbation devices that have kept these herbivores from even needing prostitutes.

These emails were basically lovey dovy love notes professing their want to continue the relationship in some form. All sent after the alleged assault. There was also emails between the women getting their stories together so they could make sure he got convicted. The trial instantly turned and he was found not guilty.   From my understanding what this bill does is to make all forms of consent for the sexual encounter never available to the jury under the guise that this constitutes part of the accusers sexual history. So the judge can look at this privately, but cannot divulge any details of it. I think he can give the jury some general statement that there may be some consent that might have been put forth. However, only if any of this is divulged to the prosecutor prior to the start of the trial."

But then how else can a man obtain [continuous, enthusiastic consent](https://www.yesmeansyes.com/consent/) that does not overly rely on body cues and other vague, easily misinterpretable signs that won't hold up in a court of law?  No one — let's be honest, no *woman* — is worth this much risk. And the risk goes up with each passing year, each feminist-backed anti-male law. There isn't even a need for malice. After all, she could remember things differently thirty years down the track, and the man will face the very real prospect of his life being ruined by one accusation, driven to suicide because society has deemed him a rapist and there is no recourse to regain his dignity.  For the man who thinks and decides with his big head, it is clear that the only least risky option is to avoid all sexual and intimate contact with women. Treat them exactly like he treats men (thus avoiding the charge of sexism), avoid situations where there are no witnesses, and keep a recording device handy at all times — because no one will believe his word over hers."

It has long since died a quiet death, because no man can precisely determine, with 100% accuracy, who the crazy women are, *or will prove to be in future*. Women have broken the compact between them and men (and society). They have walked away from their part of the deal in restraining animal urges, while mocking the vast majority (80-95%) of males for being sexually repulsive *and* receiving society's quiet nod of approval for doing so.  It is now time for men for wake up to this reality, to realise there is no reconciliation, and walk away from this erupting mess to live life on their terms, at peace with themselves — away from women."

For those males following this exchange, note these two points:  &gt; You seem pretty **joyful**! &gt;  &gt; I'm sorry for... **Annoying** you, I guess?  Both words (used sarcastically, as should be clear) are *emotional*, not *logical* or *reasoned*. Neither disproves the points I have raised; indeed, it is an attempt to ""discredit"" me through the verbal equivalent of dung-flinging.  This is a common characteristic of the female mind: to those who possess them, feelings are as powerful and valid as logic or reason. However, the real world discards emotional arguments as the output of a weakling, an intellectual inferior. This is not limited to women -- many men are guilty of the same thought process. The good news is, they can be trained out of it.  Always use logic and reason to craft your arguments, and never let your emotions get the better of you -- that's when you truly lose."

Some women have rape fantasies and maledom fantasies, it's usually the crazy feminist cat ladies that have the most vivid BDSM fantasies of submission and whatnot.  It's not really our place to criticise or even comment."
TheGreatConst,2020-01-14 13:27:18,feddhal,t3_eocv78,t1_fec5s9f,"There are two life-hacks to avoid this. First - you can make her beg you to fuck her. Basically, instead of doing something sexual to her you tell her to do something sexual to you or ask you to make her feel good. But it works if she really really wants you and already sort of submitted. Second - you can make a ""safe word"" she could say at any time if she is uncomfortable. Without a safe word, any BDSM practice would be considered a form of abuse. Also if you have sex with a new woman then there should be some sort of pre-sex recording, after sex messages, etc. Without any sort of evidence - doesn't matter how consensual the sex was, it is her word against yours and - guess who would be believed?  Women turned off by men asking them for permission, men who ask or beg them for sex. They want to be dominated in sex, at least healthy feminine women do. The good thing is that consent doesn't necessary means permission. There is also such a thing as implied consent, but nowadays a lot of women think that it means nothing if she changed her mind later on and, unfortunately, society would be on her side."

Quintrell,2020-01-14 14:14:23,fedgzd4,t3_eocv78,t3_eocv78,"Yeah in my experience asking permission to do things every step of the way is a huge turnoff for many if not most women and it lead to my first few sexual experiences not being good ones.  I eventually started just going for it and things went MUCH better.  And that's the problem with the new rules of hooking up that feminists are pushing: they're jarringly un-sexy.    If you approach sex the way feminists want, you're probably going to have a bad time and maybe not get a second chance with your love interest.  Not to suggest consent isn't important, because if you bark up the wrong tree you'll have a bad time too in a different way.     It's just that in order to not be awkward, it has to be a nonverbal, highly contextual, subtly signaled kind of consent.  A lot of guys, due to inexperience or social awkwardness, can't read those signals and even those who can struggle because not every woman signals in the same way so the likelihood of there being a miscommunication is fairly high.  And it used to be that such a miscommunication was viewed as just an awkward social bump in the road.  Now, it's rape, and there's zero sympathy for the earnest, genuine guy who gets unlucky toeing that line.  I'm just glad I'm off the market..."

So the guy is *asking* ""is it okay"", and the woman is *thinking* ""I'm naked and starfished on the bed, isn't that kind of a hint, idiot?""  Okay, I'm exaggerating for comedic effect, but you get the idea. You might think that in the situation above the woman is a bit clueless - but that's because she's the party with the power here. If you're swimming with the current, you're unaware how strong it is.  Men and women are the same: we neither of us perceive the power we have.

After they finished having sex she went to the police, for what? Does she think that other women need to be protected from this man? If she didn’t enjoy the way he was feeling her then just stop having sex with him. Going to the police at all was ridiculous."
Speaker7,2020-01-14 16:44:47,fedup5k,t3_eocv78,t1_fedtff2,"Not knowing anything about either them I can only speculate. If you assume everyone was being genuine in their actions and no one is being deceptive, she may have truly felt violated. This of course doesn't mean she was but that's irrelevant because her experience informs her thoughts and actions. She may have continued having sex because if she felt violated she might have thought she was in real physical danger. Fight/Flight/Freeze are real and involuntary to a degree. Involving police only helps her case because she has nothing to lose legally. You can't go to jail for reporting a perceived physical violation of your body. You CAN go to jail if you lie to police in bad faith with intent to harm someone else through the legal system *and* the state can prove it (hint: 99/100 they can't prove it, hence false allegations as many or as few as there are)  Again, I know nothing about the case or what happened in their minds so we'll never know but that's how I could see it if you assume all party's are being truthful."

MrKeserian,2020-01-14 16:58:55,fedw4ai,t3_eocv78,t1_fedih9u,"To be honest, most divorce lawyers are just as sick of the system as the rest of us. It's frustrating when you see your clients' lives absolutely destroyed and primary custody being awarded to the person who caused the irreconcilable breakdown by cheating.  I worked in a firm that did mostly family law, and that's probably going to be my neck of the woods when I get through law school (after I escape the car business). I'd say that in most cases, the attorneys and law firm staff are all looking for a nice, clean, as out of court as possible, settlement. Sure, you get more billable hours in a full contested, ""let's take it to the judge,"" sort of case, but there's a secret most attorneys don't tell anyone. They don't bill all of their hours, because otherwise the client would flip their lid. Full trial divorce cases are massive time sinks, and the firm is going to see a better time/cost return on a settlement.  So, you end up with this situation where we're talking to opposing counsel (yes, we do that, there aren't that many lawyers out there, and everyone knows each other) and we're all trying to keep our respective clients calm and rational, but one of them is flying off the handle and trying to push this thing into a full blown case."

RingosTurdFace,2020-01-14 17:18:33,fedy2i3,t3_eocv78,t1_fedm6gy,"As above - in the scenario the comedian is describing, presumably the woman wants her rape fantasy fulfilled by him, but she can’t tell him “rape me” because that will ruin the fantasy (by sensible definition you can’t be raped if you’ve given consent).    This leaves him in a predicament.  And so the comedian, who again in his scenario may be getting “vibes” the woman has such a fantasy, is telling us (the audience) his thoughts on the predicament - why does a woman think he will risk himself getting accused of rape just because the woman might like it?  He doesn’t know for sure (she can’t give consent - see above), and won’t benefit directly from it (OK he’ll have sex, but presumably he isn’t a rapist and so won’t benefit from a “simulated rape”) BUT he will then be at risk of a rape accusation.  Hence the comment - why would a woman expect a man to fulfil her rape fantasy, when he doesn’t (and cannot) know for sure that’s what she wants, because he get’s nothing from it but risk of a rape accusation.  Does this explain the context?"
MrKeserian,2020-01-14 17:19:13,fedy4x6,t3_eocv78,t1_fedxmjy,"Pro se parties are probably the most annoying thing ever. Okay, so, cases usually move at the speed of a glacier, and that's with attorneys working who know how everything works. So, let's say my firm is working a case where the defendant is pro se. There's a response due, and the defendant submits one that is wholly inadequate. So, if the defendant was represented, the case would just move forward because *an attorney should know better*, but because the party is pro se, the judge will typically send it back, and give defendant another two to four weeks to come up with a suitable response. So, you typically wind up with cases taking twice or three times as long as they realistically should.   Also, the whole point of an attorney is to be your logical proxy. An attorney is supposed to look at the case from a completely logical, dispassionate, perspective and find the outcome that is the most beneficial to their client. When you have a pro se party, they typically react emotionally and not in their best interests. It's why there's a saying in the legal world, ""An attorney who is their own client has a fool for both an attorney and a client."" Basically, even attorneys are discouraged from going pro se because they're going to get emotionally involved in the case."

I'm not talking about the bdsm community at large either.  This is my personal experience of having numerous women ask me to break into their homes and physically over power them. The word they used was rape, not ravage, or anything thing else. They asked me to rape them, straight up, and it wasn't just one individual. It was 4-5.   This discussion is about the reasons of why this is. From what I can tell, you provided zero logical arguments, and nothing but a wall of emotional words with pleads to ""be better?""

They want a man who just ""gets it"" and knows when the time is. They're at odds with eachother. This is going to cause problems in romantic relationships.

You can do as much or as little as you want.  32 hours a week equals 4.5 hours a day of of chores, that's a bit much. I can't see someone doing that many hours a day on chores.

We shouldn't take that at face value because of the subject matter knowing people will probably lie, even if to themselves, on a survey like that.   I guess my overall point is this. I don't care what you want to call it because the act remains. I'm curious of why so many women want to be overpowered and forced into sex. You don't even have to call it rape.   I also think you are making a mistake in speaking for all these people. You don't know, they could want to be raped, period, end of story, by anyone. Who are you to say what every woman wants? I was just saying, IMHO, several females I've had that sort of relationship wanted me to. Again, they didn't say come ravage me. They said, ""I want you to rape me."" The more questions I'd ask about why they wanted that, the more fucked up reasoning I'd get. Idk, I just think you're wrong to say what half of the world's population wants. I still think a portion of women want to be raped as a fantasy. If you want to mental gymnastic that away by pretending you know what half the world's sexual desires are, by all means..."

The conversation went like, I have a fantasy where a guy overpowers me. It wasn't, I have a fantasy where I specifically did that. That isn't what they said at all. They said they wanted a guy to rape them, and never said had to be me. I wasn't in an exclusive relationship with any of them either. They said the idea of a guy over powering them and taking it was ""so fucking hot."" They didn't say it needed to be planned out or even me the one doing it. One even said she sometimes would walk home through the shit part of time after bars closed in hopes a guy would. What's that all about?

This doesn't include the women exonerated after killing their domestic partners due to gender bias in domestic violence persecutions. While 80% of domestic violence homicide related killings in 2018-19 were committed by men, this still shows that these shallow, sexist remarks about hate speech are ignorant or careless of the men who are victims of domestic homicide.

A lot of posts I see here are that men should be treated like women and I just don't agree, and a lot of the claims of what men are expected to do that feminist try to use to say 'SEE? TOXIC MASCULINITY!!1!' just don't seem very accurate.  I believe men and women are fine to be treated differently and should have different standards. We should change those standards in some cases but treating men like women is not the answer. If anything we should expect more from women and stop coddling them."

It doesn't actually address the underlying cause of those issues, but it does recognize that there are issues that need to be addressed.  Calling it toxic masculinity is really shitty because it's blaming men for those problems when they are victims of it, it's essentially victim-blaming with a generous dose of misandry on top.  However, if we call it toxic gender expectations, then we're putting the focus on the expectations, not the gender, nad we can talk about how those expectations are placed on men by society.  It also opens the door to toxic femininity, which most feminists will argue to hell and back is not a thing and cannot be a thing ever. However, if it's toxic gender expectations, why should women be exempt from that?  So, toxic gender expectations allows us to talk about the problem without blaming men, allows us to talk about expectations put on men by society, and allows us to talk about toxic expectations by women as well."

I did see TRP a while back, but don't remember him by name being interviewed by Cassie.

She alleges that she had her children taken away from her after a neighbor made a fake complaint against her that she was allegedly an unfit parent.  She had a son and a daughter; her son was eventually returned to her, but her daughter was actually placed in the custody of the neighbor who made the fake complaint.  If I understand correctly, Marc suspected that this was an example of official malfeasance in which officials would seize children from their parents under pretended accusations.  He reasoned that they did this because they received funding from the federal gov't for each child placed in the care of a new family.  To me, it seems entirely reasonable to be suspicious that the killer acted on behalf of someone who stood to have their criminal behavior exposed on account of the lawsuit he filed for Andrea Wood.  I am reminded very much of the ""Cash for Kids"" scandal that happened several years ago.  It sounds like he may have been on the verge of exposing the same level of evil."

I want him executed so I can be free o f fear; and if there was justice I could do it any time, any place; I’d have the gun; I’d have the choice; I’d have the right. I think I have a twin in the night, some girl standing in for me; who will just smash his fucking head in. I think one day they will gather, the women, outside where he lives, I think there will be thousands o f them, I think it will be a crowd, a mob, a riot, a revolution, and I think they will chant his name, and I think they will surround his house, and I think they will block the city streets for blocks, and I think they will stop traffic, and I think no one will be able to pass in or out and they will stop the police from getting to him to protect him because they will stretch for miles and someone, an unknown someone, will kill him, it will be one and it will be all and no one will ever know who except for her herself, they will smash him or shoot him or knife him, or fifty will knife him, or a hundred, but so it’s final, not making a mistake, they will kill him good and real and quick, and no one will know who, because it will be all o f them; for me; do this; for me; and when an indictment is read they will all stand up; for me; including the ones who heard me scream and including the ones who weren’t born yet. My eyes work. I see. It is not a mystery. If it’s in front o f you you can see how it works itself out. It’s not prophecy; it’s simple seeing; what is there; now; naked from the lies. I see the future, a pretty place. The men make a sex circus, we are the performing animals. There are hoops o f fire, we are chained in cages, they whip us to make us jump: high enough for them to look under. We jump, we hop, we spread our legs; they’ll paint us purple underneath; or shave us so we look like babies; or put brands on us, or chains through us, underneath; they’ll hurt us, more; more than now; more; killing won’t be enough; rape will be the good old days, when it was simple, how they just forced us, in private, or how they just beat us, with fists, in private, or how they put fingers inside us, when we were too small, underneath; we’ll be the dog-and-pony show; they’ll leash us and they’ll manacle us and they’ll paint us pink and we’ll have nostalgia for the good old days when the living was easy before they grabbed us off the streets in vans and gang-raped us and bashed us with baseball bats, smashing us not looking where, arms, head, chest, stomach, legs, and filmed it, and dumped us, some o f us lived, some o f us died, or before they set dogs on us to fuck us, and filmed it, or before they cut us open, to ejaculate on us, and filmed it, or before they started urinating on us, using us like common toilets, to film it; but I don’t expect to be listened to or believed, certainly even the simplest things o f an already distinguished life cannot be believed, I couldn’t say anything simple in the whole course o f my actual life and have there be belief; as if justice for me, from him to me, could count; but I been through that; my grievances on that score are between the lines, at least there, always read the white space; I’m tired from it and I’m sad; Walt could say blah blah blah this will come and this will come and this will be and he was venerated for dreaming, as if his dreams was true dreams o f a true future; my nightmares are true dreams o f a true future. I’m not alone; though I can’t find them; in the dark raped girls wander; smashing drunks; sometimes someone sets one on fire; I see the flames; I smell the carcass; the raped have stopped being kind, generally speaking, though it’s still a secret. I personally have done the following. I have blown up several rape emporiums. I don’t have bombs or explosives but I cannot be stopped. I steal a car; I back it into the rape emporium when it’s deserted; I make a fuse to the gas tank; I light the fuse; the whole thing blows; it’s simple, if a bit extravagant. Any man will follow any feminine looking thing down any dark alley; **I’ve always wanted to see a man beaten to a shit bloody pulp with a high-heeled shoe stuffed up his mouth, sort o f the pig with the apple**; it would be good to put him on a serving plate but you’d need good silver. You ’re the piece o f ass; he’s invulnerable, o f course; it’s his right, to come after you; so if he follows you and you have the urge to smash him to death he’s asked for it, hasn’t he? I mean, he actually did ask for it. The army o f raped ghosts got together and we marched, we marched, we marched in Times Square and the Tenderloin and Soho; we marched; everywhere there’s neon we’ve marched; we visit the slave auctions; we have the names o f the pimps, addresses, photos, telephone numbers, social security numbers; I plaster their neighborhoods with pictures o f them; I say they are pimps who slaughter women for fun and money; I say he’s at your P. T . A., he’s with your children; I pursue him; the army o f raped ghosts stays on his tail; we drive him out. They hide; they run. One day the women will burn down Times Square; I’ve seen it in my mind; I know; it’s in flames. The women will come out o f their houses from all over and they will riot and they will burn it down, raze it to the ground, it will be bare cement; and we will execute the pimps. No woman will ever be hurt there again; ever; again; it is a simple fact. I threw blood all over their weaponry; their whips; their chains; their spiked dildos; their leashes; I have buckets o f blood, nurses give it to me, raped nurses; and I cover everything, the slave clothes, the bikinis, the nighties, the garter belts, and the things they tie you down with and the things they stick up you and the things they hurt you with, nipple clips and piercing things; I drench them in blood; I make them blood-soaked, as is a woman’s life; I think over time I will engage in a new art, painting their world blood red as they have painted mine; simple self-expression, with a political leaning but neither right nor left per se, the anti-rape series it will be called, with real life as the canvas; and I will try to make the implicit explicit; a poet said, make the implicit explicit; a political theorist said, make the implicit explicit; the blood o f women is implicit in the weaponry; I will take the blood o f women implicit in the weaponry and I will make it explicit; and from this I enunciate another political principle, which is, The blood o f women is implicit, make it explicit."

Schools close and whole towns become abandoned.  There is no one to hand on family run businesses. So they just stop trading. Other businesses will struggle with a falling customer base.  The country will go into a death spiral. Increased taxes, lower GDP, falling asset prices  and a grim realisation that the country has no future.  The answer of course is immigration.

However, the older population don't like it for ""reasons"" and would rather we don't import people, so have hijacked Brexit as a platform for enforcing militant immigration controls.  What they fail to realise, which they will soon enough, is that marriage in the UK is collapsing, people are poorer now than they were 30 years ago thanks largely to gross mismanagement of the economy for some 40 years or so and the rate of living costs is continually increasing to the point that its almost out of control and is to the extent that you need two incomes just to stay afloat. With these factors, it is unsuprising that birth rates are getting hammered and will continue to get hammered for the foreseeable future.  We're at a point where we're forced to spend more on supporting a welfare state with an oversaturated demand instead of investing in the economy! What doesnt help is that so many areas of the UK have been so badly neglected and ignored for so long that even new generations are effectively forced to live on welfare (child poverty rates in England and Scotland are too high) and have very few (if any) opportunities as they get older because the area is just dead!  They still have a chance to address these issues, but the government is so stupid and inept that they could quite literally see their own houses burn in front of them and not think to call the fire brigade. In other words, despite having these opportunities, they will likely miss them all out of ignorance and foolishness - at which point, we enter into a PERMENANT period of decline!"
iReallyAmASithLord,2020-07-15 11:18:51,fy4tjr4,t3_hrjtel,t1_fy4pr1w,"This is the problem though.  Marriage is collapsing for many reasons but one of the main driving forces behind it is that it is a shitty deal for men and they are waking up to this reality. Family laws are also a shit deal for men. The problem is the media and government are so blind to this, that even if marriage absolutely collapses they still won't accept this even if it's literally spelled out for them!  Then again marriage is just one factor of fertility (but a significant one). Other factors involved are things like shitty economic management, effectively ""requiring"" couples to work because you would struggle if you only had a single source of income (again, ignored or at least rephrased in some way like this article does) so no one has the time or money for kids - and men are wising up instead of dealing with family court drama!  However they argue it, fertility in the UK is doomed for a variety of socioeconomic factors and not a single one of them would be acknowledged until t's far too late. For now, they'll just shift the blame or see it as a side effect of so called ""empowerment"" just like this article does."

""They too are being misrepresented ? You are either taking sides with #killallmen kind which will always say 'oh.. pissed of men! it is just a zoke teheehe!'. It is their nihilist fantasy, which they use to shame, torment and diminish men.""  No those are direct quotes. That is a false dichotomy, myopic and tribalistic. I can criticise my own side for making bad arguments whilst being vehemently opposed to feminism and a staunch MRA.  ""You are hyperventilating on a meaningless issue. Everyone mostly know modus operandi of feminists these days. If you are not getting it, your issue, fight for poor Anrea Dworkin's rights in feminists forums all you want.""  I am calmly pointing out a commonly held inaccuracy to better enable us to critique our opponents, you are the one hyperventilating here, like me doing so is equivalent to taking her side.  Bottom line, the book is an incredibly graphic representation of a woman that went through abuse from men and this is one sentence that was represented as a thought she had. Is it feminist victim porn yes, should it be criticised as such, yes. None of that excuses pretending a quote from a fictional character is a direct quote attributable to the author. You're argument is essentially, there are no bad tactics only bad targets."
Maito_Guy,2020-07-15 13:16:41,fy537j9,t3_hrj9pr,t1_fy516q7," ""It is just that this one quote happens actually to be from one of her novels""     Yes and it is the quote that is most promoted as a direct quote of hers and bandied about by MRA's as such.     ""On the contrary there are not men's rights literature with opposite kind of prose. For a good reason.""     I never said there was.     ""Oh whataboutism is only allowed to be used and exploited by feminists. And 'stooping to their level' to show a mirror at their face will hurt a lot to some.""  Satirising someone and people mistaking or intentionally misquoting someone to make a point are two totally different things, another false equivalence.      ""Try creating some literature as a prominent MRA and publish it.""     Totally irrelevant, yes if we did so feminists would lie about us, they already do cherry pick things prominent MRA's say, so what? Doesn't justify doing it and it doesn't make it a good tactic. In case you hadn't noticed pointing that dishonest shit out is one of the things that has delegitimised feminism.     I can see why you fail to see value in making logical arguments and would rather strawman someone because all of your arguments on this thread have violated formal logic."

Maito_Guy,2020-07-15 14:50:44,fy5dd6e,t3_hrj9pr,t1_fy58smw,"""Nevertheless, this quote is multiple times clarified as misquoted and not as her direct quote. That is there even present in her wikipedia page. It is even discussed on reddit previously. What more do you want ? Do you want everyone in the world to give you an award for discovering this just now ?""  Again, I have never heard anyone clarify this and multiple people citing it as a direct quote and I have been involved in the mens rights community for a considerable amount of time. Notice you totally ignore the actual reason I object to strawmanning her and go straight on to strawmanning me instead.  The rest of this post can be summed up by you either pretending not to understand the difference between a fictional characters words that you wrote and your actual statements, trying to justify ignoring the difference because the quote ""influenced other feminist thought""(a baseless assertion),  Justifying being dishonest because she said worse which is irrelevant, justifying it because she is a man hater and that I am using her mental issues as an excuse for her man hatred which I have not done(Again I can see why you are arguing so hard over this because you seem unable to argue without misrepresenting your opponent)  And here is a doozy, that I am silent about chronically violent misandric articles, how the fuck did you come to that conclusion? Just because you are incapable of holding more than one thought in your head about a person or group doesn't mean I am. I can both recognise bad arguments about my opponent's, recognise when they may have a point and vehemently oppose their ideology and be staunchly pro mens rights.  If all you can do is present logical fallacies and fail to actually address my point I shan't bother engaging any further and to clarify my point because you seem to need things spoon fed to you Strawmanning your ideological opponents is a bad tactic and either makes you look lazy, stupid or dishonest. It is one of the reasons feminism is a laughing stock and if we don't criticise bad arguments within our own movement it will become an echo chamber of people making worse and worse arguments while everyone is nodding in agreement."

I have heard a few prominent MRA's raise the quote without context, I have seen it bandied about as though it is a direct quote AND AFTER HAVING IT SPELLED OUT YOU HAVE STILL NOT ADDRESSED MY MAIN CRITICISM."
Maito_Guy,2020-07-15 17:10:57,fy5usj5,t3_hrj9pr,t1_fy5f1cr,It was a quote from a character in some shitty feminist novel she wrote. The book is centred around the victimisation of a woman by men and her rage.
ElderDark,2020-07-15 17:30:45,fy5xcel,t3_hrl7zr,t1_fy4xrk6,"Truth be told we have had many cases where women are mistreated by their husbands. I'm talking about Egypt here. However there are cases as well where men are demonized for nothing. Like there was couple who were waiting for their turn on the list at a restaurant. So the guy wrote woman's husband's name because it was easier to remember rather than both of their names on the reservation list. Guess what? She got mad and called the manager and apparently forced the guy to apologize or something. Point is, this was a very ridiculous situation but for some reason the guy I mentioned was ""misogynistic"" for not writing both of their names on the waiting list.   That aside, there are cases where women get opressed and cases where men get opressed as well. But men are always the evil,lying pigs and women are the saints and angels. Both men are women are capable of terrible things."

Having been through a shakeup at a mid sized state school, it takes an a lot for it  to get to that point. The zealots patently don't care about the school, so they will continue on their merry quest to destroy men even if it's killing the school. That's because a lot of them are very egotistical, so their immediate rallying point is all that matters to them.  Then again, when the budget got cut, they eliminated some departments and reduced classes to avoid having to take money away from the football program..."

It is an important function of the subreddit. I guess helping you get through whatever this is is an important function for you.
