hitssquad,2019-11-29 16:25:46,f92xvoh,t3_e3gbxb,t3_e3gbxb,"&gt; Perhaps the most pressing question about bringing nuclear power to the battlefield is the obvious one: how can a reactor be protected from attack? Just as convoys in Iraq were targeted by insurgents, power supplies on tomorrow’s battlefields will likely come under fire too. Of course, a single small power plant is defensible in ways that hundreds of fuel trucks are not. Even so, the prospect of an attack that could spread nuclear materials and radiation is at the front of the mind, especially given the prominence of nuclear accidents in the media. The key to protection lies in designing the reactor for security from the start: with the fuel. These reactors will be fueled by tristructural isotropic particle fuel, where fissile uranium is fabricated inside small kernels encapsulated with carbon and ceramics. Testing indicates that threats to reactors designed for such fuels are minimized by this design as a breach would only affect small, subcritical kernels, not the whole critical mass. To test security, the contract solicitation requires contractors to provide a detailed plan to test for weapons attacks."

You need very expensive and time consuming equipment and expertise, and the reactor needs to be operated in a different way to sacrifice electricity generation beforehand, and that's way beyond the capabilities of mere terrorists.  Dirty bombs, aka conventional bombs laced with radioactive material, would kill more people with the conventional explosive itself (ie C4) than from the radioactive material. This is according to practically resource available from reliable sources, such as the NRC.  It seems that you have a grossly incorrect understanding of the dangers of radiation. Do not be alarmed. This a common problem because of the decades of misinformation from groups like Green Peace.

The lack of proper capital letters at the start of sentences, and the lack of proper punctuation, and the use of all caps for emphasis instead of bold or italics makes you look like a crank or a loon.  Second,   &gt; but it was you.. who said dirty bombs are no threat  I'd love to know where I said that. What I did say is this: ""the threat of dirty bombs are much exaggerated"".   &gt; because as you said... having one... and blowing it up... makes for a dirty bomb  The risk characteristics of a dirty bomb is very different from the risk characteristics of blowing up nuclear power reactor with a (non-nuclear) bomb.   ""Dirty bomb"" is a term with a very specific meaning in this context. It refers to a conventional bomb (i.e. C4) that has radioactive material added in some fashion so that when the conventional bomb goes off, it spreads radioactive material over a very short distance. The real harm here will be the hysteria and massive overreaction from the public because of the preexisting irrational fear over radiation. Except for public overreaction based on the public's irrational fear of radiation, dirty bombs are barely more dangerous than conventional bombs. More people would die from the (non-nuclear) explosion than would die from the radiation. Hell, more people might die from the toxic metal poisoning than would die from the radiation.  Blowing up a nuclear reactor core? That sounds fun. I'm not sure what would happen. It would depend a lot on a lot of specifics about the reactor design, and exactly what the bomb did. You might get something like Chernobyl or Fukushima. Still, only a few hundred died at worst from radiation from Chernobyl, and basically zero people died from radiation from Fukushima. Still, it would be something to be avoided, and it could be bad."

yes_nuclear_power,2019-12-22 16:45:28,fbqmans,t3_edvxjr,t1_fbpfd5q,"It is funny how supporters of solar and wind used to argue that, even though these technologies were originally far more expensive than the alternatives, given time, the industry would be able to lower costs.  It turns out that this is a sound argument because over time the supply chain became more robust and the people became more efficient.  However, when it comes to nuclear power, the same people who assured us that costs for solar and wind would drop, suddenly stop believing that the same market forces apply to nuclear power. Crazy."
yes_nuclear_power,2019-12-22 17:07:06,fbqqpkp,t3_edvxjr,t1_fbqnyfu,"Nuclear costs followed the exact curve expected.  They were dropping until demand slowed and then once the supply chain weakened and people in the industry started retiring the price to restart the industry went back up.  The same thing would happen to solar and wind if we were to shutter the industry for a few decades.  If the solar panel factories were shut down, it would be expensive to rebuild them and start again.  In countries where nuclear power is continuing to be developed, prices are continually dropping.  This was the case when France decarbonized their electricity sector in the 70's and is currently the case in Russia, China and South Korea.  You are right that innovation and rapid iteration is faster in the renewables sector.  I am happy that costs are dropping in that sector."
yes_nuclear_power,2019-12-22 17:20:01,fbqsmqu,t3_edvxjr,t1_fbqocqa,"I just read your link and he doesn't say solar uses rare earth metals. Maybe I missed it?  Can you point out where he says rare earth metals?  He is quoting The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) about the  ""250,000 metric tonnes of solar panel waste in the world at the end of that year. IRENA projected that this amount could reach 78 million metric tonnes by 2050.""  I would imagine that IRENA would be a good source of information. What source do you use to dispute it? Perhaps improvements can be made as you are claiming and that is a good thing. Your framing of Shellenberger as disingenuous isn't supported by your sources.  His sources seem credible and his position seems reasonable based on the article you linked to."
yes_nuclear_power,2019-12-22 18:23:52,fbr4g16,t3_edvxjr,t1_fbquvdq,"FYI rare earths are not rare. I think they are mentioned because their production produces toxic waste.  The mass does matter because if it contains toxic materials like cadmium and lead etc it must all be processed before disposal.  I have to agree with the point that the biggest problem with solar panel waste is that there is so much of it, and that's not going to change any time soon, for a basic physical reason: sunlight is dilute and diffuse and thus require large collectors to capture and convert the sun's rays into electricity.  The energy in wind is also diffuse and requires a lot of material to capture that energy.  These things being true however We should not spend our time making this a contest between our favourite energy sources. Each has its strengths and weaknesses. In some sunny locations, solar makes sense. In other windy locations, perhaps the answer is wind power. For other places nuclear or hydro are the answer."

The massive Amount of waste generated by solar panels is not due to rare earth elements, but because of the high purity needed: Silicon (or quartz) does not appear cleaner than other ores do. If you try to purify this to a level needed for semiconductors like solar cells you will will discard a mix of toxic heavy metals and other substances that make up about 20% of the ore.  Fun fact: The french silicon industry produced enough uranium and thorium in their waste that it would suffice to power France for a century."

What ""certain peoples"" does it ""empower and enrich""?  Far as I can tell, climate change and the work to address it is going to cost _all_ of us a bunch.  How does nuclear power threaten this ""machine""?  That doesn't even make sense; nuclear power would be one of the potential beneficiaries, since it's a carbon-free source.  Put the stupid-think away, man.  The science on the matter is clear.  The science on the solution is also clear (though our politicians are too afraid of public backlash to say _that_ too loud, due to nuclear fear pushed by fossil fuel companies and their ""environmentalist"" proxies).  I'll say it again, the science on the matter is clear: CO2 absorbs and re-emits heat at a higher rate than nitrogen; increasing the percentage of CO2, as a result, raises the planet's thermal equilibrium.  It really is that simple to get your head around if you're not trying to make hard weather predictions - and it _necessarily_ means that climate change is a real thing.  All the albedo and forcing and stuff (where there's actual scientific debate) narrow down the predictions of warming rates - but it's absolutely true that increases in atmospheric CO2 necessarily lead to a higher thermal equilibrium for the earth.  This is not some plot.  It's not a lie.  It's not some massive, international conspiracy with millions of scientists ""in"" on it - and to be clear, the idea that it might be is patently, _shamefully_ absurd.  The fact is, there _is_ a conspiracy here, but it's not one to _promote_ climate change.

Also, when was the last time Al fucking Gore was relevant to anything?  &gt; millions of scientists?  Counting the entirety of those working on climate and the horde of well-educated scientists in other fields that nonetheless are convinced of climate change?  Yes.  Millions.  I've seen the ""hundreds of scientists deny climate change"" letters.  Diving into those are fun: usually mathematicians and the occasional disgraced physicist, followed by a horde of chiropractors and other assorted pseudoscientists.  There is no debate in science - _none_ - about whether climate change is a real thing.  There's some debate about extents and effects - and that's _it_.

I do _not_ expect the earth to be a comfy place to live by the time I'm dead.  Climate change is _absolutely_ happening, and we are _absolutely_ doing almost nothing to fix it.  Because, incidentally, we're satiating our greed, as a species, on carbon.  And those extracting the carbon are happily sowing discord to ensure that remains the case.  I've bitched about this before: we'll do nothing, because one side denies the problem, and the other denies the solution.

Environmentalism of the 70's and 80's were fueled by anti-nuclear propaganda and dishonest conflation between weapons and energy, to protect fossil fuels.  Back then - without the benefit of the internet - such lies tended to stick.  Hell, the environmentalism groups probably didn't know they were repeating lies.  Nuclear energy is a reasonably complex topic and, at the time, it was _much_ harder to fact check.  They have less pull with modern environmentalists, and modern environmentalism has _far_ less excuse for that sort of ignorance - but Bernie is very old-left in a lot of ways.

kyletsenior,2020-05-13 09:39:46,fqgzp6n,t3_giub5x,t3_giub5x,"MSRs offer a number of impressive advantages over LWRs.   The issue though is the cost and time to develop a new and very radical reactor technology. There are a number of what I'm sure are solvable issues with MSRs, but the current political and bureaucratic climate in almost every nuclear nation is that all of these problems should be solved in lab experiments before any reactor is built. This means years and years of additional development time to test the materials and techniques needed.  My preferred method is to let companies build untested reactors with simple and rapid regulation with additional containment features far beyond what would be expected in commercial use, at already contaminated nuclear sites, with the company doing the testing being required to put up collateral for cleanup (the amount would not need to be the full amount, rather if the expected dismantlement date is 50 years from now, they could put up enough in an index fund so that when it comes to time to dismantle the reactor, the amount has grown).  This is pretty much what they did in the heyday of nuclear, except it was at greenfield sites and the government footed the bill. It's how the three original MSRs were built, and is still used today by the DoE for non-commercial reactors like naval reactors and space reactors (Kilopower for example was tested at the Nevada test site only a few years ago). The DoE is not bound by the NRC and can do it's own thing. Funny that despite the looser regulation they've never had a nuclear power accident that has killed a member of the public and not killed anyone since the 1960s.  Anyway, because of that I don't think an MSR is going to be built unless someone with very big pockets can throw $5b or so at it."

They already have had site discussion talks with both the US and Canada.  ThorCon is also playing in that market.

Hologram0110,2020-05-13 12:19:11,fqha7pr,t3_giub5x,t1_fqh6n09,"The challenge with the advanced reactor concepts it getting them out of the paper design stage. Finding someone to finance licensing and construction is a big challenge. All these investors want to de-risk each challenge along the way. Often that means years of material irradiations in test reactors. For some of the concepts supply chains don't exist for the quantity of the materials that they require (Haleu is an example but it applies to other materials like isotopically separated elements )  Then there is the challenge of regulating the reactors, but there is no experience or guide to follow, so you have to make up the regulations and apply them at nearly the same time. It is a big challenge."

whatisnuclear,2020-05-13 13:59:12,fqhjp47,t3_giub5x,t3_giub5x,"Some MSRs are breeder reactors, meaning that for an extra cost and complexity in fuel cycle you can have long-term sustainability for a huge fleet. A growing fleet of LWRs can only run on cheap fuel for a few hundred years.  MSRs put fission products all over the primary equipment, necessitating remote maintenance of it all, which is possible but very likely hard and expensive. LWRs keep the fission products in fuel pins and can do maintenance much easier.  MSRs operate at lower pressure and can offer robust decay heat removal in accidents, likely improving safety. On the other hand, LWRs are already safer than almost all other energy sources.  MSRs require technology development that may or may not lead to challenges we can't anticipate today. Proponents focus on potential pros but often brush over potential cons. LWRs are known today with all their pros and cons."
DV82XL,2020-05-13 14:37:03,fqhnjc1,t3_giub5x,t3_giub5x,"The real problem with MSR technology in competition with existing designs is the well-known economic-engineering principle that existing good enough trumps better.  The bald fact is that MSRs and thorium fuel cycles simply do not represent enough of an improvement over the existing power reactors out there that have racked up hundreds of thousand of hours of service, and are well understood. Nor do the seem to be far less expensive than solid fuel reactors.   To replace existing designs, it is going to need something an order of magnitude better, and MSRs, while an improvement (maybe) are nowhere near that good.   Yes there is work being done, but those projects will be successful in the market only if they are far more than marginal improvements over what is available now."

This isn't a fair fight, there is no grounds for some sort of balanced inquiry if one side hasn't the technical grounding or the ability to understand the numbers - we owe them nothing.

Any statement made by the opponent of the one that cries ‘shill’ must be invalid, because they’re in the pay of the imaginary demons (big whatever) who are trying to pull the wool over everyone’s eyes. How is this proven? Why by the fact that they oppose the one crying ‘shill’, of course.  I wonder sometimes if those that accuse others as being  shills even know why they’re reaching for this tautology as a conceptual shield? It may seem like a strong tactic to the person using it, because it feels useful to knock down any argument against them. But it’s merely a paradox – an unfalsifiable loop.  First because the accusation  invalidates anything the shill say, they can no longer defend themselves, because they could be lying about not being a shill. Why do they lie? Because they’re a shill.  Secondly the 'evidence' for the ones being shills is the fact that they have a stance against the one  accusing them. Calling someone a shill is the logical equivalent of saying, “You are wrong, because I am never wrong.“  We both know you are not capable of going through that report and arguing against its findings on the numbers, the only thing that is left for you is appealing to feelings or prejudices rather than intellect  - an **ad hominem** argument."

It’s been rolling up its sleeves for 6 decades now to provide constant, reliable, carbon-free power to millions of Americans.  Just how reliable has nuclear energy been?

PastaGoodGnocchiBad,2020-07-15 00:07:06,fy3cxjg,t3_hr4rvf,t3_hr4rvf,&gt; Natural gas and coal capacity factors are generally lower due to routine maintenance and/or refueling at these facilities.  I would have bet that output of coal/gas is lowered when wind/solar are producing since cost of fuel is higher than nuclear and cost of lowering output is lower. Am I mistaken?
DV82XL,2020-07-15 00:23:38,fy3eneu,t3_hr4rvf,t1_fy3cxjg,In reality it is more like the output of gas is higher when wind and solar are not producing  because  of policies to support renewables that confer priority to them in grid systems and also subsidies them.
Canaveral58,2020-07-15 01:13:07,fy3jr5z,t3_hr4rvf,t1_fy3aa5t,"Yeah and probably for the best. In my opinion, we should keep our major hydroelectric dams because of how much carbon free electricity they produce, but we shouldn’t really build any new ones because of their environmental impact. And if a dam is at the end of its life, and it isn’t producing electricity, then it should be torn down so that the river can return to its natural state."

Amur_Tiger,2020-07-15 04:30:18,fy42ser,t3_hr4rvf,t1_fy3eneu,Can't have a gas grid with green garnish without letting the Wind/Solar run.
iwriteaboutthings,2020-07-15 04:32:29,fy42z73,t3_hr4rvf,t1_fy428z0,"&gt;	As you can see, nuclear energy has by far the highest capacity factor of any other energy source. This basically means nuclear power plants are producing maximum power more than 93% of the time during the year. That’s about 1.5 to 2 times more as natural gas and coal units, and 2.5 to 3.5 times more reliable than wind and solar plants.  Yes 🤷‍♂️  Nukes are reliable, sure, but not impressed with this piece. Gas plants are available more hours than they produce because they have the *ability*to shut off when not exonomic. That’s a feature not a bug."
DV82XL,2020-07-15 04:44:20,fy43zbp,t3_hr4rvf,t1_fy42z73,You are confounding baseload generators with peaking plants. The article is comparing baseload nuclear with baseload gas plants. These are quite different than peakers. Combined cycle gas burners are designed to run continously just like nuclear plants and don't shut down that often mostly because of the time it takes to get the bottom part of the cycle up and running.  Peaking plants on the other hand only work a few hours a day and have very short black start times.
Canaveral58,2020-07-15 07:31:55,fy4ft3r,t3_hr4rvf,t1_fy3p45g,"Guess my point is moot then, still keep what’s left tho until gas/coal/oil is phased out"
iwriteaboutthings,2020-07-15 11:15:03,fy4tafu,t3_hr4rvf,t1_fy43zbp,"I’m not, I know the terms.   I’m saying “running time per year” is not a measure of reliability. By that same measure my brand new Toyota is not reliable because I only drove it two hours per day. A nuke with a 50% capacity favor and multiple scrams is not reliable, but likely still has a capacity factor of a peaker that may have been available 100% of hours it was needed."
DV82XL,2020-07-15 11:37:57,fy4uw4g,t3_hr4rvf,t1_fy4tafu,"Your logic is very thin given that commercial nuclear plants that have that sort of profile simply do not exist, but I assume that your argument is one of criticizing poorly applied semantics.   However the dictionary definition of reliable is:  the quality of being able to be trusted or believed because of *working or behaving well*, (my emphasis) and a high capacity factor falls broadly within that given the role of a generating plant."
paulfdietz,2020-07-15 11:47:46,fy4vlyy,t3_hr4rvf,t3_hr4rvf,Being able to run 24/7:  ok.  Having to run 24/7 or the economics go all to hell:  not so much.

iwriteaboutthings,2020-07-15 12:24:13,fy4ygo8,t3_hr4rvf,t1_fy4uw4g,"I *started* this about semantics. Nukes are reliable, but this article provides almost no evidence of it. Equating capacity factor to reliability only serves to mislead people about the strengths of nuclear or other fuel sources.   Running 90% of the hours of a year is not an important attribute for the maintenance of grid reliability and keeping the lights on. A reliable plant is one that functions as expected and can be counted on when needed. It’s about availability, not running time."
DV82XL,2020-07-15 13:20:14,fy53k07,t3_hr4rvf,t1_fy4ygo8,"You are still splitting hairs as far as I am concerned and most people wouldn't know the difference, nor is this particularly misleading in any broad sense as certainly the MTBF on NPPs are better than most other thermal plants (likely due to lower temperatures) and certainly they beat wind and solar in reliability, if as I think you are implying in your argument,  that reliability in this context is equivalent to dispatchablity as the term is understood in the electric power domain.  The public, to the extent that we have to worry about their opinions want only three things from a source: it is there when they throw the switch, it is as inexpensive as possible, and it has a low impact on the environment."
