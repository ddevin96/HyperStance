I have friends in Russia who used to think the US was stupid for letting everyone have guns, now they think our right to self defense for everyone is one of the best things about the country.

Even the girls were laughing and putting .308 down range with big scary battle rifles, some stayed here and got married, they'll help us change culture here and the ones who went back home will still remember that guns are fun, if nothing more.  Edit: anti gunners will almost always outspend us by orders of magnitude but winning the cultural war counts for so much more.

However, British public sentiment has just been so completely brainwashed since the 1920-present campaign of fear paid off(when the government started serious gun control because they were scared of armed revolt). Barely anyone wants to campaign for gun rights, much less protest. I did do a thing for the independence referendum where I asked what kind of things people would want in a constitution, and surprisingly about 34% of the people I asked were actually supportive of a second amendment.

And Trump stood on the NRA floor telling us that no one will infringe on our 2a rights now.

But it is also clear the reason you have those rights is to be able to form one.    It's a slight difference from stating you have a right to self-defense.  For example, in no state can you start a fight, and then claim self defense after you shot the other person."

They ruled that the 2nd amendment was an individual right and one of the reasons they cited was for self-defense in the landmark DC vs. Heller case.  SCOTUS specifically noted that said individual right was **unconnected to service in a militia.**  You don‚Äôt seem to understand what the Constitution is. It‚Äôs not a document which grants rights to citizens.   It is a document which **prevents or limits the amount of infringement by government** on a number of innate rights.  In other words, the Constitution protects a number of rights all humans innately have."

velocibadgery,2020-06-20 22:23:35,fvhcwos,t3_hcs9b9,t1_fvh4tg1,"The constitution does not grant rights.  Rights are inherent and pre-existing.  The constitution restrains the government from infringing on certain enumerated rights.  But the 9th amendment makes clear that enumerated rights are not the only rights to exist, and that the government is similarly restrained from infringing on non-enumerated rights.  So yes, the right to self defense is protected by the 9th amendment of the constitution in conjunction with the 2nd amendment.  Also DC v. Heller said that the right of the people to keep and bear arms is disconnected from militia service, and that case recognized self defense as a reason for 2nd amendment protections.  So you are 100% completely and utterly wrong."

The whole proletariat must be armed at once with muskets, rifles, cannon and ammunition, and the revival of the old-style citizens‚Äô militia, directed against the workers, must be opposed. Where the formation of this militia cannot be prevented, the workers must try to organize themselves independently as a proletarian guard, with elected leaders and with their own elected general staff; they must try to place themselves not under the orders of the state authority but of the revolutionary local councils set up by the workers. Where the workers are employed by the state, they must arm and organize themselves into special corps with elected leaders, or as a part of the proletarian guard. Under no pretext should arms and ammunition be surrendered; any attempt to disarm the workers must be frustrated, by force if necessary. The destruction of the bourgeois democrats‚Äô influence over the workers, and the enforcement of conditions which will compromise the rule of bourgeois democracy, which is for the moment inevitable, and make it as difficult as possible ‚Äì these are the main points which the proletariat and therefore the League must keep in mind during and after the approaching uprising.    .     &gt;America is the *only* pro gun place on Earth. The idea that calling communism as it is somehow degrades my argument is ridiculous.     The idea of making false statements brings into doubt whether anything you say is researched and/or truthful.     &gt;Communism demands equality of outcome, and not equality of opportunity, which directly flies in the face of what America is. Communist and socialist regimes have routinely disarmed it's people. Just because you make a claim that Marx was pro gun, doesn't make it true,     Well, but it is true...     &gt;and just because you claim that I am uneducated does not make that true either.     Seems like I proved that...     &gt;If you would like to make a counter argument, you would need to use more than just your own opinion.

Better is the enemy if good.  Chasing better can often lead to an unstable patient resulting in a worse outcome.  You have to understand when what you have is as good as you are likely to get and support that.  Biden is horrible.  Trump depending on you philosophy is either good, or marginal.  He definitely has problems.  Chasing better will likely lead us to a worse outcome.  Especially when there is much he does to make things better for gun owners despite the willful ignorance of many of us who refuse to acknowledge it.  There is plenty to not like about the man, but frankly he is willing to do some great things most politicians wouldn't.  Renegotiating NAFTA has been great for the us.

They‚Äôre both saying the same exact thing, the only difference is how you look at it.   If owning a gun was a basic human inalienable right, everyone around the world would be able to posses one. Even if we take foreign countries out of this debate and look solely at the United States, there are still members of our society who do not have this right. If ‚Äúinalienable‚Äù means unable to be taken away, why is this right taken away from those in jail or prison? One could argue that the need for self defense is great in prison, especially since there‚Äôs an extremely high number of people who have committed extremely violent acts. But these people cannot own or possess a gun. So if someone, like the government, can take away this right, then this right is *not* inalienable by definition."

I don't see what you hope to gain by having that switch 4 years sooner with less time to repair the damage to the courts that Obama did.  It is only a matter of time before democrats hold all both chambers and the presidency.  Why on earth would you want that to happen any quicker?  Especially when we are one justice short of having a solid conservative majority with mostly young justices and a liberal who is old as shit and likely currently has cancer.  Also, I said that's an outcome I could be happy with not my plan.  My plan would be to not let Biden win.  If you have a problem with that plan, what do you possibly think we as gun owners could possibly have to gain with a Biden presidency?"

A blue win in 2020 means that the Senate will stay red in 2020, and the house and senate will turn redder in both the 2022 midterms, and the 2024 presidential election.  Governor and state legislature races will also slide to the right.  We focus on state-level pro-gun legislation for the next 4 years.  I think we could replace the myriad of reciprocity agreements with an interstate CCW compact that would become the framework for national reciprocity. That can happen if the states shift red in 2022. But that red shift won't happen if Trump stays in office.   The blue tidal wave you're forecasting for 2024 is only an inevitability if Trump wins in 2020. I don't see any significant advantages to having Trump for the next 4 years.  Sure, he gets a few more federal judges appointed, but we lose ground on red flag laws and expanded carry restrictions."

The only times a president'a party has gained in both the house and senate were FDR during the Great Depression, and G.W.

I'm a gun owner and I'm curious, when was the last time you fought oppression with your firearm?    Anyway, the only thing that will preserve our right to bear arms in its current state (or a better i.e. more Constitutional state), is a change in US culture.    The thing working against us is that in most countries with large populations that have had restrictions on gun ownership, the firearm homicide rate (and the homicide rate in general) is quite low, usually a lot lower than the US.  [Intentional homicides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate) in 2018 (per 100k population):  US: 4.96, just under Kazakhstan(5.00) and worse than Chile (4.40)and North Korea( 4.40).  UK: 1.20, tied with France (1.20).  Sweden, Denmark, Austria, Iceland, Germany, Greece, Ireland - all around 1.00 or so.  The [firearm-related](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate) homicide stats are more telling (per 100k):  US: 4.46 (compare this with the above number and it looks like most intentional homicides are committed with a firearm in the US)  UK: 0.06 (compare this with the above number and yeah, people are still killing each other without guns, but they seem to be far less successful)  Assuming you live in a free state that doesn't require gun registration like I do, they'll never be able to confiscate all our guns, there are just too many in circulation.  However, if we want to stop the erosion of gun rights there has to be a change in the culture of the US and I don't see that happening anytime soon."

Unfortunately I‚Äôm from Eastern Europe, we had great gun ownership traditions, but then we were occupied so natives were denied guns, then our elites were sent to death camps, labor camps or shot in the head. When communists took over only the ruling class had guns and propaganda machine against gun ownership started.   So, if you were denied gun ownership for 200 years and under propaganda influence for over 50 years, it is VERY hard."

You make it harder to get a permit, make people register their guns, only allow certain types of guns.   It's essentially already happening in the US. Just not because of whatever dictatorship you might be afraid of. Guns are great for one thing. Making it almost impossible to be invaded by another country.   But it's an illusion to think they are great for sieging your own country.  And the illusion of safety."

Once the Soviet Union collapsed a lot of gangsters, murderers, racketeers and drug dealers started to crawl out of their holes, so guns for regular people were needed. I'm from Lithuania and our country is completely pro self-defense. Back in the 90s there was a story that 8 gangsters tried to racketeer a shop owner on the Christmas eve. The shop owner killed 4 and wounded other 4 severely. Instead of a complete backlash, he was praised ""the man of the year""."

More gun laws that we know what to do with an inability to defend ourselves. My father was taken to jail after he was attacked. Even though about 30 witnesses came to the police before they arrested him and told them what happened it didn't matter he had to be arrested. Meanwhile the other guy was carted off to a hospital and was given the chance to press charges it wasn't until this wonderful old black guy went to the police station with my father did they actually decide to drop the charges. It's just a backsliding mess up here with zero regards for the less fortunate provinces.

Their recent denial of certiorari in every 2A case demonstrates they can't be relied upon to protect us.

You might be able to shoot someone trying to punch you, depending on various circumstances (trained fighter, under influence, very agressive, threatening death/serious bodily injury).

Meaning the concentration is really high - and mostly to enthusiasts. It just so happens that guns are massively destructive and not what most people see fit for the average person. And to that effect, that it really isn't that big a problem to slowly and sanely reduce the amount of guns.  I think you overestimate the criminal mind. Criminals are poor and desperate.  At least 90% of them. The other 10% is white collar crime. The harder you make guns to obtain, the more valuable they are. So guns would become quite expensive to come by. It's not like there is a store that would buy up as many guns as possible, in the face of the future regulation - in fact the regulation could just be a tax on sales of guns. But back to my idea - No one is buying up guns to keep them cheap for criminals.  The reason criminals in other countries don't use guns, is first and foremost because they know the store doesn't have a gun, so it isn't necessary. And that they are actually calculating, how many years in prison using a knife vs using a gun gives you. It's worth it - to use a gun, if you are afraid of the store owner using a gun, but otherwise it isn't worth it. And obviously, guns are expensive and most crimes like robbing a store is because of lack of money.  So who is left. What kind of rich well connected criminals are we afraid of? This isn't Ocean 11. Even the guys who stole Mona Lisa did so without guns, because you don't need a gun. The amount of people we are talking about is almost non existent.  Remember, the most violent criminals in Europe, isn't even near as violent as the average criminal in the US. I say it, to remind you. That it seems like you are thinking that current criminals in the US stays the same, while everyone else is just losing out. That's not the case. In fact, you could make the regulation such that the criminals loses out first and therefore the deescalation of violence isn't a problem.     In the few cases, where you have criminals with guns, vs now unarmed people. The criminals would be less violent as well. It's why the overall violence is reduced on every level of violent crime."

Trayvon went inside as Zimmerman talked the police on the phone, had Trayvon done nothing violent at all the police would have shown up and told Zimmerman to fuck off, instead Trayvon attacks Zimmerman, who ONLY THEN pulls his weapon and shoots Trayvon in lawful self defense.

If that's you, you have never spent one day on earth as a man. Also I don't question the second amendment being a personal right. But it is clear what the obligations of that right are. Community. Trayvon was a boy. I am 46 and I have never feared a boy in my life. Tell you what, you can pull your weapon and leave puddles where ever you want.

The lawmakers know what they are doing, they have all the relevant data, don't think for a moment they just remain blissfully ignorant of people's struggles.   They know that poor communities, particularly communities of colour are the most vulnerable, that they have the longest police response times, when police respond at all. This is no different than the Mulford Act in California in the 60's in response to the Black Panther Party. It is intended to disarm the public to make citizens ever more reliant on the police for their safety, instead of themselves and their communities and their families.  Sure, the rich neighborhoods, the gated communities, they don't have any need with their private security patrols and their houses insured down to the last chandelier. But what about everyone else? What'll happen to them?  It's easy to point to the murder of Ahmaud Arbery and say that it wouldn't have happened without Stand Your Ground. It's wrong, but it's easy to say. But what about everyone else who isn't a racist thug out to murder? What about all the people who have never felt safe with just the word of the police that they'll keep the community safe?

Essentially syg exists because prosecutors don't care if your actions are legal or not.

Barb0ssa,2020-06-30 17:55:42,fwhxjhf,t3_hcs9b9,t1_fwhabze,"Hey,  thanks for your detailed answer while on mobile.  That only 8 unarmed black peole got killed, plays into my argument about it being easier shooting at armed peole (but also what means armed in that case, is a knife in the pocket enough?). But you are right that there are many aspects to consider, when comparing germany to the US. In germany 14 people got killed by police in 2019 in total and I am pretty sure this number would be enormously higher with legal gun possession. Also with an estimated 10 - 40 million (I think 20mil is the estimate from the police union) illegal guns in germany, there are still very few gun related crimes here. And only 5% of these very few are involving a gun fired but also count all the blank guns..  so we really don't have visible gun related crimes here and I am very happy about that.  My point about police (in my answer above) was mainly about the cops being more frightened. Of course there are many factors to consider here, too. But I didn't mean the healthcare or society related ones, because there are major differences between germany and the US here.   I didn't say that police in america is shooting at unarmed people with no reason. Only that the cops are more likely to shoot when they have to fear that everyone is carrying a gun. And that german police would shoot more people if we had legal gun posession laws. Of course there a some illegal guns in germany and it's a problem that it's still too easy to get a legal gun for sports.   &amp;#x200B;  But the overall police mentality and stress level is different, because our cops are not that afraid to die in every situation with unknown civilians. In return, I don't have to fear getting pulled out or randomly controlled. I don't have to fear calling the police because I only expect help from them and no danger. The normal german citizens are not carrying a weapon and police here is normally trying to deescalate situations.   In the US many police encounters show cops escalating a situation, using excessive force and telling people the unthruth (like telling people they will go to jail if they are not obedient to the cop.) This may be due to the lack of regulation and oversight of police. But I still think that **fear** is a big factor here.   When I am getting pulled out by police, they will realise that I am not dangerous to them pretty quick. They can take my piss and make their stupid tests to judge my sobriety, but they **never** have their hands on the gun. They can have relaxed small talk with you. The whole situation is stress free, the cops are doing their job and have to fear nothing from a normal citizen. In the US too many normal controls end deadly. Even people who called the police themself are getting shot, dogs are getting shot..   &amp;#x200B;  Cops in the US pull out their gun directly, and then start to question the people an""deescalate"" them (while pointing a deadly tool at them). If police would point a gun at me for no reason, I would **freak out** because in that moment I am in serious risk of dead. The human reaction of freaking out or panicking in a situation where your life is at risk, should not end in being shot. But sadly this is the case when cops have the gun out and are expecting to be in danger themselves.   I wouldn't call it trigger-happy in general (even if there are many trigger-happy cops in the US) but trigger-nervousness instead. And one origin of this is the broad distribution of legally possessed guns. But of course there are many other factors to it. Like the normality of shooting guns alone. When something is normalised it always goes easier. In germany most people never shoot a gun in their lives. And I remember the fear and respect I had when I shot .50 BMG the first time (on a shooting range in germany). It was really not an easy feeling when shooting that beast of a weapon, but I think it shouldn't be an easy or normal feeling.  &amp;#x200B;  I know I didn't get to all of your points but sadly I have to leave now and will post it as is. Looking forward to your answer.  **Also I have to say regarding the post, I definitely think all the americans should use their 2A right and get guns. If you have a system like this, it only works when all the citizens, from all ethnicities and political directions, use that right and create a balance.**   Cheers ;)"

You can neutralize the threat regardless if they are attacking you or not.   Outside, it's tricky. Some states, you have a duty to retreat. Someone threatens or attacks you, you have to try and escape first. In SYG states, you can shoot first if you have a ""reasonable fear for your life"".

Everything is designed to get people into prison as early as possible. You get in for drug possesion, (which shouldn't be a crime if for personal use at all) and in prison you get your apprenticeship in crime. They even put you in solitary for several months and then set you on the street again without any psychological examination.  For me this looks clearly like actively turning people into criminals and mentally unstable people on a huge scale. And with privatised prisons this is a money making machine, which should disgust every american citizen because it is unhuman and has nothing to do with the land of the free.   No other country on the world has that many prisoners/population as the US. And not because more criminals are born there, but because the system is broke and also racially biased. Drugs got prohibited ~1961 because it enabled police to but black people in prisons.

RenHo3k,2020-07-06 09:18:06,fx30szy,t3_hlzl2g,t3_hlzl2g,"Here‚Äôs the actual text of the bill.  It looks like it leaves the door wide open for police misinterpretation and warrantless searches, as well as (imo) punitive sentencing, recidivism, and packed prisons.  People should really read this stuff before voting up the headline:   http://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/member/2018/0058/latest/LMS40369.html  https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/hansard-debates/rhr/combined/HansDeb_20180905_20180905_23  ‚ÄúI want to assure those who are responsible firearm owners that this bill means onerous, unnecessary restrictions will not be placed on them. The bill does not target legal firearm owners and won't impinge on their freedoms. However, firearms prohibition orders, similar to what they have in New South Wales, will widen the powers available to police to search the homes and cars of serious violent gang members for firearms at any time. They will only apply to a very small group of the most dangerous gang offenders who have convictions of firearms offences and serious violence records.  The pool of eligible people is based on criteria set out in this legislation in a newly inserted section 59A. This specifies that if someone is a member of a gang and within the last 10 years has been convicted of an offence under the Arms Act, the Domestic Violence Act, or a serious violent offence in the Sentencing Act, the commissioner may put in place a firearms prohibition order. The offending history and the profile of these gang members make it reasonable for police to be able to check that they do not have access to guns, ammunition, or firearms parts.  It's estimated that around 600 gang members will be eligible for a firearms prohibition order, but it will be up to the Police Commissioner to determine how to prioritise the most serious offenders within that group. These people may pay no attention to needing a firearms licence, so we need to be able to search them to ensure that they don't have access to illegal firearms. The Commissioner of Police will have the power to make an order in respect of these offenders, and any decision to make an order will be reviewable by the District Court. That's very important‚Äîthere is the oversight of the District Court and the judicial system.  The Police Commissioner will have to personally sign off each order, and any person subject to an order will have the ability to challenge this in court. Currently, all warrantless searches require specialist internal reporting and police would be expected to continue reporting searches of persons, vehicles, and premises under this regime.  In the event of a breach of a firearms prohibition order, a person who contravenes section 59B(1) in clause 7, will be liable for a term of imprisonment not exceeding five years, or, in the case where the firearm is a pistol or restricted weapon, to a term not exceeding 14 years. In addition to the prohibition on possessing firearms, persons must not acquire or possess ammunition. Doing so will ensure they are liable upon conviction for a term of imprisonment not exceeding five years. If a firearms prohibition order has been placed on an individual, they're unable to reside at premises where firearms, parts, or ammunitions are present, and contravening this will also see them liable for conviction under the legislation.‚Äù //  Argument against:   ‚ÄúHon Dr DAVID CLARK (Minister of Health): In New South Wales, where they implemented similar legislation, as we've just heard from the member Chris Bishop, an ombudsman's review found multiple failings in this approach, including, in practice, where no firearms were located in over 600 searches. The bill itself sounds well-intentioned, but in fact it's actually ill-advised and doesn't address the issue‚Äîthe key issue‚Äîof how police ensure only fit and proper people hold a firearms licence or have access to firearms. I'm sure everyone in this House is wondering why‚Äîwhy‚Äîif this is so important, the National Government, who've only been out of office for one year, didn't do something to address this over their nine years here on this side of the House.  Hon Ruth Dyson: How long were they in Government?  Hon Dr DAVID CLARK: They were here for nine years, and certainly the statistics I've seen suggest that gun violence has been pretty static over that most recent five-year period. It doesn't seem to be a big issue, but suddenly it has become a big issue when the politics have changed. This is a knee-jerk reaction. It's actually about enabling the extension of searches without warrants‚Äîplain and simple.  This is a bill that undermines human rights principles and enables the extension of searches without warrants. In fact, it puts the police in an invidious position. They've recommended the Government not support this bill. The bill, they say, has serious flaws and will not deliver on the intent as outlined in the general policy statement. That's from the police‚Äîthe people the member purports to want to be supporting here. The fit and proper person test already, effectively, bans gang members and prospects from holding firearms licences. The way the law is drafted now has restrictions around who can hold a firearms licence, and this does nothing except promote searches without warrants. Concerns have been raised about police accountability, and, of course, human rights legislation where searches can be made on subjective reasoning rather than on sufficient facts.  Here's the kicker‚Äîhere's the kicker: there's a National Party member who said not so long ago that the National Party firmly believes, or this person firmly believes, that searches should not be enforced without warrants, apparently in complete contradiction to the bill's intent. And who do we think it was who said out there, publicly, that searches should not be enforced without warrants? Well, it was none other than the National Party leader. The National Party leader doesn't seem to support the intent of this bill. Here is a member trying to put through something that he popped in the biscuit tin because he thought it would be popular‚Äîactually, it undermines human rights. All it does is extend searches without warrants. I bet that member's feeling a bit awkward right now, because what this bill does and doesn't do will be laid completely bare in this debate that we're having now.‚Äù"

I feel like possession of any small arm imaginable is just fine and not inherently wrong so long as you don't do anything violent with said weapon.   That means that not obeying said laws is juuust fine.   Keeping in mind of course that at one point in time there were laws in this country against different ethnicities marrying one another and there were laws against various sex acts.

Simply going though history and pointing out who's black and who's not doesn't tell the full story.   I wish more of our historiography would acknowledge this important principle."

Death-T,2020-07-11 05:06:11,fxlx2qo,t3_hos45i,t1_fxku5hf,"Sure thing. First let's talk about the 1619 project; a revisionist theory of American history founded by a leftist university professor that is now becoming mainstream. The 1619 project teaches that America was founded on slavery in the year 1619 (not 1776 on the Declaration of Independence), and it teaches that the Revolutionary War was fought to protect the institution of slavery in America.    Look at how the AP covered Trump's visit to Mount Rushmore versus how they covered Obama's and other Democrat presidents. Look at progressive icons like Kaepernick calling July 4th a holiday that celebrates white supremacy. The movement to make Juneteenth a national holiday is very much the same movement that is vilifying the 4th of July as a white supremacist holiday. Juneteenth is the holiday that socially aware progressives will celebrate, and July 4th is being painted as the holiday that narrow minded, backwards thinking, white privilege-having bigots celebrate. Kaepernick signed a contract to do a history-teaching program on the Disney Plus streaming service and Netflix is doing some kind of 1619 project documentary. This all goes hand-in-hand with the Orwellian erasing of our history and the attacks on our historical statues and monuments, this includes attacks on Mount Rushmore, the 54th Massachusets Regiment. Frederick Douglas, Abraham Lincoln, and others...not JUST confederate monuments. There is a very clear effort forming on the Left to vilify American patriotism and to drive black Americans away from it. That's why the Left vilifies the Flag and it's why they chose Kneeling During The National Anthem as the symbol of the BlackLivesMatter movement in the NFL. The Flag, the national anthem, football, and reverence for our founders used to unify us all as Americans. Not anymore. It's why, for the first time in history, the NFL will play a so called Black National Anthem before they play the American one. Everyone will stand for the Black National Anthem (or risk being cancelled), and most, if not all, will kneel during the American one."

Here‚Äôs where I think you can improve your analysis:  Since you are correct that the US Federal government picks winners and losers by subsidizing industry, I would argue that the answer lies in NOT doing it.  It‚Äôs called ‚Äúcrony capitalism‚Äù and it is not capitalism at all. It‚Äôs a rigged, corrupt system made worse every time we grow government and thereby centralize more power in fewer hands.  Instead of making the case that government should use its massive centralized power to redistribute wealth, as communists do, I recommend making government smaller, as Libertarians suggest.  Smaller government makes those in power more accountable to those they serve and thereby slows corruption.  As things stand today, a single person in the private sector only needs to influence a single person in government to affect policy for hundreds of millions of people.  This is a terrible system.  Imagine if there was a single global government whereby the same few thousand people that are in charge of the US and Europe were in charge of all 7 billion of us?  Horrible.  The answer you seek is this...  Decentralization."

Everyone does.  The problem is that a Marxist is a threat to liberty.  His or her ideology, if successfully implemented, will be the end of any kind of freedom in America.  Marxist ideology cannot be implemented without a totalitarian state in which civilian armament is prohibited.  So the person you‚Äôre responding to is *also* correct, in that objectively speaking, in order to preserve a free country, armed Marxists are indeed a very bad thing.  Even though they have the freedom to arm themselves.  Best option, since both freedom-lovers and Marxists are still free, is to make sure to arm oneself and one‚Äôs companions better than the Marxists, so that they can never successfully use force to achieve their anti-democratic goals."

spazfest,2020-07-12 03:05:30,fxsikv4,t3_hplpwq,t1_fxs7932,"Hear me out for a second, okay? I know you're upset and maybe you think we're all just nutjobs, but let me ask you a simple question.  Our government's branches maintain stability with one another through checks and balances, the idea being that no one branch, be it executive, legislative, or judicial, should be able to overpower another. We see these check and balances invoked every now and again, a presidential veto on a law, SCOTUS ruling on an unconstitutional law, etc.   Similarly, the government as a whole has its power checked by the people. We make sure that the government doesn't overstep its bounds by making electoral choices every couple of years.  The issue here is what people should do when the government refuses to act on the wishes of the governed. Of course, our nation is founded on the idea of a social contract, and so when the government stops properly representing their constituents, it has broken that social contract.   However, the government, having control over the police and the military, while also having the logistical wherewithal to control them at even a local level, may chose to abandon that social contract and operate in an unconstitutional manner.   In such a case, one our Founding Fathers lived in and one that many nations have fought through, we the People would have the responsibility to get up and forcibly remove the government officials from power and fill the vacancies as we normally would. We would accomplish this the same way Washington, Jefferson, and so many others did in 1776, by using our natural right to bear arms. We are legally compelled, really, to do so by the Constitution, that is the purpose of the 2nd Amendment, to give the People an exit clause in the case that the government becomes tyrannical, no matter how slim that chance may be.  Now, if the People choose to legislate their rights away, and the government, whether local, state, or federal, begins to confiscate arms from the citizens, what tools will we be left with to remove a tyrant?  I don't want to assume your political affiliation, but I will give you the following scenario:  Let's say Trump wakes up tomorrow and decides he wants to be the first King of America. As Commander-In-Chief, he has control over the entire military. All he would have to do is call the Army or the Marines to storm DC and he would effectively be a true dictator, even if only a fraction of servicemen follow these orders.  Would you not want guns that would allow you to have a fighting chance against the Army? What about the Police? Should you, as a free citizen, not have the right to defend yourself with the same armaments that a potentially tyrannical government has? Would you prefer to be defenseless in the face of a real, powerful, and determined fascist dictatorship?  I think that's a better insight into our state of mind when we see increasing government encroachment. We are equally disturbed about the rise in unjustified police violence and the ease with which it's dismissed by higher authorities, and it's precisely why we are clinging to our guns harder than ever; because when the shit really, and I mean truly, hits the fan, it's the only thing that stands between you and a life under an oppressive regime.   Edit: I hate autocorrect sometimes."

Someone flags down a cop to report a mugging. Cool, mugging is illegal. Cop chases down a suspect that matches the description, but did not observe the mugging and the suspect says they didn't do nothing. Well, what to do? We cannot arrest the suspect on the word of another citizen, right? But we can search them! And a search produces a stick for which they have no lawful purpose. Off to jail with you! Justice is served!  Except it's not. Now you have secondary offense crimes for virtually everything. Gives cops unlimited ways to arrest and charge anyone they don't like. Tons of innocent people mistakenly punished for carrying a stick. Self-defense basically illegal. Muggings become more common.  Nice."

redditpulledmebackin,2020-07-14 05:55:26,fy0e9vt,t3_hqmp9h,t1_fy0c3ar,"I changed my mind about the baton thing, but that‚Äôs a straw mans argument. Seriously, fists vs baton you can‚Äôt say that‚Äôs a fair match.  Sure a fist can kill you but it‚Äôs much much less likely.  Hitting someone on the skull with a baton is no where near the same thing as a punch to the head. A baton to the skull is almost a guarantee kill, or permanent damage. A weak swing with a baton could break your skull, a weak fist is exactly that, a weak fist. Can you get Ko or die, yes, but how likely is it? Less likely than a baton. I don‚Äôt trust the general public, but op changed my mind on batons, it is a better alternative than the weapons that are actually legal. I still don‚Äôt think people should be able to walk around With a baton without at least a breakdown of its effects. Some cops can‚Äôt even be trusted with a baton"

Markdd8,2020-07-14 10:22:06,fy0ujhm,t3_hqmp9h,t3_hqmp9h,"Large umbrellas are a pretty good weapon, but you generally look weird carrying one in clement weather. Don't hit with it, you stab, holding it 2 handed, hands about equal thirds on it.  It can ward of people pretty well; they carry the obvious potential of a stab to the eye.  I suppose you could wrap paper around it a bit and that way less people would notice it.  Or get an umbrella cover. Authorities are big on prosecuting hidden weapons (from what other posters here write, Calif. will bust you for carrying a stick)  but I don't think any bust would fly for a covered  umbrella.  I live in a rainy city and walk a lot at night, so carry it almost always, cause the streets here are sketchy.  Would feel uncomfortable if I didn't have it at night.  Umbrella fends off dogs very good also.  You feel naked walking around without any weapon."

And I'm still not sure on being able to carry an expandable baton my sister says she can but from what I've read online it looks like you can't.

thischildslife,2020-07-17 21:31:41,fyehlyl,t3_hos45i,t1_fxoz7ob,"Bro, whatever mistakes the man made in his past, by all accounts he'd paid his dues and turned his life around.    They accused him of passing a fake $20, even if it were true, do you think he actually minted that himself?  Not f'ing likely.  It was prob un-intentionally passed to him the same way he un-intentionally passed it to the store.  This man was not a counterfeiting mastermind.  Anyone begging for their life and asking for help from the people supposed to ""protect &amp; serve"" deserves a bit of mercy.  Those police gave him none.  I don't think they intentionally set out to harm him; I think it was one of those things that happens when police get jaded and complacent.  Unfortunately that appears to be one of the side-effects of law enforcement profession.   U.S. Police need better training, counseling, and support for their own mental health.  Come to think of it, we could probably all use some of those things.  Peace."
