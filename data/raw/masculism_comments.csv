SaulsAll,2019-07-08 15:20:58,et9kpvn,t3_caj83v,t3_caj83v,"Always an enjoyable read.  I had some thoughts on the article.  Having worked in customer service, I know the demand to be seen as always happy, and the pressure put on employees to ""just smile and take it.""  I apparently have a dour ""resting face"" so I would get this ""advice"" from people a lot.  And I'll say nothing sours your mood faster than being told you aren't happy *enough.*  At the same time, appearance and mood *are* important in customer service, and it not wrong for a manager to want their employees smiling.  Hopefully, though, they ask about underlying reasons and *also* want their employees actually happy instead of just plastering a smile on their face.  This leads to the non-work aspect of people telling other - especially women - to smile.  I agree this can often come from a place of concern, yet I think a close look at wording can give insight as to when it might be taken for caring, and might be taken for misogyny.  I've often seen/heard phrases such as ""*give us* a smile,"" or, ""smile *for me*."" This indicates a desire for a non-smiling person to smile for the viewer's benefit rather than their own.  It reinforces a visual objectification of the person.  I don't think wanting someone to smile should be seen as a bad thing, but perhaps one should be certain they actually want the person - man or woman - to be feeling better rather than just want them to look pretty in one's own view.  And perhaps a whole new topic could be considered on why we don't seem to care as much when a man is saddened and not smiling."

Silverfox17421,2020-06-03 05:32:52,fspuq8j,t3_gvme6g,t3_gvme6g,"Every feminist out there will tell that there is no such thing as Equity Feminism. They say that EF's are just MRA's, and feminists hate MRA's. Hell, most feminists even hate Men's Libbers, and they are wildly feminist and as cucked and pathetic as it gets. They hate Men's Libbers because *they're for the men*. You can't be for the men *at all*. If you're for the men, *you're an MRA*, and MRA's are the enemy.  And if you spout Equity Feminist views, real feminists will come around, blast you, and call you misogynist and say, ""You still call yourself a feminist?!"" In short, don't bother to call yourself an Equity Feminist.  Call yourself an Equalist. That's what I do. You can call yourself a masculinist if you like it, but I don't think feminists will like it too much.  The only proper way to be a feminist is to be a Gender Feminist, a viciously misandrist movement. 99% of the feminists I encounter are misandrist. They are full of anger, rage, hostility, hatred, or most of all, vengeance. Feminsim is about paybacks. And you know what they say on the street? Paybacks are a bitch.   They want their pound of flesh out of us men, and even that won't satisfy them because no matter how much we pathetically cuck out, they will just keep moving the goalposts forever as we get more and more screwed. None of these movements have an endgame. They're designed to go on forever. Even if they reach their goal - total female  supremacism - they will need to keep feminism around to enforce any male backlash, that is if there are any of us non-cucks left to fight back.  Feminists are manhaters. Period. Why do you even have feminist friends in the first place? Feminists are the enemies of the men, especially of the activist men like masculinists.   This is a war to the end. There will be no peace with the feminists.  PS I am actually a Leftist, believe it or not. And I'm not the only one. More and more liberal and Leftist men are sounding like me these days. Feminists have gone too far for a lot of men of the Left."

_this_man,2020-06-03 06:25:53,fspyt3t,t3_gvme6g,t3_gvme6g,"Feminists usually are in the ""who got it worse"" competition mode when it comes to women's and men's issues. They are simply incapable of understanding that nobody ""has it worse"". Men and women have their own problems. But feminists are stuck in this ""women are the victims in the society"" mentality and will go on absurds lengths in an attempt to prove it.  They usually are genuinely stupid and don't display any critical thinking abilities. Feminists just repeat the same ideological crap they heard somewhere. Very often they'll give you a source to prove their point and then after 5 minutes of reading you realise that they haven't even read it themselves.  And if you ever bring up men's issues, be prepared for this logic they'll have:   \- Mens issues: it's men's fault   \- Women's issues: it's men's fault"

AmuseDeath,2020-06-03 11:36:00,fsqjmw7,t3_gvme6g,t3_gvme6g,"It's usually a bad idea. I asked someone if they were feminist and they later told somebody else that I was laughing at her sexual assault story.  The thing with feminism is that there are a lot of crazies and misguided people that have changed gender discourse for the worse. The founder of the movement have roots in racism where they pushed for voting for white women over black men and were against passing the 14th and 15th amendment.  Then there are feminists who will say, well what damage has feminism done? Well the feminists on top who control the most influence and money have pushed for sexist legislation that harms men:  https://old.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/7s832j/dont_worry_a_man_will_clean_it_up/dt34lgm/  Feminism constantly ignores the issues men face and blames men for their own problems. If you were to tell them that men constitute 3/4 of all suicides, they'll say it's because of the patriarchy instead of saying how bad it is and what they can do to help.  Feminism discourages women to think for themselves and claims monopoly when talking about gender equality. According to them, feminism is the definition of gender equality, so if you aren't a feminist, you must be against gender equality:  https://www.latimes.com/fashion/la-ig-wwd-gal-gadot-revlon-20180109-story.html  ""Whoever is not a feminist, is a sexist""  Feminism doesn't encourage critical thinking, nor does it emphasize using facts or data. Women who criticize parts of the movement are told that they have internalized misogyny to shut them up. It's as if the only way to be a proper woman is to be a feminist. Sounds pretty sexist to me.  Feminism is not the female equivalent of Men's Rights because they aren't just about pushing for women's rights. Feminism has a lot of misguided theories and off-the-wall ideas that it shoves down the throats of its members. These theories are either unproven or straight up false. The wage gap for example doesn't exist. I cannot hire a female in 2020 and pay her 80% of what I pay a male for the same position. No economist takes this statistic seriously. There have been multiple fair-wage laws such as the Lilly Ledbetter Act in 2009. There is no rape culture. Rapes in America are taken very seriously and they are prosecuted, not celebrated. In fact, men can be detained and prosecuted simply on a claim of rape, even if it is unproven. You get cases like Brian Banks where a girl can claim rape without proof and a guy can lose years of his life. FBI reports and police anecdotes have made the claim that false rape accusations happen 10-40% of the time. The Male Gaze is a derogatory theory that lumps every male who admires female beauty as some sort of creep. Women do this just as much as men, yet of course feminists don't acknowledge this.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilly_Ledbetter_Fair_Pay_Act_of_2009  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Banks_(American_football)  https://old.reddit.com/r/Egalitarianism/comments/grgc8y/the_truth_about_false_rape_allegations_2_figure/  https://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/947/231/b83.jpg  The single biggest problem with feminism is that it is not rooted on reason or logic. It is a feel-good fantasy where its members are told exactly what they want to hear - that they are victims and it trains them to retaliate against any outside thought or any time they would have to take responsibility. As a person who is for science, data and progress, I cannot consciously ever become a feminist because of how its is founded on false hateful theories and how its members constantly resist being told the truth about feminist dogma. Any person that supports reason and open-mindedness cannot support feminism.  While Men's Rights strives to bring awareness of men using data and facts, the female equivalent of it is NOT feminism. The correct counterpart would be Women's Rights. This movement would focus on women's rights, yet leave out all of the feminist dogma and fantasy that its leaders have concocted to keep its members in order and to put down men. So again the difference here is that Men's Rights doesn't have theories like the Female Gaze or Castration Culture floating around. They simply look up the data from proper sources and they determine what are the most pressing issues that way. This is why Men's Rights is rooted on facts and logic, while feminism is anti-logic.  Feminism is a convenient crutch for a lot of women who cannot admit to fault. Look to no other than the wife of Reddit's CEO, or Serena Williams. She cheated in her match and was coached with hand signals. Does she admit it? Of course not. She cheated because tennis is against women:  https://nypost.com/2018/09/08/patrick-mouratoglou-i-was-coaching-serena-during-match/  Feminism is a cancer to the logical mind. It is an movement that is so easy and so attractive to women to jump into. It lures them into it by telling that all the problems in their life is due to a single source of evil: patriarchy. By doing this, it unites all of its members. It's really easy to because its members look alike and have similar mannerism as they are all women. Men can ""help"" out by being allies but of course they won't ever be true victims as women are.  But of course they will never acknowledge how women have longer lifespans than men. They won't admit that girls are doing better than boys in elementary school. They won't admit that more women than men are in college. Or that our court system gives women lighter sentences for the same crime. Or that men make the majority of suicides, homicides and the incarcerated. Or that more men are on the streets, have much worse homeless shelters and have little to no domestic abuse shelters. They use the most successful men, Jeff Bezos, Donald Trump, Bill Gates to then say all men are like this. It would be the same logic as say that all women are as rich or influential as Oprah. And of course feminists and society as a whole won't admit that over 90% of the black deaths by police officers, the ones Black Lives Matter is fighting for, are actually black men.  So it's a bad idea because you are talking about, very, very confused people who accept whatever they've been told by feminist leaders. They aren't open-minded, they aren't willing to hear new ideas and they will call you an enemy if you question anything they say. They claim the monopoly on gender equality discourse and will not hear thoughts from any other side. You are dealing with very, very close-minded people who have mechanisms to fight against any counter-think and see people as feminist or enemy. They are represented by powerful people in print as well as many celebrities. They have already infiltrated our schools so they can brainwash people in college with an essentially worthless degree. They take advantage of the fact that women prefer to listen to each other over men, because that's how they are wired:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-group_favoritism#Automatic_bias_for_own_gender  Women in general do not and cannot understand the issues men go through. This woman already has preconceived notions of how men have it. Yet reality hits her hard and she admits her expectations were wrong:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZTIbHIsIYw  I would really question if you really think feminism is the way for you. I would ask yourself if you are for reason or for dogma. You can be for gender equality and you don't need to be feminist to do that. Good luck."

We need to stand with our sisters when that happens. But women have turned the tables and are now oppressing us a lot. And we need to stand up for ourselves when that happens. That's why I'm an equalist. I recommend it for everyone. Support fairness for men AND women.  Equal rights for women is great. We should all be for it. But modern feminism is just a hate cult against men. So we support equal legal rights for women (equity feminism) while opposing the gender feminist hate cult. It's a profoundly moral position.

Not because anyone forced them, but because the main concept of feminism is EQUALITY. If they say different, they aren't a real feminist. It's like a Christian saying they are murdering people for God, they aren't a true Christian.... Don't throw out buzzwords if you don't know how to use them.

NCFM was founded in 1977. I personally have been at this since the 90s. And feminists were the ones opposing us. You can say they weren't ""true feminists"" but that means that feminism didn't exist until the last few years, and even today most people who call themselves feminists are not feminists according to you.  If you want to learn more about the men's rights movement I would check out http://theredpillmovie.com/ which is a documentary by a feminist about MRAs. When she started learning about MRAs and feminism, she renounced feminism. There weren't many ""real feminists"" who supported her effort to raise awareness of men's issues.  And if you really want to get into the depth of our history, you can read [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Uneasy-Males-American-Movement-1970-2000/dp/0595373208) which covers the history of MRAs through 2000. This movement did not start recently and we have been fighting for men's issues a lot longer than the last few years, and for most of that time feminists were the ones opposing us. MRAs even started out as feminists, so they were the ""real feminists"" you're talking about, but the rest of the feminist movement forced us out."

It comes down to individuals. Are you talking to a friend who is even capable of having a true discussion? It seems rare to find these days.  I am a feminist. I believe that men also experience their share of issues. The struggles of one should not invalidate the struggles of another.   I think that a part of the problem is *when* to bring up the conversations. If you are in a discussion about men's issues, don't derail the convo by bringing up women's issues, and visa versa. When that happens it makes it sound like you are totally invalidating the other side. It's not a competition.   We all just need to have respect for eachother. It's like what people say about the left wing/right wing, they are both on the same bird. We are, on all sides, just people. And we need eachother."

I think that it's possible to build a space for dialogue between feminists and masculinists. We just have to put in the work to do it.   All that aside, do you think it would be better to formulate the topics not as being mens issues but instead point out how the issues effect women?   People are more willing to accept ideas if they have a ideological stake in the game. I've seen feminist journalists do this with some luck. For example, I read a report on how males lagging behind women academically negatively effects woman by reducing options in the dating market. Also, seen folks talking about how the high incarceration rate creates a lot of single moms.   Have you tried this tactic with any luck?"

Silverfox17421,2020-06-09 07:38:50,ftgehu1,t3_gvme6g,t1_ftg8on2,"That's fine if you have been a feminist your whole life. And there are serious issues with MRA's, first and foremost that most of them are reactionary. We need some sort of an MRA Left or Masculinist Left.   I have met a few feminists who were reasonable. These were all third wave sex-positive intersectional feminists.   Anyway, what is there to have common ground about in the first place? Why would they go along with any of our ideas?  I never had any luck framing it as, ""Hey this helps women too!"" Their attitude was just, ""Piss off!"" Most of the feminists I had contact with were 2nd Wave radical feminists, and boy, do they hate men! They're so full of hate there's no way we could work with them at all.  One thing that might be productive is reducing toxic masculinity. Now, most critiques of this are critiques of masculinity per se. But there is a type of masculinity that goes too far. The problem is toxic masculinity is enforced by women. It's the only thing they will accept in a man.   For instance, most men think I measure up in terms of masculinity, but boy, women sure don't! Most men are, ""You walk the walk and talk the talk, and you're in.""   We would have to condition women to stop demanding hypermasculinity from men. Would they do that though?    The issue could be framed that hypermasculinity and toxic masculinity is not just bad for men, but obviously it's very bad for women too. The problem here is that women are demanding something that is very harmful to them.   But it won't be the first time. They're driven by their emotions in life, and they don't think about consequences too much. They just go in whatever direction their emotions are dragging them, like a dog on a leash, at the moment.  If you have any luck making alliance with feminists on any issues, let me know. I don't really deal with feminists much anymore."

I would argue that the only difference between the sexes are the range of emotions that one is expected to have by society at large (At least in the West). I have found that women tend to have a lot more wiggle room in the emotions realm while males are conditioned to only express 4: Anger, horniness (Yes it's an emotion), jealousy, and joy.   Finally, I think that you are sort of speaking in absolutes about women where you could probably benefit from a little more nuance. For example, I have found that there are many women who prefer the stereotypical ""Beta male"" especially in long-term mates.   That being said, it does seem that women enforce strict gender norms for males with their mate preferences and child rearing practices. This is obviously a problem and masculinism cannot combat this as we are already viewed as a hate ideology by most of western society. Any criticism of women's role in enforcing traditional gender roles probably wouldn't be taken well. Im not sure how to fix this one since there are a lot of extreme elements within the movement and the media is determined to only portray this aspect of MRA.   Admittedly, this is one of the main areas where I'm stuck in this hypothetical conversation with my friends. Maybe frame it as ""internalized-misogyny""???"

mhandanna,2020-07-14 21:50:54,fy2xwjl,t3_gvme6g,t1_fstl5hw,"[https://youtu.be/3WMuzhQXJoY](https://youtu.be/3WMuzhQXJoY)  ***TRANSCRIPT:***  In 2013, I decided to meet my enemies. I was a 27-year-old, award-winning documentary filmmaker and a proud feminist. And I was determined to expose the dark underbelly of the men's rights movement. **At that point, all I knew of the men's rights movement was from what I'd read online, that it's a misogynistic hate group actively working against women's equality. Well, the vast majority of my previous work was about women's issues.** I directed documentaries about reproductive rights, single motherhood, and the need for more girls to get into STEM education. So when I learned that no one had ever documented the men's rights movement in a film before, I saw it as an opportunity to continue fighting for women's equality by exposing those preventing it. So for one year, I traveled North America meeting the leaders and followers of the men's rights movement. I spent anywhere from two hours up to eight hours, interviewing each individual men's rights activist, also known as MRA, and I filmed 44 people total. And there is an important rule in documentary filmmaking. As an interviewer, you do not interrupt.  So I'm asking questions, and I'm getting their full life story. And in the moment, **I didn't realize it, but now looking back I can see, that while I was conducting my interviews, I wasn't actually listening. I was hearing them speak, and I knew the cameras were recording, but in those moments of sitting across from my enemy, I wasn't listening. What was I doing? I was anticipating. I was waiting to hear a sentence, or even just a couple of words in succession that proved what I wanted to believe: that I had found the misogynist.** The ground zero of the war on women. A couple of times, I thought I had it. There was one men's rights activist that said to me, ""Just walk outside and look around, everything you see was built by a man."" Oh! That statement felt anti-women. I felt my jaw clench, but I sat quietly, as a documentarian should, while removing all the space between my upper and lower molars. (Laughter)  After my year of filming, I was reviewing the 100 hours of footage I had gathered, replaying and transcribing it, which believe me when I say no one will ever listen to you more than someone who transcribes your words. You should write that down. (Laughter) So, I was typing out every word meticulously, and through that process, I **began to realize that my initial knee-jerk reactions to certain statements weren't really warranted, and my feeling offended did not hold up to intense scrutiny.** Was that statement about men having built the skyscrapers and the bridges anti-women? I thought, well, what would be the gender-reverse scenario? Maybe a feminist saying: Just look around, everyone you see was birthed by a woman. Wow! That's a powerful statement. And it's true. Is it anti-male? I don't think so. I think it's acknowledging our unique and valued contributions to our society. Well, luckily, while I was making The Red Pill movie, I kept a video diary which ended up tracking my evolving views, and in looking back on the 37 diaries I recorded that year, there was a common theme.  # I would often hear an innocent, valid point that a men's rights activist would make, but in my head, I would add on to their statements, a sexist or anti-woman spin, assuming that's what they wanted to say but didn't...  ...So here are two examples of how that would go. A men's rights activist, an MRA, would say to me, ""There are over 2,000 domestic violence shelters for women in the United States. But only one for men. Yet, multiple reputable studies show that men are just as likely to be abused."" **I would hear them say,** ""We don't need 2,000 shelters for women. They're all lying about being abused. It's all a scam."" **But in looking back on all the footages I've gathered of men's rights activists talking about shelters and all the blogs they've written and the video live-streams they have posted on YouTube, they are not trying to defund women's shelters. Not at all. All they're saying is that men can be abused too, and they deserve care and compassion.**  Second example. A men's rights activist would say to me, ""Where is justice for the man who was falsely accused of raping a woman, and because of this accusation, he loses his college scholarship and is branded with the inescapable title of a rapist."" **I would hear them say,** ""A woman being raped isn't a big deal."" It's as if I didn't hear the word ""falsely"" accused of rape. All I heard was, ""He was accused of rape."" Of course, rape is a big deal, and all the men's rights activists I met agreed it is a horrible thing to have happened to anyone.  #"
mhandanna,2020-07-14 21:51:06,fy2xxg9,t3_gvme6g,t1_fy2xwjl,"# I eventually realized what they are saying is they are trying to add to the gender equality discussion,  who is standing up for the good-hearted, honorable man that loses his scholarship, his job, or worse yet, his children, because he is accused of something he absolutely did not do? (Sighs) Well, I couldn't keep denying the points they were making.  # There are real issues. But in my effort to avoid agreeing with my enemy completely, I changed from putting words in their mouth to acknowledging the issue but insisting they are women's issues...  ...So here are two examples of how that would go. A men's rights activist would say to me, ""Men are far more likely to lose their child in a custody battle."" And I would counter: ""Well, because women are unfairly expected to be the caretaker. It's discrimination against women that women get custody more often."" Yes. (Laughter) I am not proud of that. (Laughter)  Second example. An MRA would say to me, ""Men are roughly 78% of all suicides throughout the world."" And I would counter with: ""But women attempt suicide more often. So ha! (Laughter) Ha?  # It's not a contest. But I kept making it into one. Why couldn't I simply learn about men's issues and have compassion for male victims without jumping at the opportunity to insist that women are the real victims...  ...Well, after years of researching and fact-checking, what the men's rights activists were telling me, there is no denying that there are many human rights issues that disproportionately or uniquely affect men. Paternity fraud uniquely affects men. The United States Selective Service in the case of a draft still uniquely affects men. Workplace deaths: disproportionately men. War deaths: overwhelmingly men. Suicide: overwhelmingly men. Sentencing disparity, life expectancy, child custody, child support, false rape allegations, criminal court bias, misandry, failure launched, boys falling behind in education, homelessness, veterans issues, infant male genital mutilation, lack of parental choice once a child is conceived, lack of resources for male victims of domestic violence, so many issues that are heartbreaking, if you are the victim or you love someone who is the victim unto any one of these issues.  These are men's issues. **And most people can't name one because they think, ""Well, men have all their rights; they have all the power and privilege.""** But these issues deserve to be acknowledged. They deserve care, attention, and motivation for solutions. **Before making The Red Pill movie, I was a feminist of about ten years, and I thought I was well-versed on gender equality issues. But it wasn't until I met men's rights activists that I finally started to consider the other side of the gender equality equation.** It doesn't mean I agree with all that they've said. But I saw the immense value in listening to them and trying to see the world through their eyes. I thought if I could get my audience to also listen to them, it could serve as a rung on the ladder, bringing us all up to a higher consciousness about gender equality. So in October 2016, the film was released in theaters, and articles and critic reviews started to roll in.  # And that's when I experienced how engaged the media is in group think around gender politics. And I learned a difficult lesson...  ...When you start to humanize your enemy, you, in turn, may be dehumanized by your community. And that's what happened to me.  # Rather than debating the merit of the issues addressed in the film...  ...I became the target of a smear campaign, and people who had never seen the movie protested outside the theater doors, chanting that it was harmful to women. It certainly is not.  # But I understand their mindset...  # If I never made this movie, and I heard that there was a documentary screening about men's rights activists that didn't show them as monsters, I too would have protested the screenings or at least sign the petitions to ban the film because I was told that they were my enemy. I was told that men's rights activists were against women's equality. But all the men's rights activists I met support women's rights and are simply asking the question: ""Why doesn't our society care about men's rights?"" Well, the greatest challenge I faced through this whole process, it wasn't the protests against my film, and it wasn't how I was treated by the mainstream media - even though it got pretty disgusting at times. The greatest challenge I faced was peeling back the layers of my own bias.  It turns out I did meet my enemy while filming. It was my ego saying that I was right, and they were subhuman. It's no secret now that I no longer call myself a feminist, but I must clarify I am not anti-feminist, and I am not a men's rights activist. I still support women's rights, and I now care about men's rights as well. However, I believe if we want to honestly discuss gender equality, we need to invite all voices to the table. Yet, this is not what is happening. Men's groups are continually vilified, falsely referred to as hate groups, and their voices are systematically silenced. Do I think either movement has all the answers? No. Men's rights activists are not without flaws, neither are feminists. But if one group is being silenced, that's a problem for all of us. If I could give advice to anyone in our society at large, we have to stop expecting to be offended, and we have to start truly, openly, and sincerely listening. That would lead to a greater understanding of ourselves and others, having compassion for one another, working together towards solutions because we all are in this together. And once we do that, we can finally heal from the inside out. But it has to start with listening. Thank you for listening."

My only real problem with feminism, and this causes all its other problems, is that it is a pure idealogy... yes there are myriad types... intersectional, liberal, leftist, radical, and so on.... they are all idealogies and underpinned bu theory of patriarchy... being idealogical most of the actions feminism takes are highly ineffective, they sell a tonne of books, make loads of noise, but are highly ineffective as they get the root cause wrong always, instead of being a scientists and looking at things through data and reason.... its like seeing the problem of obesity in society and saying the cause is racism, lets pump $2 billion into fighting racism and that will cure obesity.  A tiny example is vaccination rates in Africa, with men having a lower rate of uptake... feminsts could spend 20 years talking about toxic mascuinty, patriarchy, gender roles and emotional labour of women, and how women take on the burden of health blah blah blah 20 years of bullshit.... when anyone with a brain sorts it out in 5 mins... OK so men lower rates. whats the data? Ahhh so men aren't there were we are adverstising... ahh men striggle to take time of work... OK so hwo about we advertise in spaces where men are... who are men influenced by? Ahh we can advertise with famous sports people..... BOOM problem solved practical solutions.... feminists will be stuck on this for 20 years.  Same with domestic violence, FGM, rape, violence.... feminsits have completely fucked it up....  how far down the rabbit hole do you wanna go? Heres a DV professor talk about what feminsit did to DV:  [https://youtu.be/e9JfXs5QSfo](https://youtu.be/e9JfXs5QSfo)  Patriachy theory? Modern day p theory came from legenday feminst Kate Millet, yes it had some history from Seneca Falls and stolen from marxism but mainly Millet and a few others.... boy oh boy, do you want to know what Kate Millets own sister has to say about Kate Millet and how mentally disturbed she was (video below), just like Dworkin, Mackinon and Solanas all highky influential in shaping all of modern feminism and they were all highliy distrubed.
