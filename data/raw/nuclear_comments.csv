Bananawamajama,2019-12-19 20:59:14,fbemqyc,t3_ecybtl,t3_ecybtl,"Odd statement considering the recent fight over including nuclear in the EU clean energy heirarchy.  I couldnt read the full article, but unless theres actually some kind of proposal to turn back that decision being offered in the statement I dont really get it."
greg_barton,2019-12-19 21:03:06,fben3wr,t3_ecybtl,t1_fbemqyc,"They might be trying to play both sides.  The tide is turning on the realization that nuclear is necessary.  Germany's stance could morph to, ""Yeah, we should have kept nuclear, but now it's too late"" in order to try and keep popularity with as many people as possible."
deadhand-,2019-12-19 21:18:25,fbeok1d,t3_ecybtl,t1_fben3wr,"Now would be a nice time for them to say ""Well, the old reactors were too dangerous, but we're going to pile in a ton of cash into advanced reactors which will be safer in case intermittent RE + storage doesn't work out"".        Even though the notion of the old reactors being too dangerous is fairly bullshit, it would give them a way to save face in the longer term."
greg_barton,2019-12-19 21:27:03,fbepcrz,t3_ecybtl,t1_fbeok1d,"Sure would be great, but the cynic in me doubts it will happen.  Why would Russian interests want Germany to develop advanced nuclear?  They want to sell them natural gas, then if nuclear in in the picture develop it themselves, sell it to the rest of the world, and extend their influence."
StardustSapien,2019-12-19 22:41:15,fbew0jc,t3_ecybtl,t1_fbepcrz,"Forgive me, but why would *Germany* of all countries pick this particular time and circumstance to placate the Russians and defer to their interest?  If anything, checking the Russians, both economically and geo-politically, would be the *BEST* reason for Germany to get back on the nuclear band wagon.  With Trump burning the bridge across the pond, the Brits crashing out of the EU, and the disturbing rise in nationalism across the rest of Europe, surely Berlin should more seriously consider they need to steer toward a future with more independence and less susceptibility to foreign pressures?"

MiserableFungi,2019-12-20 05:05:05,fbfr7yr,t3_ecybtl,t1_fbewfv7,"I do not think your citations demonstrates what you intend.  From your first link:  &gt;In 2017, Russia nominated Schröder to also serve as an independent director of the board of its biggest oil producer Rosneft..... His decision caused an outcry in Germany and abroad, especially in a climate of fear about any potential Russian interference in the 2017 German elections.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel criticized her predecessor, saying ""I do not think what Mr Schröder is doing is okay"".  From your second link:  &gt;... it has been noted that the gas supplies by Russia can be used as a political tool. A Swedish Defence Research Agency study, finished in March 2007, counted over 55 incidents since 1991, most with ""both political and economic underpinnings""....In January 2018, United States Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that the U.S. and Poland oppose the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. They see it as undermining Europe's overall energy security and stability.  There is no denying Russian gas is a big deal for Europe.  But no one is rolling over and showing their bellies to Moscow.  There is plenty of both awareness and resistance to Russia's ambitions to strongarm Europe by leveraging the economics of energy."
greg_barton,2019-12-20 06:54:45,fbfxpc9,t3_ecybtl,t1_fbfr7yr,"Yes, they’re fully aware of what they’re doing, yet doing it anyway.  When they shut down coal and nuclear then natural gas will be the last supplier of dependable energy.  And Russia owns it. So Russia will own them."
MoonLightBird,2019-12-20 10:22:37,fbg6s30,t3_ecybtl,t1_fbejo6d,"Merkel's party (CDU, alongside their Bavarian-only sister-party CSU) is not consistent in this matter. I wouldn't go as far as to say ""the party is divided"", but you do have individuals and groups within the party who are at least thinking out loud that ""nuclear exit"" wasn't the best idea, and you have others who reject to even dispute the issue, which politically is considered long done and dusted. Merkel is in the latter camp."
MoonLightBird,2019-12-20 10:38:49,fbg7g43,t3_ecybtl,t1_fbemqyc,"&gt;unless theres actually some kind of proposal to turn back that decision being offered in the statement I dont really get it  There's no such proposal. And if there was, it would have next to no chance of becoming law, considering the current makeup of parliament (even most of CDU/CSU wouldn't support it I reckon, let alone getting their coalition partner SPD on board). And if it became law, the utility corporations who own and run the 7 remaining NPPs (all slated to be closed within the next 3 years already!) have repeatedly stated that they're not even interested in a reversal of the forced shut-down. It's all long since been planned, they're ready to close and demolish the plants, and understandably have little faith in yet another change of mind on politics' side.  This is just *some* people (without backing from their party at large) thinking out loud, saying ""we coulda-shoulda-woulda"", and floating the idea that having the NPPs at least run some longer would be a good idea... but realistically, it's not going to happen.  Still good, tho. You've got to start *somewhere*, and publicly stating that nuclear energy is a worthwhile option to keep is one small step in the right direction to slooowly change the anti-nuclear narrative that is astonishingly prevalent in Germany."
spacedog_at_home,2019-12-20 14:12:19,fbgjexk,t3_ecybtl,t1_fbg7g43,Thanks for the insight.  It is probably for the best that they close them and the renewables can fail so hard that no one else would ever want to follow suit.
Engineer-Poet,2019-12-20 16:02:48,fbgsthl,t3_ecybtl,t1_fbejo6d,"It's not the government, it's the CDU energy spokesman Joachim Pfeiffer.&amp;nbsp; It's an ideological post, yet he's thrown the Energiewende under the bus in favor of reality.  I would not be the least bit surprised if this is a trial balloon to see how the issue would play in the next election.&amp;nbsp; If it gets strong support or if Green opposition is weak due to utility bill fatigue, look for a pivot to a pro-nuclear position.&amp;nbsp; Merkel is retiring anyway so she won't have to face charges of hypocrisy."

I doubt that.&amp;nbsp; Utility bills are hurting NOW.&amp;nbsp; Going back and e.g. turning the shut-but-not-dismantled plants back on would immediately cut gas imports and electric prices, and be a huge coup for the pol who made it happen."

greg_barton,2019-12-20 16:08:38,fbgtc5m,t3_ecybtl,t1_fbgsthl,"I wouldn't be surprised at a trial balloon either.  The greens were outvoted in the EU parliament recently, so maybe they're afraid of losing influence by continuing an anti-nuclear path.  But I don't expect the anti-nukes to give up for a long, long time, a generation at least."
greg_barton,2019-12-20 16:25:17,fbguv2w,t3_ecybtl,t1_fbgjexk,"That's basically the way I see Germany, and have for the last few years.  They're an exemplar for ideological driven failure."
deadhand-,2019-12-20 16:25:44,fbguwjd,t3_ecybtl,t1_fbgt2yu,"Well, they could, and probably should, but supporting advanced reactor research wouldn't necessarily be politically 'incompatible' with their current actions. They could just dramatize the differences in safety / O&amp;M costs / load following capabilities / etc. between Gen 2 and Gen 4 designs, and call it a backup plan."
Tobware,2020-01-06 18:18:23,fdeae8p,t3_ekx8h8,t3_ekx8h8,"The basics, son!  Water is an excellent radiation shield, dumping the reactor undersea will result in minimal environmental contamination.  For examples see how we stock spent nuclear rods."
TheGaussianMan,2020-01-06 18:23:20,fdeav4l,t3_ekx8h8,t1_fdeae8p,"That's what I figured, but I'd like some good research to reference for environmental impact. What happens in shallow waters? What happens in salt water? Could a strong current bring enough radioactive material to a heavy fishing area? I want to be relatively thorough."
greg_barton,2020-01-06 18:25:35,fdeb2yh,t3_ekx8h8,t3_ekx8h8,"&gt;I'm having a little trouble finding any papers on how a meltdown at sea might affect the environment and human safety.  Maybe because it really won't.  There's literally [billions of tons](https://imgur.com/a/lXEfdTZ) of uranium dissolved in the oceans right now, dissolved from the Earth's crust.  There's even more radioactive potassium.  A meltdown of a nuclear reactor isn't going to affect radiation levels significantly."
dyyret,2020-01-06 18:28:42,fdebdsf,t3_ekx8h8,t1_fdeav4l,"https://thebarentsobserver.com/en/ecology/2019/07/komsomolets-leaks-radioactivity-see-unique-video  &gt; What we have measured has very little impact on Norwegian fish and seafood. Levels [of radioactivity] in the Norwegian Sea are in general very low, and the pollution from “Komsomolets“ is quickly diluted to harmless levels because the wreak is at such deep water,” Hilde Elise Heldal says.  This is about a russian nuclear submarine with a 190 MW reactor that sunk in the Norwegian sea. This is on deep water though."
TheGaussianMan,2020-01-06 18:28:43,fdebdtl,t3_ekx8h8,t1_fdeb2yh,At this point that would be relatively well mixed correct? Would there be any concern that a much higher concentration could exist around the reactor that could affect wildlife in say shallow waters?
TheGaussianMan,2020-01-06 18:30:18,fdebjb6,t3_ekx8h8,t1_fdebdsf,Theres the more recent kursk that is sitting at something like 108 meters much closer to fishing. I might try and find a report on that.
dyyret,2020-01-06 18:31:19,fdebms5,t3_ekx8h8,t1_fdebjb6,"You have this report on k-159, sitting at 250m depth as well.  https://www.dsa.no/publikasjon/straalevernrapport-2017-12-radiological-impact-assessment-for-hypothetical-accident-scenarios-involving-the-russian-nuclear-submarine-k-159.pdf"
TheGaussianMan,2020-01-06 18:34:22,fdebx80,t3_ekx8h8,t1_fdebms5,"Excellent, thank you!"
zolikk,2020-01-06 18:56:08,fdee0kp,t3_ekx8h8,t1_fdebdtl,"Depends on what the meltdown entails. Keep in mind a meltdown just means the fuel assembly inside the core melted. Obviously the reactor is no longer usable but there doesn't have to be any externally noticeable effect otherwise. Also, naval reactors have a smaller thermal output per volume, thus also a smaller decay heat level, so if the meltdown were supposed to be caused by lack of active cooling after shutdown, it's far less likely to actually melt down because there's not enough heat generation, and some passive convection in the vessel is more than enough to keep it cool. If you also lose coolant from the vessel though, then it can melt down."
TheGaussianMan,2020-01-06 19:06:09,fdeez5t,t3_ekx8h8,t1_fdee0kp,"I was thinking of worse case scenario where either the ship is entirely inverted or there is a catastrophic loss of cooling. If material were to melt through the containment or if the containment were to be ruptured, what is the effect of that material in the environment?"
zolikk,2020-01-06 19:40:50,fdeicew,t3_ekx8h8,t1_fdeez5t,"Well I figure it again depends a lot on what kind of fuel it is, but if it's uranium oxide I expect the corium material, when entering water, just cools down and solidifies again. Then the corium will settle in chunks on the ocean floor. Anything that goes close to it, say under a meter or so, will get irradiated. Since it's also a source of heat I'd expect some lifeforms to seek it out like they would a hydrothermal vent, but I don't think anything would actually survive in contact with it for long. By the time it becomes less radioactive it also stops emitting heat so it will just be a rock on the ocean floor I suppose. Might get buried by dirt eventually.  Since there's some elements such as cesium inside that are water soluble, I suppose some of them will end up carried away by the water, but if the fuel is an oxide then the cesium inside actually has a hard time getting out.  Some cesium in the water also isn't of much concern because of the self-shielding of water as well as the three dimensional dispersal. During an atmospheric release the reason why radiation levels can increase significantly is because all the radioactive dust settles on the ground, thus becoming concentrated into two dimensions (plus air doesn't absorb the gammas). If it stays dispersed in three dimensions, the density of radioactive atoms is significantly lower, similar to a radioactive gas released into atmosphere, which doesn't cause radioactivity levels to significantly increase.  Cesium has been shown to bioaccumulate in fish, but it's detectable at very low levels and these levels don't actually do anything to the animals other than being measurable."
Sinborn,2020-01-06 20:17:51,fdem110,t3_ekx8h8,t3_ekx8h8,You should look into the US Navy's use and track record of safety using nuclear powered ships.  The disconnect between the public view of nuclear vs. the Navy is beyond absurd.
TheGaussianMan,2020-01-06 20:33:57,fdennyo,t3_ekx8h8,t1_fdem110,"Actually the reason I'm writing this is in response to some folks on r/engineering scoffing at the idea of nuclear merchant shipping. I had mentioned that the us navy had a very good track record, but they said that didnt matter.   I feel like making the case for it comes to a few things. As far as safety is concerned, size of the reactor, abundance of cooling water available, track record of private companies running nuclear power, and low likelihood of contamination affecting anything in the ocean are key pieces to research. Effectively, I want to be able to say that a shipping company would run a nuclear reactor safely/it would be inconsequential even if something catastrophic occurred."
Sinborn,2020-01-06 20:56:17,fdepyle,t3_ekx8h8,t1_fdennyo,"People are damn near religious with their anti- nuclear beliefs.  Changing their mind is akin to deprogramming a zealot.  The US has ran nuclear powered ships since 1953 with zero problems relating to the power plants.  Two sunken ships, neither cause of the power plant.  The Soviets had a lot more issues but we all know about their safety record with nuclear."
TheGaussianMan,2020-01-06 21:16:08,fderyz2,t3_ekx8h8,t1_fdepyle,"I expect it with the general population, but I was very saddened to see it from engineers. My hope is that engineers will be more willing to listen with a well supported argument.  As far as the Soviets go, I imagine this is where people will go ""see not everyone can be trusted."" My argument then is that even if a ship had a massive failure, the small size of marine reactor and the ocean itself would mitigate any large scale disaster. The other argument is that while a nuclear accident could happen, pollution from liquid natural gas and diesel happen every time a cargo ship is underway."
Sinborn,2020-01-06 21:19:28,fdesb2k,t3_ekx8h8,t1_fderyz2,Yeah no one can name a single sunken Soviet nuclear sub because they are no risk.
cowboylasers,2020-01-06 23:14:14,fdf3he5,t3_ekx8h8,t1_fderyz2,Not everyone (probably not even most) in that thread are engineers and few engineers know much about nuclear energy. I doubt even a well supported argument will do well over there.
Kashyyk,2020-01-07 01:21:05,fdfevpz,t3_ekx8h8,t1_fdebjb6,"The Kursk was salvaged, the only thing left on the sea floor was part of the bow. The Russians blew it up though so now it’s many parts of the bow."
EqualDraft0,2020-01-07 01:29:57,fdffo5o,t3_ekx8h8,t3_ekx8h8,"Others have pointed out that it wouldn’t really matter, but with a properly designed reactor it should be basically impossible. Such a reactor would be floating in an endless supply of water, which can absorb insane amounts of heat. There would be no reason to design a reactor such that it can even have a meltdown surrounded by so much cooling capacity."
TheCultofAbeLincoln,2020-01-07 01:32:17,fdffvno,t3_ekx8h8,t3_ekx8h8,"Navy reactors use weapons-grade uranium due to the size constraints. Something to consider.  Plus the Navy has a comparably limitless budget for their mission (in this case, making sure subs never have to surface and carriers can stay at sea forever). A massive training program (think multiple bases with schools and prototype reactors) plus Navy and Civilian teams around the country to perform inspections and training, plus several hundred sailors in Reactor Department on each carrier.  I imagine the scoffing is mainly because it doesn't seem economical when you can build literally dozens ships and fuel them for the cost of creating a new class and building 1 nuke boat. Especially when there is no need to keep them at sea for months at a time.   But hey who thought private spaceflight would be a real thing."
TheGaussianMan,2020-01-07 03:41:12,fdfrkbl,t3_ekx8h8,t1_fdffvno,"Yes the logistics of putting together crews for merchant nuclear ships hurt the NS Savanah. It would definitely require incentives to make the switch happen, but I'm curious to see if it would be cheaper. As diesel and liquid natural gas become more expensive, it makes the nuclear option seem more economically friendly. Theres also the question of how long does it take to refuel. Also, which system would offer a lower weight?   I was under the impression that they use 90+% enriched to save on space and weight. This is certainly a proliferation issue, but would a merchant ship need the same requirements? A cargo ship doesnt need to be as fast or small (or at least I dont think so).   The question is real enough that several recent studies have been put together. As climate change becomes a very real crisis, reducing the environmental impact of cargo shipping could be huge."
TheGaussianMan,2020-01-07 03:42:12,fdfrnlf,t3_ekx8h8,t1_fdfevpz,Was the reason environmental or did they not want others to spy on it?
Kashyyk,2020-01-07 04:09:10,fdftyp9,t3_ekx8h8,t1_fdfrnlf,"They salvaged the sub to recover the sailors, and blew up the bow because there were torpedoes that couldn’t be recovered from it and they didn’t want other countries going down and taking a look at them."

whatisnuclear,2020-01-07 16:56:06,fdh62vn,t3_ekx8h8,t1_fdfrkbl,"You can get a 5-year core from low enriched uranium that would take 1-2 months to refuel, possibly much less. But you'd have to refuel in a nuclear capable home port.  I'm super glad you're looking into this because I think nuclear powered merchant shipping is a fantastic idea.   As you probably know, the one nuclear merchant ship we have today is forbidden from most ports. So you'll need to either won lots of hearts and minds (yes please) or make it a nuclear powered high-seas tubboat that stays 5km out of each port call while conventional ships come grab the load. This may make sense anyway for economics because the nuclear ship can just drop off and grab a staged new load and be underway basically all the time. No point sitting at port getting unloaded when you have a nuclear engine."
TheGaussianMan,2020-01-07 20:10:33,fdhpxbz,t3_ekx8h8,t1_fdh62vn,"Luckily I'm not the only one who still thinks it's a great idea. Theres a number of recent reports from a group and their insurance company on what that ship and power plant would look like along with who is responsible for what. There is one interesting thing though, I need to read more, but it seems like they chose a lead bismuth eutectic cooled reactor. Is there any reason they wouldnt just use water, considering it would allow for emergency use of sea water?  I think it's less convincing people to let that happen and more convincing large shipping companies that it'll save them money. If you can make that argument, they'll get the legislation passed.  Is there a merchant ship still operating? And I also happen to live where the Savannah is. That was pretty neat learning about it to find that I live a walk away."
StardustSapien,2020-01-07 22:47:35,fdi7rkc,t3_ekx8h8,t1_fdeb2yh,"&gt; There's literally billions of tons of uranium dissolved in the oceans right now, dissolved from the Earth's crust.   That's a little off base in the context of OP's question isn't it?  I mean, all that dissolved uranium doesn't bother anyone for the same reason freshly manufactured uranium fuel pellets can be handled safely without any shielding.  OP is asking about a meltdown scenario, so it would be more comparable to a Chernobyl or Fukushima spilling its guts of now-irradiated fuel along with fission products and transuranics into the water.  IRL, nothing like that, not even the worst accidents experienced by the Soviet/Russian Navy, has ever approached that level of clusterfuck, though.  So the chance of OP's hypothetical would be slim.  I would make the case that it would also be low impact because as Fukushima demonstrates, even if nuclear contamination *is* released into the greater marine environment, the vast size of the ocean safely dilutes it to the point of trivialness.  Coupled with the short half lives of much of the contaminants, it really is a non-issue.  I hope its clear I'm not being critical of the positions being staked.  But I felt it necessary to make a better argument that more directly addressed the most pertinent issue."
StardustSapien,2020-01-07 22:52:42,fdi8d7g,t3_ekx8h8,t1_fdh2ao7,"Keep in mind also that commercial nuclear naval propulsion didn't take off for reasons more political and economic that had nothing to do with (actual) safety.  It might interest you to know that the ship itself, after its (very short almost non-existent) cargo hauling days were over (it was also built to accommodate passengers, but never really carried any either), was actually docked somewhere near Panama were its nuclear reactor's remaining usefulness provided power for use on land.  Oh the irony.  I'm not as knowledgeable on the subject, but it might also be useful for you to look into the safety record of the small fleet of nuclear powered icebreakers, which as far as I know, also have excellent safety records.  At least when it comes to nuclear."

If you mean [this Lazard report,](https://www.lazard.com/perspective/lcoe2019) you are the victim of (much less than) half-truths.&amp;nbsp; The maximum storage duration analyzed is 4 hours (50 MW/200 MWh).&amp;nbsp; This will suffice to carry e.g. PV from a sunny day through the evening demand peak, but that's all.&amp;nbsp; If you have a cloudy day, you're screwed.&amp;nbsp; If you have a week-long calm spell in winter north of 40 degrees latitude you're REALLY screwed, and those spells are anything but uncommon.&amp;nbsp; And you still need something to carry the grid through the night.  When a nuclear plant restarts after refueling, it is typically good for at least 17 months.&amp;nbsp; 17 months of storage wouldn't even be enough to run California on ""renewables"", because its hydro goes through dry spells which literally last years.  If we're going to lick the GHG problem we need a state of near-continuous electric surplus.&amp;nbsp; Power above instantaneous demand can go to a host of different uses, such as making ammonia or plasma-gasifying garbage for synthetic fuels.&amp;nbsp; We're not going to get this with the feast-and-famine characteristics of the so-called ""renewables"", which can't even power the plants which manufacture them or make the steel and concrete which lets them be mounted.&amp;nbsp; Do the math.&amp;nbsp; They will fail, *and were meant to.*"

I wasn't agreeing or disagreeing with your arguments about the website, I took exception to your flippant comment about the nuclear industry as a whole and then your abandonment of fair play... which is never a good idea.. that's a two way street!  You should re-evaluate what the problems (plural) have been in the nuclear industry over the last couple decades. It's obviously not a single variable (especially not something as fantastic or dramatic as ""malicious, deliberate lies"" [unless you're talking about nuclear events through the prism of mainstream media, is this what you meant?]), it's a composite of independent and dependent factors that all coalesce to (negatively) impact construction and operating costs. Complex problems never reduce down to single causal variable unless you're reading a news headline, then magically, ""Voilà!"" x causes y.  As far as the website, i'm a bit ambivalent about it. What could it hurt to have the arguments side by side. Maybe it brings the anti-nukes and pro-nukes together in a clash that the rest of us can watch and piece together some kernels of truth.

I feel like Nuclear is on the verge of being completely cut out of the conversation, and that seems wrong to me.

Seems to be a lot conflicting information.  Okay last time. It is still banned?   1992. President G. H. W. Bush halted weapons reprocessing in a policy statement on nuclear nonproliferation declaring: “I have set forth today a set of principles to guide our nonproliferation efforts in the years ahead and directed a number of steps to supplement our existing efforts. These steps include a decision not to produce plutonium and highly enriched uranium for nuclear explosive purposes....”
xatlasmjpn,2020-06-08 02:24:20,ftbvqwq,t3_gymr7m,t1_ftbt582,"Reprocessing doesn't magically make the radioactive waste disappear. It's good for recovering plutonium for weapons use (original purpose of the technology) and for reducing the volume of waste, but the leftover waste (fission products and transuranics) is still radioactive. Even if we built fast reactors to use up the long-lived transuranics, the fission products will still take hundreds of years to fully decay off to acceptable levels. It's a couple orders of magnitude better than unprocessed spent fuel, but the anti-nukes will still complain.     The real reason reprocessing hasn't taken off in the US is that the demand for fuel has basically been flat for 30+ years (a bunch of nuclear projects got cancelled after TMI accident) so fuel prices remain low enough that it's not worth spending tens of billions of dollars to only save tens of millions per year. Other countries have pursued it for military or scientific reasons, but it will never catch on as a self-sustaining business because it's more expensive than storing fuel in a deep geological repository."

I don't think that's the takeaway, and you should not think like that, as you're just falling victim to the same tribalism mentality that way.  It's not wind or solar that's making these people come up with ridiculous anti-nuclear stories. It's their anti-nuclear beliefs and/or conflicts of interests and industry backers. Their arguments should be shot down but without similar emotional appeals that you see from them. Their wrong arguments and anti-nuclear attacks have no bearing on whether or not nuclear, wind and solar can be partners; that matter is up to simple objective facts and is debatable on its own merits.  Do not use these stories as fuel for an anti-wind or anti-solar stance. That just strengthens the polarization between the groups - they'll just similarly retort that your stance proves nuclear is inherently anti-wind or whatever and thus cannot be accepted."
DV82XL,2020-06-10 13:14:26,ftkz44o,t3_gzwq7e,t1_ftkv0xc,"I am replying to you out of courtesy only, as I no longer wish to participate in this sub. I would rather not start a conversation on this matter with you.  There is no good technical or economic reason to use any intermittent source if nuclear is available. None.  It just cannot be justified. Furthermore, both the wind and solar industries, and their masters, the natural gas industry is well aware of this fact.  They are not willing to give up their market for nuclear anymore than coal was in the past. They are not looking for accommodation and any attempt on nuclear’s part to do do so will be in vain. The attack in the link is proof of just that.   I am in my seventies. At one time I was deeply involved in the pronuclear fight, but I became discouraged because rather than trying to engage the public, my contemporaries tried to answer the manufactured concerns of the antinuclear side. Of course the only thing the other side did was raise the bar.   The nuclear industry kept chasing ALARA (look it up if you don't know) to the point of diminishing returns, driving expenses up. Every attempt to deal with spent fuel was blocked and then spent fuel was renamed by them ""nuclear waste"" and declared an unsolvable problem. Research reactors in the US derated because of some fantasy that some terrorist would steal the hot core and make a bomb, a notion so ludicrous it was breathtaking, happened nevertheless. And so on, and so on.  The other side doesn't play fair, nor should we. They have gone to the public with their lies, we need to go to the public without worrying that some cannot be reached. But guaranteed, the higher utility bills many are paying for the wind and solar fraud does give us a powerful argument. The LCOE of wind and solar is being reported as artificially low, and that for nuclear artificially high. These are the arguments we should be using.  You have to know your enemy, and like it or not, that is what wind and solar are to nuclear."
zolikk,2020-06-10 13:27:58,ftl0hrv,t3_gzwq7e,t1_ftkz44o,"I do not wish to get into a deep discussion on this either, especially since you'd find I agree with you on most matters you brought up re: intermittency, economics, the artificially guided public perception of nuclear and what's keeping nuclear from competing.  My point was simply an appeal to keep logical consistency in arguments, as much as possible. Otherwise you will not be able to convince those that are of a same opinion but could still potentially be convinced (not referring to fanatics &amp; believers).  ""Anti-nuclear advocates use this spin against nuclear industry"" -&gt; ""This is why wind/solar cannot be partners with nuclear"" is logically broken. It is a ""does not follow"" type statement. It doesn't matter whether the conclusion statement is by itself, for other reasons, correct. Then you should be using those arguments before stating this conclusion.  I specifically mean this as a way to appeal to those that are in the middle and can be convinced. Not talking about ""respecting"" the anti-nuclear advocate.  Not having logically sound and structured arguments won't convince anyone. People may not know the background info that you or me have on this topic, but they usually recognize mistakes in arguments/logical fallacies. And if and when someone you're trying to convince spots such a thing in what you're saying, you've almost surely lost them. I mean generally speaking - but that's what matters if you wish to appeal to and convince as many people as possible, which is what fixing this problem will take."

That's what the other side has been doing, and why the nuclear side keeps failing to get the message out. Unless we are willing to get our hands dirty and take up those tactics too we will fail as we always have. Unfortunately, clearly given what I have seen here over the last two weeks, that still hasn't gotten through.  Your argument was used in the 80's and 90's - all we had to do was reason with everyone - and look where it has got us."

They will cling to alarmist arguments because it paradoxically gives stability to their subjective perspectives.  That's also why I don't think emotion-based pro-nuclear arguments will ever be successful. It's nowhere near as effective to emotionally appeal to *not* be deathly afraid of something than it is to do the opposite.  Unfortunately the only way I see this resolved is that eventually nuclear will be necessary. Once the climate is much worse, life is harder, and/or fossil fuels are less economical, nuclear will at one point be the only option left.  Above anything else humans want to keep their quality of life at least stable. Nuclear will be required for that. And begrudgingly or not, based on their fears, they'll still use it. And then in time culture can learn that fears were all bullshit in the past.  But this all takes time. How much... I don't know."

TMI is even a fantastic example of how safe nuclear accidents can be. Like, nothing happened, no one got cancer, no one died (AFAIK). It should be seen as a success. Fukushima was a crazy example of why safety advice should never be ignored. Chernobyl is literally impossible in modern plants. If you understand the context and impacts of the accidents, and compare them to the impacts of accidents and operation of all other sources of power, then nuclear power is an obvious win.  Unfortunately, science is hard. We just have to keep communicating!"

Hyperbole aside, I want to inject some numbers into this for our collective perspective.   Three Mile Island literally killed nobody.   Chernobyl directly killed 31 and shortened the lives of around 4,000 people. Fukushima killed 1, with differing estimates on attributable deaths (remember, this was in the midst of a natural disaster that killed almost 16,000 people, but people forget those deaths).   Even if we [take the highest numbers that estimate more than six times the WHO's estimates](https://ourworldindata.org/what-was-the-death-toll-from-chernobyl-and-fukushima ""It is hard to do this seriously.""), and say it killed 60,000 people, and say Fukushima killed around 1,600 people, in large part due to the stress of having to evacuate the area, and then on top of this just round these estimates up to 100,000 people killed from nuclear energy *ever* to include anything I may have missed according to detractors and ensure the estimate definitely encompasses all deaths from nuclear power even if its a massive overestimate.   That still doesn't match up with the people that die from fossil fuel particulate that is killing an order of magnitude more two million people ***each year***. Oh wait, I meant [over 2.1 million yearly](http://www.iop.org/news/13/jul/page_60518.html ""This is the part where I get to legally mug the anti-nuclear protestor for slander.""). That rounding is *yearly* larger than all nuclear power related deaths *ever*.   And that doesn't cover mining and fracking deaths. The last decade has killed over 200 coal miners in the US, and since 1900, there have been [104,890 deaths from coal mining in the US alone](https://arlweb.msha.gov/stats/centurystats/coalstats.asp ""And this is just coal... just in the US... just since 1900.""). There are still modern major mining accidents, including [the Soma Mine disaster back in 2014 that killed 301 miners](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32709431 ""I'm not making a full list of these, they're too common."").

Remember that they also tend to be uneducated, so keep the message simple. Technicalities are to be avoided at first. Remember, this is a also a strata that tends to believe conspiracy theories (since that gives a little bit of meaning and sense of control to their often tumultuous and haphazard lives).   For young tech heads, appeal to their confidence in the power of technology. Nuclear is a mythos to them, stories from an age of wonder (Apollo references are welcome :P ) snuffed out through neglect by their elders and general ignorance. They'll listen to technological arguments, since they be used to them to a far greater extent than previous generations (have you ever seen them rattle performance values for Iphones?). Also, appeal to their confort. They value reliability, since anyone at or under 30 years of age has lived through a real rollercoaster in terms of the economy. ""On with a flick of a switch"" would be a good motto. Money only if they ask.  For environmentalists, well, it depends. These people are from very varied backgrounds, ranging from managers who decided they wanted more forestry, to hippies who never grew out of the 70s. If they belong to the old Sierra School, than it'll be tricky. Appeal to younger, more idealistic members. Those will still be activists. The older ones are more along the lines of managers, they've gotten to a point where they can actually make money off their NGOs and activism. They'll have less incentive to stray from the line. The younger ones belong a generation that fears slowness, and do not want to still be marching in 30 years time. Results now. Face-to-face conferences work best (though that may simply be my own experience). INVITE them, give them a choice to participate. They are quite willing for debates.

macmaniac77,2020-06-13 18:54:24,fuq6nod,t3_h8a6qa,t3_h8a6qa,Fission can compete for as long as working products are produced. Scaling fusion reactor manufacturing might be even harder than getting substantially past break even. The faster we deploy nuclear energy dense power the less likely we will kill ourselves with pollution and overconsumption compared to recycling. MSR's should be manufactureable at large scale sooner than fusion is likely to be ready to scale.  The fields are complementary too since often the fission reactions will require large startup energy easily provided by fission. We will be better off working together to understand physics more completely.
Mr-Tucker,2020-06-13 19:44:08,fuqc9ke,t3_h8a6qa,t3_h8a6qa,"Fusion has energy density issues. Though there is no definitive evidence to look at (since we have yet to achieve breakeven) it looks like these plants will be veeery expensive to build for their power levels (hundreds of kWs up to MAYBE a GW). Lithium is already expensive and will need to be purified, the superconductors are finicky to work with (that coil geometry needs to be VERY precise) and not that cheap, and plasma density is low (though very energetic per kg). The materials also need to be researched, since the neutron spectrum is crazy hard compared to fission.  Fission showed that such complex engineering is not easy. And when people find out about these plants also producing radiation (neutron activation, since D-T is about all we can hope for in any useful term) you're gonna see a hell of a lot of opposition (helped by generous funding from fossil backers, ofcourse). Fission is here, has the best power density there is, and is a much better known and less finicky technology.  Even if fusion makes breakeven, that's just the first step. And the easiest, since all the issues are technological."

The cost of the reactor components, the difficulty controlling the reactor and the complexity involved with breeding tritium for use just don’t make for a cheap machine. Once we get to the point of pure deuterium fusion this may change, but now the reactor is even harder to build."

I'm 100% behind fission, in any form, being built right now, but the regulatory situation is brutal.  I'm not well-versed in fission reactor design, but the ARC reactor design essentially consists of component that can all be mass-produced (the HTS tapes are much more convenient than ITER-style or copper coils), assuming a few design points work out. A downside to fusion is that, since you're generating 14 MeV neutrons no matter the size of your reactor, you can't really make it small. Any commercial fusion reactor will be in the hundreds of MW range."
marinmersenne,2020-06-14 02:08:56,furfun1,t3_h8a6qa,t3_h8a6qa,"In my opinion, even if fusion can be made dense enough to be commercially viable, which I doubt will happen for quite some time, it seems to me that unless some revolutionary new fusion technology is discovered, the simplicity of a fission reactor will still outweigh the advantages of fusion.  When you think about it, molten salt fission reactors are essentially a big vat of self sustaining fuel salt whereas fusion is much more complex, requiring enormous expensive superconducting magnets, perfect vacuums etc.  Fission is more friendly to getting the heat out of the reactor, as the energy directly heats the dense fuel which can be easily removed through a simple heat exchanger, unlike fusion where you have to capture the radiant heat(x-rays etc) and high energy neutrons from the plasma, through the vacuum vessel.                                                                                                                       I imagine that this will necessitate periodic replacement of the vacuum vessel due to neutron damage, and neutron activation will probably make the primary coolant loop of a fusion reactor just as radioactive if not even more so than that of a fission reactor.  Fusion does have the advantage of not needing fission fuels and their associated security concerns, but the move to molten salt reactors and a thorium fuel cycle will mitigate this, and regardless, the neutrons from fusion are perfect for breeding large amounts of tritium in the coolant blanket which is used in thermonuclear bombs, and consequently strictly controlled. The  [MIT ARC fusion reactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARC_fusion_reactor)  design does this in it's FliBe blanket for fuel production.  Fuel scarcity isn't really a concern for fission, especially once we move to liquid fuels, thorium, and fast spectrum breeder reactors, which also greatly reduces the life of the waste.  Fusion is often cited as being safer than fission because only a small amount of fuel is present in the reactor at any given time, but this is kind of moot since molten salt fission reactors are completely passively safe, and will passively dump/poison the fuel through a freeze plug or neutron poison if something goes wrong.  I reckon that fusion, at least for the foreseeable future, shares similarities with the accelerator driven fission reactor concepts out there in that they go out of the way to create an over complicated and expensive solution to a problem which does not really exist.  I do believe that eventually fusion will be energy source of choice, especially if we can achieve aneutronic fusion,  which would allow for direct conversion to electricity and would be amazing for spacecraft propulsion, but for generating heat in modern power plants or industrial processes, fission is just so much easier and cheaper to do."

I think the key aspect of SMRs is the ""modular"" part. A huge amount of NPP construction time is all the inspections that must be completed throughout. If large chunks of a reactor can be delivered from a factory with all the pipework and welds already inspected that could cut time out of construction."
Herr_U,2020-06-17 12:30:42,fv475ff,t3_haonlg,t3_haonlg,"An RPV (reactor pressure vessel - the thing that holds the core) is usually about 5-8meter in diameter and 7-20meter in height (varies a lot) for the range of about 600-1700MWe. While this might seen big the turbines can easily be 80meters or longer each.  If you take a look at google maps (or your aerial photography service of choice) for Ringhals Kärnkraftverk (ringhals nuclear power plant) and switch to aerial/satellite photographs you can easily spot three round grey buildings - they are the reactor buildings of PWR, slightly north-northwest of the northernmost PWR you'll also find a grey rectangular building, that one is a BWR reactor building.    Right next to these reactor buildings (north-east) you find a huge rectangular building (dark grey), that is the turbine hall - it isn't unheard of for nuclear plants to feature multiple turbine buildings per reactor building.  Then we also have all the extras (parking lot, offices, fire station, harbour/railway for transports...) - when getting right down to it a nuclear power plant is only a large industrial site that happens to have turbine buildings and a reactors on it.  So reducing the size of a core size doesn't really do that much, but reducing the output will allow you to use more compact turbines.  And people have built small plants - take a look at Pevek/Akademik Lomonosov, that barge that google maps will point you to is the entire plant (however it is only 35x2 MWe)  (I picked Ringhals since it is a mixed technology plant - all units are in the 880-1200MWe size (1970s tech)).  &amp;#x200B;  For the question of how SMR will help with smaller plants - with lower output per core one can use smaller turbines (as well has having more options for types of turbines). Also since they basically are intended to only be opened in factory you don't need things like fuel storage (which will be at the factory) and lots of the extras for maintance. However you basically still will have an industrial site (but probably only a mid-sized one)). The plant boundrary probably will be smaller as well.  There are nuclear power plant designs that ship as three shipping contianers (one for reactor, one for turbine, one for auxillary things (like control)). (Look up vSMR (very-) for more on this)"

Herr_U,2020-06-17 16:21:03,fv4wb9a,t3_haonlg,t1_fv4rhv4,"No idea about supercritical CO2 turbines - havn't had reason to dive into thsoe.  Regarding stacking - you could but the question is why would you want to?  For instance the parking lots (yes, there are several) at a nuclear power plant are divided into what function they service (for instance you wouldn't want the firetrucks to be parked underground). Also it would make piping a whole lot harder, not to mention structural integrity (even finding bedrock suitable for the weight of a nuclear power plant is something of an issue). Underground parking lots also only makes sense when space is at a premium, considering the distance you want between plant boundrary and the critical components you could put a parking lot there.  Having the offices in a separate building makes things a lot easier - like not having to scan everyone at the office for contaminents each time they enter or exit, and not needing to have the offices engulfed by the higher security systems (both in terms of clearance, guards, and actual safety (for instance some reactor are designed to hermetically seal during some particular faults (thereby savining the surrounding areas by sacrifying everyone inside the building))).  The transmission infrastructure is something with high fire risk (relative, and in all fairness so are the offices) so you want them placed far away. Transmission infrastructure is usually also vanishingly small on the plant-side, but on the grid side it usually is a complex set of structures that makes the turbine buildings look small and placed right outside the plant.   One thing to also remember is that anything that touches the reactor building would require a (re)certification or a notification, so having everything placed in different buildings means that you save a couple of years of legal stuff each time you want to make a change (like - say - build a gym in the office, or change computers), and would allow you to stick with normal requirements rather than nuclear requirements.  But if you want to reduce the plant size at all cost then reduce the legal requirements for how much of a safety zone is needed being radiological activity and areas accessible to the public.   However - where does this obsession with reducing plant size comes from? I mean, you could easily put a 2x1350MWe plant inside 400x350m (that is more power and energy than in Hoover Dam)."

vegiimite,2020-06-22 05:08:41,fvlxlcp,t3_h0df9e,t3_h0df9e,"I think these stats artificially skew against renewables.  Particularly for solar as they receive the ITC.  For example, with made up numbers to illustrate, if a solar farm costs a $1/watt you can get a MW farm for $1,000,000 of that you receive 30% back due to the ITC so $300,000.  In it's first year of operation at 20% capacity it generates about 1.7 GWh.  Its subsidy in its first year of operation is $171/MWh.  By year 2 this drops to $86/MWh after 25 years it is only $6/MWh.  So as each year is adding a growing capacity of new plants it is skewing the subsidy up. The grant is front loaded but generation is back loaded.  Newer plants are also cheaper per MW installed, leading to newer plants generating more MWh for same 30% subsidy.  So if a new plant is $.50/MW and lasted 30 years instead of 25 it would be very comparable to nuclear at about $2.85/MWh.  Similarly with wind.  The PTC is only on first 10 years of operations, so until new fields age it skews the subsidy numbers.  Plants get $24/MWh for those 10 years, then the PTC effectively drops in half once the plant reaches 20 years old.  But new plants, I think coming online in 2021, are only getting 60% of the PTC.  So over 20 years about $7/MWh; less the longer the plant stays operational.   Edit: fixed some grammar"

I tend to think the reason it failed was partly that... But what is the synergy with LWRs? They both kinda run on the same thing, no?  As I look, I'm flabbergasted at all the good designs that never got a chance.. my God this is insane."
Herr_U,2020-06-23 03:23:16,fvph4iu,t3_haonlg,t1_fvoxtd3,"The AFCR is the ""Advanced Fuel CANDU Reactor"", basically a CANDU-6 optimized to a mindboggling degree. The Qinshan CANDUs are the demonstrators for it. It is the CANDU variant that is verified to use natural uranium, NUE, thorium, and direct use of spent LWR fuel (DUPIC).   The CANDU that needs enriched uranium is the ACR (Advanced Candu Reactor)  The synergy is the DUPIC, baically four 1GWE LWRs will provide enough spent fuel to power a CANDU-AFCR (740MWe) by spent fuel direct use alone. (CANDU has about 25% lower fresh uranium requirements than LWR, DUPIC is a very direct demonstration of what this means).  I'm also kinda amazed at the pure number of designs that never got the chance (also makes one kinda cynical when somone wants to tell about ""a new nuclear reactor"" and one can't do anything but notice that the principles of it was demonstrated in actual reactors more than half a century ago)."
A-T-Pete,2020-06-24 13:57:54,fvuo6cs,t3_hbf22o,t1_fva7n8a," Poland's President is a populist idiot that's pushing coal, they have the dirtiest plants in the EU and contribute to 10% of total EU CO2 emissions. It's a sad state of affairs.  [https://youtu.be/osm5vyJjNY4](https://youtu.be/osm5vyJjNY4)      This is a worthy watch. And a deeply sad one."
