You speak as if it's impossible for both non-violent and violent actions to coexist within a given movement or struggle. More often than not they work in tandem, though not always in an intentional, concerted way. For every MLK there was a Malcolm X. For every Gandhi there was a Bhagat Singh. This principle is called ""diversity of tactics"".  Both violent and non-violent actions can be channelled and controlled by dominant powers. Both can be co-opted and turned against their original intent. Both can end up being either a totally ineffective response to the existing establishment, or a grave danger to it, depending on the circumstances. What matters is not the specific methods we make use of, but the ability to disrupt existing power structures, install alternative forms of organization, and defend those alternative forms from those who would seek to crush or subvert them. Sometimes this can only be achieved through non-violent means, sometimes it can only be achieved through violent ones. Usually it's a mix of both.  But anyone who claims that the major social justice victories of the last couple centuries were achieved through non-violent means alone is simply engaging in historical revisionism."

Erica Chenoweth and Maria Stephan explored it in their 2011 book *Why Civil Resistance Works: The Strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict* (part of Columbia Studies in Terrorism and Irregular Warfare) and found this:  &gt; “The most striking finding is that between 1900 and 2006, nonviolent resistance campaigns were nearly twice as likely to achieve full or partial success as their violent counterparts.”  That’s not to say violent campaigns did not work or that nonviolence alone suffices; just that nonviolence has a historically better success rate.

People will suffer and sadly many millions will die.   We are seeing so many tipping points on the horizon that are starting to feed on themselves and accelerate the whole process: - ice sheets and caps shrinking rapidly, thus reducing the amount of sunlight energy reflected back in space, ie increasing the amount of solar energy absorbed by earth.  - arctic permafrost melting, leading to vast quantities of methane release (a GHG) in the atmosphere, helped also by fracking by the way.  - drought and extreme heat fuelling frequency and intensity of forest fires, which release even more CO2 in the atmosphere.  - desertification due to adverse weather conditions, which reduces the natural process of vegetation capturing carbon as it grows.  -  ... and a few more.    The world and climate as we have known it for 100s of years is going away and there is nothing to stop it or recover it.  The choices are: - act now and we’ll secure a challenging climate outcome but tolerable and stabilised.  - act later and we’ll have a very bad outcome, where only a smaller global population can survive in shrinking habitable areas. Worse case it will be an extinction event.   What frightens me the most will be the conflicts that will arise as a result of mass climate migrations and the fight to secure vital resources (water sources and arable land)."

I largely agree - I'd never suggest that violent means are appropriate or defensible in every situation, that they should be anywhere close to a first resort, or that they're necessarily more effective than nonviolent means. I just think it's unreasonable to automatically write off those campaigns or condemn those people who decide to employ violent means as part of a struggle that we'd otherwise characterize as just. And besides, it's just very difficult to make such clear distinctions between violent and nonviolent campaigns, whether we're talking about a single campaign that entails both violent and nonviolent elements, or a situation where a number of campaigns, both violent and nonviolent, are operating simultaneously within a broader movement or historical context.   The authors actually do a great job of addressing this issue:  &gt;Labeling one campaign as “nonviolent” and another as “violent” is difficult. In  many  cases,  both  nonviolent  and  violent  campaigns  exist  simultaneously among different competing groups. Alternatively, some groups use both non-violent and violent methods of resistance over the course of their existence, as with  the  African  National  Congress  in  South  Africa.  Characterizing  a  campaign as nonviolent or violent simplifies a complex constellation of resistance methods."

But the fact that they fight against regulations is where the corruption lies.    One recent example from another industry was the Boeing MAX.  These industry professionals were laughing at the FAA, knew their aircraft was dangerous, and allowed changes to go through that resulted in two aircraft crashing with complete loss of life.  And why did they do this?  Because of money and only money - Boeing had an arbitrary schedule to keep and its only consideration was money.  Now, we get plenty of people on reddit who come along and say that it has to be money as the most important consideration because the shareholders demand it.  And the corporations answer to their shareholders.  Yes, but corporations also answer to the regulators - in theory.  But we know by stacking the regulators with people who have a monetary interest in the corporation undermines the whole regulatory process.  Yes, shareholders demand that money, their money, be the most important consideration in every scenario.  And so it is with the energy companies. They too have stacked up the local and federal regulatory bodies to undermine common sense in the interest of profit.  And we are all crashing now because of it."

And this is apparently due to the inclusion of more sophisticated cloud microphysics modules and satellite data regarding CLW, affecting Southern Oceans in particular.   I don't think we know enough yet to outright dismiss these new model values. In either way, actually. We should expect more research into this matter. Notoriously, cloud climate interactions have large uncertainties involved with them still.

I would strongly encourage reading Hans Rosling's book Factfulness, which (among other things) talks about how our cognitive biases mean we tend to miss gradual long-term improvements while over-emphasizing isolated negative incidents.  It gave me a different take on the state of the world.   What pulled me out of a state of ""doomism"" was this sparking the realization that things are slowly starting to turn in the right direction -- towards meaningful action fighting climate change.   As a couple examples of trends that give me hope that we'll beat climate change yet:  * [Prices for renewable energy are rapidly dropping](https://data.bloomberglp.com/professional/sites/24/BNEF-Figure-2-LCOE-Report-1H-2020_WP.png) (this graph is VERY worth viewing), to the point where they [pose a direct business and economic threat to fossil fuels](https://about.bnef.com/blog/scale-up-of-solar-and-wind-puts-existing-coal-gas-at-risk/)     * This provides a free-market solution to climate change, which helps drive reductions in carbon emissions in cases where national governments are not taking action (such as the US).  While it seems slow, **this long-term trend may have a bigger impact than any single government action can.**     * Outcome: [76% of new generation capacity in the US in 2020 will come from wind or solar](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=42495#).  Absolutely incredible stuff, never thought I'd see the day!     * New [projections show that with achievable policies the USA could 90% decarbonize their powergrid by 2035](https://electrek.co/2020/06/09/amazing-green-energy-goal-us-2035-policies-berkeley/) - largely as a result of falling renewable energy prices * Fossil fuel extraction has dropped due to COVID-19, and many projects are getting cancelled.  Example: [Teck canceled a $20B CAD tar sands project in Canada](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/teck-frontier-1.5473370) citing protests and climate change policies in Canada. * Large investment companies such as BlackRock and JP Morgan are divesting from fossil fuels companies and committing to large investments in [climate initiatives](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jp-morgan-investor-day-climatechange/jpmorgan-chase-plans-to-unveil-climate-initiatives-at-investor-day-idUSKCN20I2GI?il=0) * Prices for lithium-ion batteries are rapidly dropping, and within the next couple years it should be possible to get EVs cheaper than ICE cars -- this should directly address one of the largest sources of emissions * Polls show steadily rising public awareness of the dangers of climate change -- this can drive policy changes in governments. [Climate change denial is down to just 3% in the world now](https://theconversation.com/the-number-of-climate-deniers-in-australia-is-more-than-double-the-global-average-new-survey-finds-140450) - and just 12% in the US.  * Governments are increasingly implementing carbon pricing around the world -- the EU has increased their carbon pricing, Canada's carbon tax went into effect in 2019, and there's even talk that China may be rolling out some form of carbon pricing (though I haven't heard anything lately, since COVID-19 shook things up)     * All of these measures provide direct financial incentives to reduce emissions, driving decarbonization * Carbon-capture R&amp;D is proceeding rapidly as funding increases (I only know this because I'm pretty active in Futurology).  It's not to the point where it's ready for economic large-scale deployment yet, but it's progressing towards that goal.  There's hope that we will indeed be able to directly reduce atmospheric carbon by the time we approach net-zero emissions otherwise  **TL;DR: Emissions are not falling *yet* globally, but trends are pushing the world more and more rapidly towards climate change solutions.  In some ways *hope* has never been brighter.  Remember that compound interest is amazingly powerful: exponential trends can drive transformations to happen practically overnight, after an initially very slow start.  Compounding growth in decarbonization technologies may be a mighty force for rapid  progress.

It shows German hard coal is HALF what it was in the mid-2000s, and brown coal is down about 1/3 as of 2019.  2020 numbers should show an even more dramatic decline in coal use, due to the lockdowns reducing energy demand and driving out some marginal fossil fuel powerplants.   &gt; I doubt a total energy revolution can happen in 10 years - but in 15  15 is definitely do-able.  Depending on how you define ""total energy revolution"" 10 years might actually be viable, [given how rapidly solar PV, wind, and battery prices have been plummeting](https://data.bloomberglp.com/professional/sites/24/BNEF-Figure-2-LCOE-Report-1H-2020_WP.png).  Every dollar invested in solar PV goes 5x as far as it did in 2010, and 2x as far for onshore wind.    And in the last 10ish years, Germany has gone from a modest amount of renewable energy to using it for **nearly half** of your electricity.  Doubling the amount of renewables again is likely to happen, because it's now a cheaper source of electricity than continuing to burn coal.  That won't completely eliminate coal or natural gas use for power -- the variability in wind and solar means that a small percentage of fossil fuel generation will probably be needed to fill in small gaps (unless storage gets rolled out at massive scale).  But it'll likely cut the amount of coal use down to very little.   Predictions based on EV market uptake and pricing (primarily driven by batteries) suggest that the next 10 years will include electrification of much of the ground transportation (especially cars and trucks). Edit: especially if they do something like a cash-for-clunkers program to get old ICE cars off the road early.  It's hard to accurately predict with exponential or sigmoidal trends though, because they're very sensitive to variations in initial data.  But there's good reason to think that an energy revolution within 10-15 years is viable and should be our goal."

Solutions as a series of steps, each of which takes us in a better direction.  There is uncertainty about the later steps, but we know what next steps to take, so we take them.  First we reduce our emissions as fast as possible while investing in [R&amp;D for carbon capture technologies](https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/science-tech/engineers-find-neat-way-turn-waste-carbon-dioxide-useful-material) and researching+implementing ways to mitigate feedback loops.  As one example of mitigation, there's a lot of active work on ""re-greening"" lands to capture additional carbon in vegetation -- while its not a universal panacea, it can buy us a little more time.  And those extra years add up, allowing more time to bring solutions to fruition.  Each time we buy a little more time to respond, that pushes the timeline out and compounds with solutions being further progressed.   Then we roll out carbon capture at scale, and try to figure out how to address feedback loops.    If the worst of the feedback loops materialize, there are dramatic geo-engineering solutions we might apply.  For example, orbital mirrors."

Though there are of course those who have legitimately given up due to depressing news.  The issue I'm most worried about is the timescale and the fact that we are running out of it, coupled with the inaction or poor attempts from the biggest polluters. The US on a government/federal level is doing nothing but exarcebate the whole situation. I need not go into details, I'm sure. China has vowed to hit peak emissions soon, and many argue it might have already done so, but this doesn't really help with GHG concentrations rapidly increasing. Though you can't really expect that a country where 40% of the population lived off of less than 150$ a month recently, to do more to cut emissions as the richest country in the world, right?  There's still some hope though. In the US, if you forget about federal/governmental levels, there is a lot action happening towards renewables in particular. China is investing massively in renewables and building them, not only due to climate change reasons, but also air quality. Something where the interests align well.  But it's all politics at this stage, so the most important thing we can do is vote right (where possible). Individual actions to cut emissions can only do so much.

Activists are often attacked for being flawed messengers.  It's really not fair.  These are generally just everyday people who have taken it upon themselves to get involved, research, and network.  They're always going to be playing at a huge disadvantage to someone in power, if not because of their age, than because of something else.  So, yea, age isn't relevant to me here, except as it pertains to Kasich, because he clearly has the mental agility of a dinosaur."

Let's say Kasich has no actual beliefs or intention of helping anyone but himself.  The only think you can offer are reasons to support your cause.  Soundbites he needs for his people.  You like clean water for drinking and farming?  How do historic droughts sound?  Sprinkle in some historic hurricanes to flood the water treatment facilities and destroy whats left of crops every once in a while.  What will future disasters cost, when past baby disasters like Harvey and the 5 other 500-year floods Houston had in the last 5 years cost X?  Can we talk about what to do about it now?  What if the companies that do something about it end up making more money than companies that don't?  The future is electric cars and virtual nirvana, not loud machines blasting your hearing while covering you in coal dust at the bottom of a mine.  What side do your people really want to be on?  *Now* can we talk about what to do?  Taiwan has 7 deaths due to covid because their government listened to their scientists, and they never ever went into lockdown, so their economy is just fine.  Now I'm tired of giving you reasons to help yourself, please pull yourself up by your bootstraps, take some personal responsibility, and let's figure out how the free market can price in rewards for ""protecting God's Earth"", instead of letting the devil chase short-term profits.  Or something like that in language he'll hear.  Idk, these are just armchair quarterback thoughts.   Kudos to the girls who put this on, I'm sure there's reasons it's not this simple &amp; they did hold their own - Kasich is a master level politician.  I'd rather not enter a room with him, no matter how nice he comes off compared to the other R's."

grossbuster,2020-07-14 07:30:22,fy0khte,t3_hqexx7,t3_hqexx7,The amount of wells in Alberta that have not been shut down properly is insane. And all those diehard oil &amp; gas supporters will be paying for it in the end. I’m not against oil &amp; gas and definitely think a plan for cleaner and green energy is a good idea. It’s the fact these COMPANIES are leaving the COST OF CLEAN UP TO ALL ALBERTANS. 😤
