5th_Law_of_Robotics,2019-10-06 13:37:14,f2r25ct,t3_de36lh,t3_de36lh,Feminism is for men too. Feminism means strict equality and nothing else.   Also feminism means violently assaulting men to punish them for any slight.
5th_Law_of_Robotics,2019-10-06 13:55:26,f2r6587,t3_de3j3e,t3_de3j3e,"&gt;Two weeks later I had to be moved to another childcare centre. They said the claims had been proven to be false. They’d interviewed the parents and it turned out they’d put words in the little girl’s mouth.  &gt;I asked why, and was told, “Because the parents don’t believe men should be working in childcare.”   This is the toxic femininity that permeates society and which has yet to be seriously addressed.   MRAs and egalitarians don't have the numbers yet to do so. Feminists aren't interested. Tradcons align with the parents."
Kore624,2019-10-06 14:18:49,f2rbdad,t3_de3j3e,t1_f2r6587,This is a result of gender roles and stereotypes. People who are not feminists *or* MRAs *or* egalitarians (aka most of the population) don’t care or don’t know about their sexist bias and so continue to perpetuate harmful stereotypes.  Everyone who cares about gender and gender  stereotypes and roles knows this is sexist and wrong.
5th_Law_of_Robotics,2019-10-06 14:21:43,f2rc1cj,t3_de3j3e,t1_f2rbdad,"&gt;This is a result of gender roles and stereotypes.    Correct. Toxic femininity.   &gt;People who are not feminists *or* MRAs *or* egalitarians (aka most of the population) don’t care or don’t know about their sexist bias and so continue to perpetuate harmful stereotypes.    Which happens to align with traditional conservative and feminist thinking on this.   &gt; &gt;Everyone who cares about gender and gender  stereotypes and roles knows this is sexist and wrong.    Well, not everyone.   Feminists fight against shared custody, favor making it easier to convict men of sex crimes based solely on an accusation, and oppose any real efforts to get more men in to teaching or child care.   Having a monopoly on raising and caring for children confers a lot of power on women. Feminists won't give that up without a fight."

Lol yes you do. In practice you'd never be ok with this.     &gt;Shocking, 5th Law thinks women being impolite is a direct attack on all men.    Yeah that's not at all what's happening. Unless giving a woman a black eye for looking at you wrong is merely being impolite. &gt;   &gt;More women are sexually assaulted and raped by men than vice versa,    Impossible to say since it's not generally considered a crime when women do this to men.    &gt;which is what the article is about.

C0dey,2019-10-06 20:34:36,f2tesy3,t3_de3j3e,t1_f2t2575,"Toxic masculinity refers to stereotypical masculine norms that can be harmful to men, women, and society overall; this concept of toxic masculinity is not intended to demonize men or male attributes, but rather to emphasize the harmful effects of conformity to certain traditional masculine ideals.  Unfortunately it has been misused by Feminists and the like so much that it is basically been used to deminize men. Much like you're doing with toxic Feminity, which is essentially what I posted above for men but directed towards women.   Toxic femininity is when women use their gender to obtain certain privileges. It is when noxious, indirect modes of confrontation are masked with gentleness. It is when empathy turns into ethical shortsightedness, as well as aspects of traditional femininity perceived to reinforce neuroticism, hysteria and other negative qualities. Like Toxic Masculinity, Toxic Femininity hurts everyone.   Which is why I think both terms are stupid, and should be combined into a gender neutral term, but I digress."

In the state of NY, for example, using your training to retaliate against someone is assault with a deadly weapon. People who are officially trained to use their body as a weapon are held to higher standards. This is because of two reasons. First, almost every single self-defense martial arts courses train people to understand the difference between retaliating against someone versus actually defending yourself. Second, these people are more dangerous.  I don't know where you got this sexist bullshit from. Maybe you see sexism anywhere you turn.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Is any physical retaliation against being assaulted worse that what the perpetrator is doing..?  I never typed in your narrow black and white terms. One act is a crime. The other act is also a crime. How you choose to sort through that information with your fucked up little brain is up to you. Doing something to halt an ongoing transgression - ***opposed to beating someone after the fact to make them fear your gender*** \- is permissible to very few cases when you cannot reasonably flee, access emergency services, and so on.  So just like any other street fight subreddit, you're salivating at the opportunity to see someone beat another person, while advocating for it. You're a joke to everybody who comes across these messages and nobody cares what you have to say, anyways.

The goal is to make men afraid of the *consequences*. Knowing that women will no longer smile nervously and shuffle away or ignore their assaults. If you know a woman is likely to shove you or slap you instead of just ignore it, you’re less likely to do it and it’s no longer “innocent fun”. Physical violence, no matter how minor, seems to be the last resort to get men to stop assaulting women. And men have that same right to retaliate against anyone who assaults them as well. Women should not feel entitled to anyone’s body   &gt; She didn't say everyone. She said she wants men to be afraid of women.  Maybe because women are already afraid of men lol And like I said, “afraid” means they fear the consequences of their negative actions. Why isn’t it strange that men are not already afraid of assaulting women?  And “patriarchy” is not synonymous with “men”.     Everyone should be able to retaliate when they’re sexually assaulted. It’s not sexist to get angry when someone touches you sexually *on purpose* without permission.

I thought it was about the patriarchy, not men.    &gt;Maybe because women are already afraid of men lol And like I said, “afraid” means they fear the consequences of their negative actions. Why isn’t it strange that men are not already afraid of assaulting women?      They are. Which is why women are assaulted at vastly lower rates than men.   &gt;And “patriarchy” is not synonymous with “men”.   So are women part of that patriarchy?   &gt; &gt;Everyone should be able to retaliate when they’re sexually assaulted    Explain vawa and Duluth.    &gt; It’s not sexist to get angry when someone touches you sexually *on purpose* without permission.

Patriarchy, the system keeping men in power, will change when men start to fear retaliation for their sexual assaults.  &gt; They are. Which is why women are assaulted at vastly lower rates than men.  We’re talking about sexual assault here. It is a *fact* that men commit most rapes and sexual assaults, it is a *fact* that women are more likely to be raped or sexually assaulted than men.   &gt; So are women part of that patriarchy?  Patriarchy is a society that functions and relies on gender stereotypes and gender roles that favor masculine traits. Patriarchy is why women are seen as caregivers and men are seen as providers and breadwinners. Breaking down gender roles is breaking down patriarchy. Ignoring the the gender roles that women must be quiet and meek and men must be sexually aggressive is simultaneously dismantling the patriarchy and “making men fear women”. Do you understand yet? The only actual people this article is “attacking” is men who sexually assault women.    &gt; Explain vawa and Duluth.  Patriarchy. Women are weak, men are strong. Everyone’s goal should be to dismantle these sexist gender stereotypes and gender roles."

It's feminists who claim to be working for the good of both genders and constantly try to attack and discredit any kind of male collectivism over their issues. Female issues are already magnified and prioritized by society compared to male issues anyways. Feminists already have great levels of political and social influence if they wanted to address men's issues they could have easily done so. But not only did they not do that, they actively prevented any kind of effort from men to address such issues. I doubt they need or deserve any more support from anyone else.   In this sense we are definitely not like the feminists (radical or otherwise) because unlike them we actually do want legal equality and I would like you to show me what exactly you disagree with about that."

Banning of male genital mutilation, ending forced military conscription,  ending child support, ending primary caregiver laws and making shared parenting the default, changing anti male domestic abuse laws based on the feminist Duluth model, giving men equal punishment under the law for the same crime as women, giving men equal access to welfare/ housing/ education/ jobs by removing all female specific quotas and special privileges, etc. These are the ones I can remember off the top of my head."

But all of a sudden they become super chatty over here, and all at the same time, saying the same things, making the same braindead errors in logic or just general fucking syntax.  I asked /u/AnnArchist yesterday how a post they/he made [literally calling for that sub to help him lay the smackdown on us](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProMaleCollective/comments/dfvatg/help_me_lay_the_smackdown_on_fake_mras_concern/) wasn't brigading, but she seemed fine with it.

Axleonder,2019-10-11 12:23:54,f3ayszj,t3_dgd5r5,t1_f3ata63,"&gt;Not a tradcon by far, here, but see a few misconceptions. Some people do actually enjoy their jobs that require long hours and would be doing them anyway, and actually want someone who has a different drive than them, to balance the life they have.  They enjoy a parasite who nags and controls their earnings and free time, they can call themselves a happy slave. They don't need to call themselves ""equal""  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;And Egalitarianism doesn't mean that everything should be made equal everywhere, but rather that people have inherently the same worth and the same rights.  Marriage arranged couples do not have the same worth or the same rights. Also they're considered more worthy than singles because of tax breaks. Stop saying this.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;A person who works 60h/week in a relationship with someone who works 15h/week can completely be egalitarian. I don't see the issue there. People are free to set up their life's as they see fit.  ""Egalitarianism"" Doesn't mean ""set up your own life as you see fit"". Definitions are meant to have standards."

I will pick only a small part of your BS to address :  &gt;Marriage arranged couples do not have the same worth or the same rights. Also they're considered more worthy than singles because of tax breaks. Stop saying this.  Indeed, not everyone has the same rights. That is why there is a need for egalitarianism-informed advocacy.   Egalitarianism doesn't describe the state of the world, but the goal to aspire to.   And it is a goal of equality of rights. Not a prescription on how people should live, which means that the only requirement is to have those goals, those values."

The reason for this post is to create a record of what is happening in case a new person experiences this.  Hopefully, this will help them defend themselves quickly and aggressively. &gt; &gt;The main prong of attack from TamerLoon and the merry band of Lunatics is to launch a “raid” and “brigade” someone’s blog or Youtbe channel. &gt; &gt;[...] &gt; &gt;Kurt left a video where Male Sentient Void/Pro Male Reviolutionary tried to attack some right leaning weirdoes.

We've been dissecting plants for hundreds of years and all the parts are identified.  You're assuming a central nervous system, which many animals lack, is the only option.  MRA is MRA.

This article acts like they haven't been. They're just demanding even more submissiveness to their ideology: ""Men, do as you're told!""   What a crock of shit."
bkrugby78,2019-10-17 10:37:13,f40v0v4,t3_dgg72w,t1_f40cif2,"What's interesting is I read another article like this, just recently.  It had to do with GQ where they interviewed these ""individuals changing masculinity"" or something to that effect.  I always find ""interesting"" that to some, changing masculinity apparently means discussing things that have nothing to do with masculinity.  In my experience as a man on this Earth, the vast majority of individuals, both male and female, reward you if you are confident and go after what you want.  They don't reward complacency.  What's ultimately frustrating, and probably a reason most men put their hands up as if to say ""what is it you want"", is that, like you said, you do listen but then are told to speak up....but only if you speak to the prescribed message feminists want you to say."

pink-sugar-berry,2019-10-17 12:52:17,f41a6z5,t3_dgg72w,t3_dgg72w,"I agree to an extent. I definitely agree that pushing women to be more like men is annoying, but it's not because men are the real problem, its because there really isn't a problem. The wage gap has been debunked. I'm sure there are sexist employers out there, but I really don't think that telling them to apologize more and be less arrogant is going to work.  Both the author's perspective and the one they are arguing against have the bottom line that the solution to workplace discrimination is for men and women to be more alike. Why is that necessary? Men and women are *not* exactly alike.  Overall, I see what the author was trying to say, but it comes off as sort of like, ""guys, check your privilege and let the girls talk."" Its preachy and it stereotypes all men as being abrasive jerks."
bkrugby78,2019-10-17 14:43:42,f41sw35,t3_dgg72w,t1_f41a6z5,Definitely agree there.
mtcapri,2019-10-17 23:36:12,f44n024,t3_dgg72w,t1_f40v0v4,"Exactly. This whole national ""discussion"" (it's not a discussion, but whatever) about what masculinity is and how it needs to be changed does more to associate masculinity with things it never was associated with before (e.g. mass shootings, rape, violence, etc) than it is about de-associating it with those things. It's a hateful thing dressed up as a compassionate thing, but the latter is really just a rationalization for the former, a solution for cognitive dissonance. When feminists deconstructed femininity, they did it by questioning the associations people *actually* had about women, and let women know they didn't have to confine themselves to those things. But men don't feel like they need to rape or be violent to be men; those are false assertions being made by feminists.   It's sickening to watch so many on the Left fall into these patterns, even as they think it's in the service of combating bigotry and sexism. Really, they're engaging in precisely the opposite. But identity politics has won out over the principles of equality in modern times."

Anyone can point out negative actions, but few can promote successful, proactive actions.  We (men) got a lot of problems (women got a lot of problems too, but that's not the current topic).  The only way to address those problems is to have collaboration in addressing them in proactive ways."

You reframe any complaint or disadvantage men have as being an unintended consequence of their oppressive, ""privileged"" status, and then you're free to victim-blame the victims, while still maintaining you're trying to ""help."" It's like saying, ""you're a piece of shit, and all your problems are due to you being a piece of shit, but don't you see—I'm trying to help you with your problems, by teaching you how to not be a piece of shit!"" It's no different than the ""compassionate racist,"" who claims they want to help Blacks by listing statistics that associate horrible crimes with being Black, and insisting that if Black people simply stop being so criminal, their lot will improve. We recognized this horrible tactic a long time ago, but the same strategy is being used now with regard to men."
plo83,2019-10-18 23:32:52,f48kv3g,t3_dge3jm,t1_f3x2ped,No. A feminist and a MRA cannot be an egalitarian.  They care about their gender and its issues alone in most cases.

However, we both need to agree that being an MRA and being an egalitarian who is concentrating their time on men's issues are not the same thing.  The fact is that 5th has admitted to being an MRA on here. So I don't think we can say that he's an egalitarian when he told us that he's not.  It was a paragraph that showed his deep ignorance of the topic.  Paraphrased, it was ''I'm an MRA.  You can't tell me that I'm not an egalitarian''.  Hrrm, yes, yes I can!

It's like saying you support gay rights and are an egalitarian (fine) v I support stoning homosexuals to death and I'm an egalitarian (nope).   MRAs don't seek to harm women and take their rights away. Feminists do seek to harm men and take their rights away.

Men don’t want to share their emotions to a degree that is harmful to themselves? It’s because gender roles tell them they need to be strong and stoic. Women are harassed on the street, it’s because gender stereotypes say men need to be the pursuer and women need to allow it so that men don’t get their feelings hurt by rejection. Men have a harder time getting work in fields with children, because gender roles say women are the better caregivers and men are stereotypically predatory. Little boys who get raped by a teacher are not treated seriously because gender stereotypes say boys are always thinking about sex and want to have sex with their teachers. Etc etc etc etc. you can name any sexist problem and trace it back to gender roles and stereotypes. It has nothing to do with “feminism not caring enough about men’s issues” and EVERYTHING to do with most people not thinking gender stereotypes and roles are a problem in the first place.   &gt; No policies or programs or changes to the law or new funding or anything like that?  Changing policies and laws are a result of these gender stereotypes being challenged and changed. Women being allowed to vote is because feminists challenged the stereotype/role that women were supposed to be silent housewives with no power in politics. Women were allowed to go to school and have jobs for the same reasons. Women were allowed to wear more than just floor length skirts because they challenged gender roles and stereotypes. Men are out here wearing dresses and make up and heels as a result of challenging gender stereotypes, men asking for equal custody are fighting gender stereotypes.   Feminism creating positive changes usually for women does not mean they are against positive changes for men. But women cannot force men to challenge stereotypes. Most women choose for themselves to challenge gender roles and stereotypes, that does not mean the progress *we* make is not possible for men."

Russelsteapot42,2019-11-05 22:13:25,f6ni4cg,t3_drr0qt,t1_f6neb2t,"Her name is Mary Koss, and she specifically said ""Although men may sometimes sexually penetrate women when ambivalent about their own desires, these acts fail to meet legal definitions of rape that are based on penetration of the body of the victim. Furthermore, the data indicate that men’s experiences of pressured sex are qualitatively different from women’s experiences of rape. Specifically, the acts experienced by men lacked the level of force and psychologically distressing impact that women reported.""  Things like the CDC not calling men made to penetrate women 'rape' and the Dear College letter that tells universities to prosecute sexual assault charges in private tribunals can be traced to her work fairly directly."

Everyone can get on board with his peace and love and tolerance movement. Then after he dies it turns out he kicked dogs in private. His congregation had no idea. They only liked the peace and love bit. The kicking dogs bit wasn't a factor in their support for his public message. When they find out they're disgusted.

She cites what I believe to be this paper:  https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01541620 which is a study of 204 college men.  You can evaluate that paper yourself, but please do not fail to consider the monumental bias that the phrase 'ambivalent about their own desires' reveals: Mary Koss does not believe that any man is ever truly unconsenting to sex, and so we should look very carefully about how any data she creates or chooses to use is produced.  We also need to take into account whether the psychological impact of social enforcement of masculinity might have affected the willingness of male victims to admit to experiencing distress. Especially given that we're looking at a study published in 1994."

She is saying that “rape” should refer to when your body is penetrated only. And that other forms be called “sexual assault”. She is not saying that women cannot rape men, or that women who assault men in any way should get away with it.   When you’re body is penetrated your risk for injury increases dramatically, your risk for infertility increases, your risk for contracting an std increases, and if you’re a woman you’re at risk for pregnancy which in and of itself can be life threatening and cause other medical issues. Being forced to penetrate is a different crime and should be called as such. Both men and women can be *raped* by both men or women, and both men and women can be *sexually assaulted* by men or women.  The different terms are to make the distinction between the effects it has on the victim.   And no, not every feminist or every random person agrees with this. Both crimes should be punished the same, but I do not think it’s sexist to have different terms for “forced to penetrate” and “forcefully penetrated”"

So, as I said, show me times where this piece of shit was a claimed by MRAs as exemplary after it was made widely public his support of pedophilia, and I might have an agreement that these people are fucked up.  It doesn't reflect on MRA, though, in the same way that if a guitarist kills people, not all guitarists are killers. Being an MRA implies just doing activism on behalf of men's rights. That's literally how language work. It is an activity.  On the other hand, feminism is an ideology, it has beliefs attached to it, it has a body of ""scholarly"" (I put that between quotes because I wouldn't want anyone to mistakenly think it is remotely scientific) litterature, and so on, that justifies and push its bad ideas. Hitler was a vegetarian, but not all vegetarians are tied to Hitler, because being a vegetarian only requires to do something, and implies nothing on your motivations for doing that thing.

The chances of getting HIV or other STDS from a man having PIV sex with an infected woman is 1 in 1,000.   https://www.hiv.va.gov/patient/faqs/risk-of-unprotected-sex-with-woman.asp   The chances of a woman getting HIV from PIV sex with an infected man is higher simply because of anatomy. The entire vagina is a mucus membrane that can absorb an std from pre cum or semen, and microtears that can occur just from normal sex and are very likely during a rape increase her chances of infection.

Russelsteapot42,2019-11-07 06:35:02,f6rlbpr,t3_drr0qt,t1_f6o0nzd,"&gt; She is saying that “rape” should refer to when your body is penetrated only. And that other forms be called “sexual assault”  Actually, Koss said, when asked in a radio interview, that she would only call this 'Unwanted contact', even when presented with the case of a man who was drugged into unconscousness.  https://soundcloud.com/889-wers/male-rape  &gt;Theresa Phung: So I am actually speaking to someone right now.  His story is that he was drugged, he was unconscious, and when he awoke a woman was on top of him with his penis inserted inside her vagina, and for him that was traumatizing.  If he was drugged what would that be called?  &gt;Mary Koss: What would I call it? I would call it unwanted contact.  Also:  &gt;but I do not think it’s sexist to have different terms for “forced to penetrate” and “forcefully penetrated”  It's not necessarily sexist, but what it does is enables sexism. When male victims already have difficulty being taken seriously, using a different term for the form of sexual assault that they most commonly face is a good way to make sure that they are not taken seriously.  By the same standard it wouldn't necessarily be homophobic to have a different legal term for a same-sex marriage. In reality it doesn't work out that way."

There is a justice system. It exists for a reason. Let it do what it is supposed to.  The university shouldn't be expected to do anything. The rule of law means that people are treated as innocent until proven otherwise. If a university wish to have a rule that people who are convicted can't attend, then so be it, although I find this kind of approach doubtful as I would say that access to education is a good part of rehabilitation. But until the allegations are proven true in a court of law, it would be mob rule to have universities do anything.

Except that it's an unnecessary distinction which enables sociopaths to claim that men can never deny consent.  &gt;Really? Men have had their internal orgasm perforated from being forced to penetrate? 53% of men who are forced to penetrate have injuries and bleeding from their penis?   You can break the penis by forcing a man to have sex.  &gt;The chances of getting HIV or other STDS from a man having PIV sex with an infected woman is 1 in 1,000.   That's a non-zero chance. At this point you are fishing for reasons to maintain an artificial distinction created by a sociopath.  &gt;And then fight your rapist for visitation rights and child support.   And if a woman forces a man to have sex against his will, she can get pregnant and sue him for child support. That's already happened.  &gt;Not at all.Of course they have psychological trauma just like a woman would have.   Then you shouldn't be justifying the artificial distinction.

Universities that receive government money have to follow Title IX.  It was reasonable and was directed at real problems when it passed in 1972. Unfortunately, it's been so broadly applied since then that it is now being used to justify things far beyond the scope of what the original authors intended. And because universities don't have the authority or competency of the criminal justice system, they're being led into a legal minefield."

TL/DR though, Title IX was originally just about making sure female college athletes had the same athletic opportunities male students did, so if you had a male basketball team, you had to have a female basketball team, etc. Later, it got expanded to include instances of sexual harassment, because the argument was made that women who had to deal with sexual harassers on campus couldn't take equal advantage of the school, due to fears of being sexually harassed on campus. From there, it wasn't a long leap to including sexual assault/rape. Even then though, schools put their reputation before students' interests, which meant complaints about harassment and assault got swept under the rug, rather than dealt with the way the law intended them to be. So, in 2011, the Obama administration said schools that failed to comply would lose their federal funding (*huge* amounts of money), which has since caused universities to flip the script and just start auto-convicting any student accused. They still don't have any real interest in providing justice, just keeping their reputations and funding intact.   I agree with you—schools have neither the inclination nor the training to adjudicate these sorts of cases, and they should be handled by the police and criminal courts. Schools should only be responsible for providing accusers/accuseds counseling and accommodations to ensure they can continue to attend the college."

I'm not sure, but it's possible even the original implementation was intended to be gender-neutral, meaning women harassing men could be banned under Title IX back then too. Again, not sure about the finer legal points, but then even more than now, culture enforcement of the rules was probably gender-biased in favor of women. (EDIT: What I mean is that Title IX probably wasn't used to help male victims of sexual harassment back then, just as it typically isn't now; unfortunately, back then, it often wasn't used to help female victims either, and that practice *has* improved under Obama's new policies. It's just come at a terrible price.)  As far as sexual harassment is concerned though, I think the idea was that college campuses should be held accountable to prevent sexual harassment on their campuses in the same way companies were required to prevent it in their offices. The argument being that sexual harassment isn't technically a crime, so criminal courts and police have no jurisdiction over it. That's obviously not the case for sexual assault though."

You’re right. Whenever women are encouraged to be weak and helpless I’ve always seen it called out. I’ve really only seen these things encouraged in super religious groups, and the only people I’ve seen agree with them are other ultra-religious people. These expectations are usually called out, so it’s not a widespread pressure on most women like being stoic and strong is with men.   &gt; So then perhaps we would call men's conception of themselves as inherently violent, oppressive, disposable, and of value only through being useful to others as 'internalized misandry'?  Only if they were making fun of other men for doing non-harmful traditionally masculine things, like a non-athletic man making fun of other men for body building or playing sports. Thinking bad things about yourself isn’t “internalized x”,   Basically, when the gender role is taken to an extreme and becomes harmful, that’s “toxic x”, when the gender role is not harmful but is made fun of by someone who doesn’t want to conform, that’s “internalized x”.

Being rational and not overly emotional is a masculine trait, taking it to an extreme where you can’t/refuse to express emotion to the point where it has negative effects on your mental health is when it becomes TOXIC.  It’s associated with *masculinity* because women are not pressured by society/culture to keep their emotions down and it’s expected that women will be more emotional."

Animals rape and kill each other all the time. As humans we know certain acts are wrong. As humans we have a complex culture and society and self awareness. We are not naturally racist or homophobic or sexist, we are taught to be this way. Not too long ago women weren’t allowed to have jobs or any position of power. In many places now women are still not allowed to do much and are treated as second class citizens. Is that natural according to you, since some females of other species are submissive to males? When does the comparison to animals stop?   Obviously there are natural things men and women find attractive in the opposite sex, and there is always a natural urge to be accepted by others, especially the opposite sex, but that doesn’t mean people who don’t fit a certain mold should be shunned or attacked. Not everything a person does in life is to please the opposite sex. Human beings are more complex than animals.   &gt; Women love men who are capable of violence.  Yikes. *Strength* is not the same as violence. Strength is the neutral state, *violence* is when it turns toxic. No one wants a partner to be violent. Men are naturally stronger than women, it makes sense that women would be attracted to a basic trait of the oppose sex.   &gt; And, yes.. men love being the breadwinner.  So what does this mean? Men don’t want women to work? Women secretly don’t like being independent? Do you want equality or not?   &gt; Why do you see news that women can't find eligible men nowadays because women even in this day of equality, somehow wants a man who is superior and makes more than her?.  You mean that one article where the men that older successful women were married to was compared to single men in the area, and the writers concluded that no one was good enough for young successful single women? Without asking what *actual* single successful women were looking for in the first place?  More and more women do not need a man in their life to support them since they work for themselves. Having a breadwinner husband is no longer the main driving force to getting married. Is this disrupting the natural order of things in your opinion? If you think men are naturally supposed to be the breadwinners why do you think it’s sexist for women to avoid men who don’t make as much as them?   &gt; Again reiterating my point, gorillas, elephants and many other animals show traits that feminists consider 'toxic masculinity' like males protecting females, mate guarding, dominance, competence etc.  Again, reiterating my point, feminists don’t give a fuck what animals do, because they’re animals. Why do you keep bringing up these points unless you’re trying to justify these actions in HUMANS?   &gt; According to feminist logic, these behaviors occurs due to culture telling male gorilla's to protect female gorillas. It's enough to destroy the entire feminist and leftwing  narrative that 'toxic masculinity', masculinity, femininity etc are a human social construct.  So let’s look at it this way, a lot of gender roles and stereotypes are based on “animal instincts” that have no place in human society. Finding a mate and pinning her down to forcibly penetrate her is not acceptable in human society, but it’s how almost every mammal finds a mate. Men fighting each other to the death over a woman is not acceptable human behavior. So at what point do we let our “animal instincts” control how we act? Sometimes? Never?"

Many women (most, nearly all) reward men who display ""macho bullshit"", encouraging it generation after generation.    Which leads to the eternal question: if women are promoting and encouraging toxic masculinity, er...  ""macho bullshit"", why is the concept virtually always used as a gender slur against men?  Specifically by feminists?    Whatever the concept started as, now it's just a Kafka trap so feminists can blame men for everything/anything.  Working too hard?  Toxic masculity.  Don't want to work hard?  Toxic masculity.  Too forward?  Toxic masculity.  Not forward enough?  Toxic masculity.

Incidentally some countries and cultures have a lot more of this macho crap than others. America particularly. You don't see it so much in Northern European countries, you see it a lot more in Southern Europe and the Med, especially in countries like Spain and Greece.   Does that say as much about the women of those countries as it does about the men? Probably. Either way I find that macho stuff annoying and childish, but each to their own. As far as a successful strategy, it's not going to go over well with most Dutch or English or Irish women, I can tell you that.

Understand now? We are capable of higher thinking and reasoning than every other animal. Holding humans to the same standards as animals is completely ridiculous.   If a man is having mental health issues and suicidal thoughts, we should NOT sit around and say “well that’s just a *natural* part of being a masculine male!

Meanwhile, the Bailey is that all masculinity is toxic and that toxic masculinity is the fault of men. Basically, calls of toxic masculinity in practice are used to say ""men just have to stop hurting themselves"". Usually, ""toxic masculinity"" is used as a conversation stopper, rather than anything else. It is a smokescreen to give the illusion that feminism is actually concerned about men. It is damage control. It's another way to say ""patriarchy hurts men too, and patriarchy is destroyed by helping women, so help women, and men's issues will all magically disappear"".  Nobody should buy it. Many aren't fooled by it, and that is precisely why everyone understands it perfectly for what it is, a claim that masculinity itself is toxic, in the same way that many have come to use feminist as a shorthand for misandrist.   Brains are pattern recognition machines, and are really good at it. If you constantly have to explain to people that ""toxic masculinity doesn't truly mean that masculinity is toxic"", it is very much because people have seen the term used, seen how it is used, and in which context, and inferred what it meant despite all the flowery BS academic definition that was trying to hide that."

Inability to let go.   - focus on the negative : even if something great happened, what matters is the part that wasn't good. The whole chocolate cake was amazing, except for the cherry on top that was slightly out of place? Well, I am a failure of a cook.  - focus on all the potential negative consequences and interpretations.   You get the idea.   How do you treat that through CBT? You train yourself to have functional thought patterns. How would someone functional react to such a situation? What is the positive aspect of things, what was good, etc.   I recently listened to a podcast on HBRadio with the libertarian Canadian candidate, who explained that he was a firefighter, and when he began, he wanted to do good in terrible situations, but after the first big incident, where he was focusing on how awesome everyone had been and all the good that had been made, they were forced through some group counseling where everyone was asked to focus on how the situation had been terrible and awful things had happened to people, etc, and he thought he was approaching things in an inappropriate way and started to focus on how things had been terrible. Not too long after, he was suffering from PTSD and completely disfunctional, and it took a terrapist making him realize that he was only focusing on the negative, his inability to help in helpless cases, rather than the positive he was bringing to the people in those situations, to come out of it.  This kind of approach is training people into being disfunctional. It's quite the opposite of what should be done. Insisting men talk about their negative emotions is demanding they focus on them, and training them in seeing what is bad, rather than what is good.   I wish people would stop thinking men don't deal properly with their emotions by default, just because they aren't constantly complaining about everything that isn't good."

I mean, when people transition from women to men, and take male hormones, they say they have never been so emotionally stable, when people transition from men to women, and take female hormones, they say they have never been so emotional.  Of the people I know, the more masculine they are, the better grip they have on their emotions.   Even in pop culture, it is women that are known for blowing things out of proportions and making scenes.   Yet, it is men who don't know how to deal with emotions? It is like saying that because we see a lot more shit from babies than from adults being exposed in public, it means that adults are the ones having trouble dealing with their shit, while pointing at the few examples of intestinal occlusion as a reason why holding your shit is is bad for you.

This study is potentially useful.  It shows that psychological abuse by a male caregiver towards a male child may result in higher incidences of problematic and excessive sexual thoughts and behaviours as those male children become adults.  Psychological abuse towards children by a caregiver is always bad.  We should continue to look at the ways abuse from either parent can affect children of either sex.  It is particularly interesting when there are differences.  So while the past study you mentioned seemed to indicate that abuse from a mother leads a boy to become violent, this study now seems to indicate that abuse from a father leads a boy to become more sexually abusive.  It will be interesting to see all the different gendered studies that come out in this political era.  I look forward to more, so long as we can look at all sides of each issue."

JackFisherBooks,2019-12-19 11:23:31,fbda6c3,t3_ecrsg3,t3_ecrsg3,"I wrote this after reading an article in the Pluralist about a woman complaining about her ""perfect"" husband. It caused quite a debate in multiple subs. Some criticized her. Some showed sympathy. Some used this as proof that gender equality is impossible. I didn't agree with many of those remarks, but I think this woman's story highlights some issues surrounding equality that aren't often discussed.  Chief among those issues is boredom. I think people greatly underestimate the impact that boredom plays on peoples' behavior, even when they're in ideal situations. The woman in the article says she has the ideal husband and an equal relationship, but she still finds it frustrating. I think a big part of that frustration is the boredom of everything being so predictable. And that can undermine a relationship, as well as equality in general.  It was an interesting insight into what some might deem an ideal relationship. I welcome any further discussion about it."

Basically, the original article makes it clear that the woman's main gripe is that her husband is ""too moral,"" and since she falls short of his example, she feels shitty about herself. She wants him to do something bad, like cheat on her, so that she would have something to prop up her own ego.   These are nothing but the petty lamentations of a brat who doesn't measure up to the man she married. She isn't bored—she's insecure."

Men rarely go to jail for not paying child support.   &gt; Except men don't have this.  Men keep their bodily autonomy.

He doesn't. Even if she raped him.  Men have full control over when and if they ejaculate. Pregnancy does not happen without a man’s choice. I agree that rape is fucked up and is one of the only instances where a male should have no obligation to pay. I’ve never argued otherwise.   &gt; You don't have to inform the father. She can ditch the kid at a safe Haven and walk away without giving any information. Did you not know that?  If the father is in the picture it wouldn’t happen.

Why is the same standard sexist in your opinion?   &gt;You insist men who have sex have chosen to be parents.  Nope.

Men have the choice of when and where and if to ejaculate. It isn’t necessary to have sex.   Even if a woman chooses abortion, that is still her taking 100% of the responsibility for a man’s choice.

Neither of these choices affects the man physically.  After sex, both men and women keep their bodily autonomy.

In [this one](https://www.workplacebullying.org/gender/) men bully women at a significantly higher rate than the one quoted in the article (65% vs 46%) as well as make up a significantly higher percentage of bullies overall (70% vs 62%).   I think the self reporting nature of these kinds of studies makes the subject a bit of a moving target: men and women tend to have significantly different definitions of [bullying behavior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xS9Y_mjTjc).  Anecdotally speaking, when I think of the lengths many men I know go to so as to avoid even be alone with female co-workers, I have a hard time believing that they would feel safe ""bullying"" them."

Conservatives tend to argue that women just aren't capable as soldiers or should be protected, because they're needed to make and raise babies; feminists tend to argue that, since men are the majority of the government, all wars are men's fault and women shouldn't have to fight in them if they don't want to.   2.) If the outcome is the end of the draft, no one immediately comes to mind. If the outcome is for women to be drafted too, then I'm sure there are plenty of feminist organizations that will oppose it (EDIT: In fact, if that happens, I think we'll finally start to see just how much feminists care about the issue when women are affected, but didn't give a shit about it when only men were)."

Going for option 3 is a long shot and likely ends in option 1. Going for option 2 forces a discussion and a push to a higher court, national attention, a view on the hypocrisy of forcing people based on gender, and forces feminists to ally with MRAs that want the draft abolished.  In the long game, pushing for option 2 is most likely to pass through government and most likely to end up in option 3 due to uproar. Option 3 (ending the draft) is commonly brought up as an end goal and is one of the major goals of the MRA platform. The only reason there's a focus on having women drafted as well is because of the time period of the original *Rostker v. Goldberg* and the legal case that was deemed to succeed.  At the time the draft was considered a core component of a functioning military, and successfully skirted equality requirements drafting women by not allowing women in combat roles. That has since changed and opens up the original precedence ruling up to contention. The next and final stage would be to gather support and push for the removal of the Military Selective Service Act which would have to be removed by elected officials and does not have an easy legal attack vector the way the draft does."

You love claiming, in your typical dishonest bad-faith fashion, that feminists are not specifically pro-female, they're just pro-equality. Which is how you justify hanging out here as long as you have.   But what I see, what all of us see, is that you - in the collective feminist sense - only truly gave a shit about the draft when it became quite feasible that women might be included in it. Sure, feminists liked to *say* that they were all opposed to conscription in principle, but talk - as the saying goes - is cheap.   I've never seen action. I've never seen feminists outright campaign to eliminate the ability of the government to send young men to kill and die. Fighting to eliminate a non-existent wage gap and sexist air-conditioning was deemed more important.   But now that you might be included? *NOW*, now it's time to act.  Am I wrong?

You neither showed me one, nor did you concede that *none ever existed*. You, quite literally, gave me no answer.  You instead tried to pull some rabbinical gotcha bullshit by asking me to point out an MRA group that marched for a female issue. If my question had jackshit to do with MRAs, well, maybe your question would have been relevant. If I had said something about MRAs being superior to feminists, well, maybe your question would have been relevant.   But I didn't. I asked if you could demonstrate a feminist movement to abolish the draft, because I found your illustration of the feminists being opposed to conscription for egalitarian, humane purposes to be disingenuous bullshit, and I still do.  You took that to mean that I am an MRA. You made that assumption because your mind is utterly polluted by partisanism. I said it before, I will say it again. You are a dishonest bad actor. Not least because your red-faced reply to me conveniently ignored that I am both not an MRA, and have always voiced my opposition to conscription as a principle."

In 1981, a group of men brought a case before the Supreme Court that argued being singled out for compulsory registration violated their right to equal protection. A number of women's groups, including the National Organization for Women (NOW), filed briefs contending that exclusion from the draft violated the constitutional rights of women.  ""Compulsory universal military service is central to the concept of citizenship in a democracy,"" the NOW brief asserted. It predicted ""devastating long-term psychological and political repercussions"" would result if women were excluded from ""the compulsory involvement in the community's survival that is perceived as entitling people to lead it and to derive from it the full rights and privileges of citizenship.""”  “""I can't imagine a more tragic loss of liberty than forcing a citizen, whether male or female, to fight in a war with which they may disagree. Equality is a moot point if personal choice and bodily autonomy must first be eliminated to achieve it,"" Mastrine said in a statement.”  “""You don't stop the runaway truck of U.S. foreign policy by throwing a man in front of it, and you definitely don't stop it by throwing a man and a woman, just to make things equal,"" Steigerwald wrote.”"

Their internal beliefs can be whatever they are, but feminists only cared enough to speak up about the draft once it became possible that women might be included in it.  That's very, very important, because the fiction that feminists care about men as well as women, that they care about equality in society rather than the sole advancement of women, is the primary tool by which feminists shut down the advocacy of men's issues.  You say you're opposed to conscription for everyone. Okay, fine, I believe you. What I don't believe is that you cared all that much about it at the end of the day until it became what it is now - a women's issue. I don't believe that you marched and made noise to get conscription abolished, like I imagine - a pure assumption to be fair, correct me if I'm wrong - that you did during the hey-day of #metoo, and the pussyhat women's matches.

This was while men were being conscripted to fight, kill and die in one of the bloodiest and most horrific wars that had ever occurred up to that time. All the while they campaigned for their right to vote, *without* demanding the same responsibility *that comprised the original rationale behind extending suffrage to all men* - the responsibility to participate in the draft.   Your movement was hypocritical and blind to men's issues right from the start.   As for your links, you're very sneakily conflating anti-war with anti-draft. I see angry 2nd-Wave feminists decrying the imperialist US government adventure in Vietnam, but I do not see any feminists decrying conscription in general.  The reason for that can be gathered by the fact that the feminists in your article used the word ""imperialistic"".  2nd-Wave feminism was heavily associated with leftist politics, often Maoist and Marxist-Leninist. Their opposition was not to war, their opposition was not to the conscription and death of American boys - indeed if you had read the first link you would have noticed that they *explicitly* denied that their opposition to the Vietnam War was based on their concern for the men in their lives.   They were simply opposed to the US's involvement in Vietnam.  I repeat again. Feminists have never cared enough about the entirely gendered nature of conscription enough to speak out about it, and that puts the lie to any concern they claim to have for equality."

They seem to weigh Seiya down but the resistances they give outweigh them for him.  ...  It can be presumed that Seiya's armor has extremely high stats, as he never changes it throughout the series after purchasing it from the first village he went to. It's exact stats have yet to be revealed, but given he got it so early it is most likely he upgraded it over time, probably with Ristarte's hair.  ...  Personality  Seiya is defined by his overly cautious nature who refuses to face any enemy he isn't sure that he can beat and he will attack defeated enemies repeatedly on the off chance that they can revive themselves, and worries that any stranger he meets could be an enemy or carry a deadly illness, even his own partner.  ...  Seiya also tends to speak bluntly to others and is quick to express his dissatisfaction with the opinions and actions of others. He seems rather inexperienced and ignorant of socialization, as he has been unable to spot other people's clear romantic feelings for him and has no trouble pouring holy water over strangers heads or picking hairs off Ristarte while she sleeps yet still is unaware of why these actions upset people.  ...

Seiya and Rosalie were engaged in a passionate, critical, evocative, and competitive discourse about their own abilities and responsibilities as warriors.  She accused him of being a dispassionate warrior and he accused her of being indiscreet warrior.  The argument was in essence which style of combat and leadership is most effective.  The consequences of the tactics of warfare argument involved immediate threats of death and defeat for presumably many others.  The test of the argument was an open-handed slap that could not reasonably be expected to cause harm (or perhaps impact).  Her slap was parried and countered, and each successive attempt to attack presumably similarly defended against and requited.  The physical damage inflicted was superficial.  &amp;#x200B;  Feminism advocates for the rights and opportunities of females to participate in every capacity they choose.  Rosalie chose to be involved in a physical confrontation - which was reasonable to the occupation that she and Seiya shared - and was treated equally."

Saying that there aren't many racists really means nothing because it's not like there is a way to measure racism in this country, or what a healthy amount of racism looks like. The fact of the matter is that in 2020, we are still seeing black men being killed for unjustified reasons like George Floyd or Ahmoud Arbery. We are still seeing KKK marches in major cities. We are seeing white nationalist gatherings.  The large majority of victims will be white because... the majority of the country is white, 75% in total. That also makes the majority of all criminals to be white as well because of the same fact.  When I see videos of white Americans in rural areas, I don't see particularly rational people.

So you say that the truth is that they aren't that many racists. I can't help but disagree. What you say isn't a truth first of all; it's an estimation and the incidents I have reported and the many more that aren't reported indicate to me that there is quite a lot of racism in this country, in particular white racism as the country is 75% white. White privilege then is being able to see KKK demonstrations and while you may be disgusted, you know those crazies aren't going to go after you because you happen to be white.

And people only riot when the victim is black.  So let's dig into those stats.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/fatal-police-shootings-of-unarmed-people-have-significantly-declined-experts-say/2018/05/03/d5eab374-4349-11e8-8569-26fda6b404c7_story.html  In 2017 and 2018, police killed more unarmed whites (20 and 24) than blacks (18 and 19).  So, as I said, mid-double digits.  You can argue that on a per capita basis, there are more blacks, but if you factor in the fact that more blacks commit crimes and have more police interactions than whites, you're still left with the fact that we're talking about less than 100 people a year of all races, in a country of 340 million.

The police are attacking completely innocent and peaceful individuals. They are full of god complex obsessed losers who's only available avenue for power was to be a cop. They use their power unfairly against everyone.   It has been disproportionate to black people with being pulled over, harassed and harsher sentencing against black.   The bottom line is the all this is proving, violence is only okay when done by the police which is hypocrisy.

I don't need a measurement because I'm not using a measurement. I'm saying that the status quo in America 50 years ago was that segregation was okay to do and that the Civil Rights Act didn't magically cause all white Americans to wake up and realize how racist it was in one day.

When someone calls someone else the n-word, that has nothing to do with the victim's failings. It has everything to do with the former person being racist:  https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/08/donald-trump-johnstown-pennsylvania-supporters-215800  America has a history of racism and we can see remnants of it such as the KKK, the Jim Crow laws and separate but equal facilities. These incidents were mostly carried out by white Americans because they've made up most of the population back then and still do today. The privilege part about it comes from the fact that pro-white events such as KKK rallies will be extremely disturbing to American minorities, yet white Americans know that those crazy people won't go after them as they are the same color. Minorities can be racist, but by the fact that they collectively only make 25% of Americans, they lack of size and power that organized white racists have with groups such as the KKK or white nationalist gatherings.  It's not about saying that minorities are perfect, but that being part of the largest racial group in America shields you from more race-related incidents than if you were a minority person. That's the idea here."

They have a tendency of covering for the bad cops in question.   &gt;And here's the data to back up the fact that blacks are more likely to be shot by a black cop than a white one:  And here's a link from an actual reputable site showing there is no difference between black and white cops: https://www.npr.org/2019/07/26/745731839/new-study-says-white-police-officers-are-not-more-likely-to-shoot-minority-suspe  Not that it matters as it still shows that black men are disproportionately targeted so this goal shifting you're doing is cute.   &gt;None of this points to ""systematic racism"". Quite the opposite, it shows that, on the whole, police are fairly restrained in this country.  Not if you actually do your research: https://www.statista.com/chart/amp/21857/people-killed-in-police-shootings-in-the-us/ https://www.arrestrecords.com/infographic-racism-in-the-criminal-justice-system/  This isn't getting into deaths outside of shootings. Police choke and beat people to death pretty regularly, and they've even been known to starve a person to death: https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/13/us/washington-woman-dies-in-jail-lawsuit/index.html"

For shampoos and shower gels it involves special ingredients like plant extracts and whatnot...  But of course, special design that needs to be developed and marketed also plays a role - as someone needs to be paid for all those things.

Similarly most advances for women since have been due t several inventions, all be men... better medicine for pregnancy and childbirth, contraception, modern toilets, modern female sanitary products, abortion.... of course women did huge amounts to change sterotypes of women, as did men... but the idea that men blocked women rights is entirely false (the literally created ones women could not even imagine by inventing e.g. contraception or modern sanitary products, contraception)  And those suffragette actions almost put the vote to jeopardy.

Just like white people stood along side black slaves to free them. An oppressed group often cannot change society and culture without help from some of the groups in power.

That’s how long it took *white women*. Men were voting for over 130 years before white women were allowed to vote.   1789: States limited the right to vote to property-owning or tax-paying white males (about 6% of the population).   1792–1838: Free black males *lose* the right to vote in several Northern states   1856: all white men have the right to vote regardless of status  1870: The Fifteenth Amendment prevents states from denying the right to vote on grounds of ""race, color, or previous condition of servitude"". All men can vote.   &gt;Former Confederate states passed Jim Crow laws and amendments to effectively disfranchise black and poor white voters through poll taxes, literacy tests, grandfather clauses and other restrictions, applied in a discriminatory manner. During this period, the Supreme Court generally upheld state efforts to discriminate against racial minorities; only later in the 20th century were these laws ruled unconstitutional. Black males in the Northern states could vote, but the majority of African Americans lived in the South.  1887: Native Americans technically eligible to vote who are willing to disassociate themselves from their tribe   1920: white women get the right to vote. In practice, the same restrictions that hindered the ability of non-white men to vote now also applied to non-white women.  1952: All Asian Americans can vote  1962: all native Americans have the right to vote  &gt;in USA men decided to give women the vote while they dont have to sign up to the draft or bucket brigrade.

SonnBaz,2020-06-02 08:30:39,fsm7u3m,t3_guwgtg,t3_guwgtg,I would be pleasantly surprised if I didn't know it's because they don't see this as a men's issue and are doing this because it's a black issue.
mhandanna,2020-06-02 09:03:32,fsm9v1d,t3_guwgtg,t1_fslihz6,Feminism is a politial ideoalgy. Its not the same as womens rights. To oppose the former has absolutely nothing to do with the latter. In fact many egalatrias reject feminism for that reason.
mhandanna,2020-06-02 09:06:55,fsma2cp,t3_guwgtg,t1_fsm1qrx,People experssing their opinion is not whining... telling people shut up up because I dont like it and I am right so shut up I am right wahhh wahhh I am right.... yeah thats whining.  Lol man up... you sound like the same vegan soy latte drinker that tells men they need to express themselves more and be woke and not have toxic masculinity... of course only to a narrow set of views you approve of
AmuseDeath,2020-06-02 09:15:10,fsmakbp,t3_guwgtg,t1_fsl41bp,"Ah yes, the ""not all of us are crazy"" argument.  The problem with this is that your leaders in charge have done horrible, horrible things. This is what we define you as until you denounce these people:  https://old.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/7s832j/dont_worry_a_man_will_clean_it_up/dt34lgm/  And of course you don't address the completely false things that feminism teaches. No economist takes the wage gap seriously. We don't live in a rape culture; we punish rapes and we even incarcerate those accused of rape without proof. The male gaze is a load of crock when women ""female gaze"" at men all the time. No, men back then didn't have it great; men who weren't in power did all of the backbreaking work, acted as cannonfodder in wars and were poor and died from disease.  The myth that all men are privileged completely ignores the issues that men face such as high suicides, high workplace deaths, historic lower life expectancy and higher homeless numbers. Feminists never concede the fact that more women than men are in college, nor are they concerned with the fact that boys are being left behind in elementary school. Men are the majority of all homicides, men are more likely to suffer from solitary depression and they lack resources such as shelters that women enjoy. And even homeless shelters for women are much better in quality than are the ones for men, despite men making more of this population.  False rape accusation numbers are hard to find, but FBI numbers and police anecdotes have said the number is between 10-40%:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNTc5xpiiv8&amp;feature=emb_title  Feminism has spread into gaming and digital media. There is talk about the oversexualization of women in these places, yet this discounts the fact that many women are okay with it and some even draw that sort of art. Feminists complain about how women have oversexualized depictions, yet there are plenty of women okay with this and of course there are women in the adult industry. Feminists cannot accept that women have different opinions. They think that all women must agree with them or they have internal misogyny. That logic ironically is sexist.  Feminists often complain about porn, yet women in porn are paid very well and do this voluntarily. They are paid more than their male counterparts:  https://www.revelist.com/career/average-porn-salaries/851  And of course Serena Williams had a recent fit with a tennis judge who said she was cheating by getting hand signals from her coach and she chalked it up to gender discrimination. Yet, her coach actually admitted to the cheating:  https://thefederalist.com/2018/09/10/serena-williams-caught-cheating-now-crying-sexism/  Many feminists are against the legalization of prostitution when the majority of sex workers in legalized countries state that work is enjoyable and it has made their jobs safer:  https://www.thesun.co.uk/living/1197602/prostitute-who-earns-2000-a-week-reveals-the-average-size-of-her-customers-and-how-much-she-enjoys-her-work/  https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/the-majority-of-sex-workers-enjoy-their-job-why-should-we-find-that-surprising-10083175.html  So as you can see, there are the worst types of people on the top, legislating sexist bullshit against men. Then you have the minions on the bottom saying that, ""We're not like that!"". It's as if some Nazis were to say that Hitler doesn't represent them. The main issue with feminism is that it is a flawed movement. It is not based on facts or reality, but theories that are designed to suppress counter-think and focus the gun on men. Even if you aren't into gender politics, anyone who is for reason, data and facts has to be against feminism because they don't use those things.  Men's Rights focuses on men's issues. They do this by looking at data and facts which are quantifiable things. Saying that 3/4s of all suicides are men is a fact. It's undisputable and unbiased. The female equivalent of Men's Rights isn't feminism; it's Women's Rights. These people would be fighting for women's issues using facts and data instead of feminist malarky.  Yes, not all feminist are psychos who pull fire-alarms, but the fact is that feminism isn't just a focus on women's issues. It injects all sorts of false theories and has techniques to squash any forms of critical thinking or criticism. Feminists love to run around saying that they are the only way for gender equality, yet many women do not agree with them. Any person who disagrees with feminism must be a misogynist, even if you are another woman.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=6&amp;v=iARHCxAMAO0  The truth is you can be for gender equality and you definitely don't need to be feminist. We need to use data and facts to solve gender issues, not theories and magic. We need to be open-minded and rational and not shut down anyone who is different. Feminism is the definition of anti-logic and hivemind think. It is akin to Scientology that also practices the same techniques."
AmuseDeath,2020-06-02 09:20:01,fsmauu1,t3_guwgtg,t1_fslihz6,Except we're not because we don't agree with the bullshit theories that feminist preaches. Feminists are just confused people.

They need to be about reason and critical thinking instead of quashing different voices. They need to denounce their leaders who have created sexist policies against men:  https://old.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/7s832j/dont_worry_a_man_will_clean_it_up/dt34lgm/  They need to stop blaming men for anything bad in their lives and take responsibility:  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2794851-serena-williams-coach-admits-to-coaching-during-us-open-final-amid-controversy

Twitter needs to protect women from this kind of hate speech.  A few weeks ago I posted a tweet to comment on the newly released photographs of the internationally acclaimed singer Adele, who has gone from a kick-ass body-positive well-rounded figure to an attenuated sliver of her former self. It goes without saying that such drastic weight loss sends a terrible message to People of Girth (POGs). As I pointed out in my tweet, by losing weight Adele is guilty of fat-shaming her younger self. Needless to say, I was subjected to a torrent of abuse merely for speaking my truth. Adele fans the world over were insisting that her choices were hers alone. I do agree that women should be able to do whatever they want, so long as it is approved by intersectional feminists."

Men's rights have been blatantly ignored and we have been shunned into small corners of the internet to be able to speak about the day to day sexism we receive. We can't even talk about our rights in public without feminists coming out and calling us sexist. ""Kill all men"" and stuff like that is what we hear day to day because feminists think it is acceptable. So no, Feminism is not about egalitarians. If it was, they would have included men in all the issues they were fighting for. Feminism is more about power and control, especially to push men further down and take advantage of in a world where they are already thought of as disposable."

Since in the end, people self identifies as feminists or not, it would be an infringement on their right to lump them all together. Just cause they lump all MRAs together, both are wrong. It scares me that MRA are on the right now, but to fight the evils of feminism, many MRAs can become sore and become the enemy they want to fight. That is exactly what happened to feminism.

What she fails to understand (as you do), is that foundation in which feminism is based on is problematic in the first place. That's why I, as rational person cannot accept any forms of feminism because it goes against facts and data. If a person wants to focus on women's issues using logic and reason, they can do so as a women's rights activist. That's the idea.   You don't need to be feminist to fight for women's issues. You don't need to be feminist to promote gender equality. Women that are not feminist don't have internalized misogyny as feminism claims. Women can think differently and for themselves.  As far as that picture goes, I just see a woman helping out some injured people. That's a good act in itself and has nothing to do with feminism.

Racists back in the day referred to ethnic minorities as colored people, and now intersectional feminists use that same exact expression except this time it's in passive voice as person of color, rather than in active voice. Much in the same way your predecessors reduced people to nothing except unmeasured, arbitrary states of being (black, male, poor, disabled, etc.), it's still done today and enabled by useful (albeit well-intentioned) people. So, I agree with you about it evolving. Unfortunately for you, that evolution still has not shaved a lot of the supremacy sentiments that permeate throughout your religion.  If you wish to continue to defend an ideology founded on ideas of supremacy, you're free to die on that hill. I traded up to egalitarianism. Much more inclusive, and we actually kick out the faux-egals. Feminists are cool with turning a blind eye to their ideology's abhorrent activities. This point proven by how you're perfectly willing to accept, defend, and shill for an ideology founded on bigotry. If you're going to continue to jam the feminist label down the throats of egalitarians (you know, acting like a supremacy ideology), don't be surprised when your religion is labelled a supremacy religion. Actions speak louder than words.  So don't talk to me like I'm a fucking idiot, guy. I know more about feminism than you do."

Koss and many, many others...)  That's why I hate the ideology that got them there ;). But sure, prove to me that all these major feminist organizations are working for equality. I am still waiting for the 'violence against men act' to be pushed by feminist organizations, as I already asked you to provide me with their efforts to do so days ago.  But sure, I am the racist and sexist here :D Lol, you pathetic disingenuous troll...

Niki_Biryani,2020-06-02 16:41:50,fsnfob9,t3_guwgtg,t1_fsn4vm0,"Those are some non-sense link you shared. Feminism has contributed to more laws made against men and more discrimination against men. Currently, men are largely discriminated against in almost every field because of feminists. Almost all research is against whatever you just posted above. Maybe educate yourself on men's issues before spouting that non-sense feminist talking points?  Edit: The more I read that article the more frustrated I get. Men's sexual liberation didn't happen. most feminists were against it. Most laws feminists passed were discriminatory against men. Men got less reproductive rights due to feminists and the divorce rape was made possible due to feminists. Feminists actually advocated to not include men as rape victims. Due to feminists, men are STILL not counted as rape victims. Feminist professor Mary P Koss who help make the rape laws openly said men can't be raped and openly advocated for the rape of men. Men still have to work more hours at work because of feminism (Men were not liberated by feminists). Almost everything posted in that article is downright idiotic and shameful. It makes me frustrated that feminists after actively fighting against all of those things now claim that they are the ones who accomplished that.  Maybe that is why everyone hates feminists on how hypocrite they are?"

LXXXVI,2020-06-02 19:10:09,fsnykm3,t3_guwgtg,t1_fsn4vm0,"Comments on the points from the first link:  &gt; 1. It gave our economy a huge, long-lasting boost.  It doubled the supply of work while it didn't get even close to doubling the demand for it. That's why once upon a time single-earner families could afford stuff that now double-earner couples can't. I'm all for women working, but don't pretend like this was a benefit for men.  &gt; 3. It successfully overturned laws that discriminate against men.  And created a bunch of new ones that do.  &gt; 5. It expanded the possibility of more sexy time opportunities.  If they're rich/handsome enough. For the ""bottom"" 80%, I'd argue it's harder than ever to find a good mate.  &gt; 6. It gave men more reproductive control through abortion legalization.  They misspelled women. Men have about as much reproductive control as a house slave did about his living arrangement - at the pleasure of the person with actual power. Once they support paper abortion, however...  &gt; 7. It triggered the FBI to change the definition of rape to include men.  ""The new definition now includes all forms of penetration and no longer excludes men.""  Until it includes ""made to penetrate"" it absolutely does exclude men.  &gt; 8. It gave men some well-deserved time off from work.  The entire US is barbaric when it comes to time off, not to mention the abominable concept of ""sick days"". Also, as it says in the article, it wasn't that they fought for men to have this, they just didn't actively exclude them. It was targeted primarily at women.  &gt; 10. It ensured that the burden of war doesn't only fall on male shoulders.  The burden of war falls on male shoulders until the draft includes women.  &gt; 11. It made the struggle for civil rights a reality.  How dare you appropriate black women's contributions to the civil rights movement, when they're precisely the group feminism all too often de-facto excludes. Women =/= feminism!  &gt; 13. It enabled men to spend more time with their children.  They fought for that because they were trying to free women from the stereotypical stay-at-home role, not because they wanted fathers to connect with their kids. No credit for side-effects.  &gt; 14. It expanded the definition of hate crimes to include all identities.  Except straight, white, and/or male.  &gt; 17. It built a more inclusive world, one feminist celebrity at a time.  All well and good, but this was done for the LGBTQ community, not for men.  &gt; 18. It protected men's precious marbles during sports.  It was a woman inventor, not a feminist inventor. Also, since they BS about ""Without feminism, female inventors would have never been able to leave the kitchen to create things that many men use every day"" just about all of Slavic Europe never had anything like a ""feminist movement"" and yet women's rights there have been so far ahead of the west for most of the post WW2 era that it's not even funny.  &gt; 19. It made men's lives better and happier.  And we'll believe that as soon as the suicide statistics for men show proper improvement.  &gt; 20. It demanded that the media change its representation of men.  That must be why the feminist Ghost Busters cast Chris Hemsworth. They didn't want to push stereotypes.  &gt; 21. It fought for men's right to become nurses and teachers.  How many scholarships exclusively for men exist for nursing and teaching training? How many campaigns to get men into that? Compared to all the effort put into getting women into high-paid positions, this is literally a drop in the ocean.  &gt; 22. It encouraged men to rethink outdated masculinity standards.  You mean it associated the words masculinity and toxicity and did its best to make men feel bad about being men.  &gt; 23. It pushed for immigration reform to help countless American families.  They SAY it's about women primarily, so why pretend this is about men?  ---  Seriously, nobody's denying that there are some positive trickle-down effects feminist policy now and then has on men, but all in all it's harmful AF and this kind of gaslighting is Trump-level."

Its not a random feminists. Its a 30 year tenured professor, EDITOR of gender journal, head of her department with leadership roles in university (which the author even discusses, how the heck can she be an open misandrist and openly want to see less men in power yet actively have leadership roles and decide hiring?) and who writes in Washngton Post etc (she wrote why cant we just hate men) You cannot distrance yourself from her. SHE IS FEMINISM. Actually read her interview. She is  an utter hate filled misandrist. SHE IS LEADER AT UNIVERSITY, A  PROFESSOR, AUTHOR, EDITOR\*\* .... why are feminsits not distanceing  themselves away from her? Why has no one complained about her? She hires  people yet she says she wants to remove all men in power? She has  leadership posts?  **Christina Hoff Sommers put it brilliantly. She says sometimes ""radicals"" correcting an imbalance can take it too far but be right in essence and justified in their extreme actions especially if the nothing is available to them for change, e.g. civil rights. in the past.... she says however, feminists are not in this category... they are not right in the head, they are a cult, they are ideologies so when they take it to far there is no justification. They are a mob**  Anyway back to the point, this feminists apologist made... no this feminists cannot make that argument, as they NOW are main feminists body... they are feminism through and though... his/her point about them being driven by money and ideology is  very true, and that is much of feminism e.g. the domestic violence industry, why uni tolerates feminism, books sales, authors etc, just making stuff up for Money and doing things they know dont work and actually makes it worse for women... just for money... however that isn't NOT feminism... it is feminism... feminism is corrupt movement, there's money, academic fraud and all sorts and then there is hate  I dont say it lightly, Ive released though loads of reashaerch and actually learning from feminists and ex feminists, the appeal for many is simply they have personal, social, psychological issues and feminism is the crutch to help them... it really does appeal to deluded and psychologically lacking people... if feminism didn't exists, they'd be just as deluded, they'd just pick a differ religious cult"

She was the one wrote the ""why cant we just hate men"" in washtingtin post.  [https://recalculatingthegenderwar.tumblr.com/post/175624749301/feminist-professor-who-wrote-why-cant-we-hate](https://recalculatingthegenderwar.tumblr.com/post/175624749301/feminist-professor-who-wrote-why-cant-we-hate)  Actually read her interview. She is an utter hate filled misandrist. SHE IS LEADER AT UNIVERSITY, A PROFESSOR, AUTHOR, EDITOR\*\* .... why are feminsits not distanceing themselves away from her? Why has no one complained about her? She hires people yet she says she wants to remove all men in power? She has leadership posts?  I have moved away from thinking feminism has corrup elements to realising the whole movement is at its core a hate movement and a cult. This is feminsim.  \*\* and you're posting a random conversation of a person on the internet who would have no power. You talk about spreading terror? LMAO. Compared to what? A feminsit who will probably reach what over a million people with her misandry.  Read her interivew, she is mentally ill, you are part of that movement. This is feminism  lol at posting a screenshot from who knows where. Go on Gender crtical, black pill feminism, Female dating strategy.  Also you acknlwedge men have issues. LMAO. Here is what she says:  Do you believe it’s possible to be sexist against men?  No, I really don’t. Sexism is about the institutionalized and interpersonal treatment of women and people perceived to be women. Again, look at the world. Where is discrimination? Where are men being excluded? Where are men being abused? Oh, come on.”  ## Walters is feminist clergy.  There were many hard questions  that didn’t get asked in this interview. For example, how can Walters be  trusted to have a leadership position at the university when she wants  to remove men from positions of power? Any application or hiring process  she touches is now a possible gender discrimination lawsuit.  Regardless,  Walters confirms almost all my common assertions about modern feminism.  She tries to conceal her obvious bigotry toward men behind verbose  language and jargon. She believes men are made a demonic force in  society by a mysterious, ill-defined ""patriarchy”. She blames men as  group for the actions of an evil minority of men, even though most men  would find those actions abhorrent. She makes reckless claims using  uncited data that may not even exist. She cares more about the societal  dominance of feminism than the actual representation or advancement of  women. She unnecessarily binds feminism to support of left-wing  politics.  Walters so perfectly validates so many criticisms of  modern feminism that defenders of feminism like Friedersdoft cannot  accept she isn’t some of straw man invented to discredit it. However,  Walters impressive feminist credentials are impossible to deny. She  cannot be brushed off as “radical” or “fringe”. She is only a “radical”  feminist in the same way a bishop is a “radical” Christian. She teaches  the faith, she guides its adherents, she writes the scripture, she  controls the direction of the ideology.  Walters’ misandry is the  natural response to fully accepting feminist ideology and embracing the  patriarchal dominance theory that is at its core. She isn’t a fluke. She  is feminism’s successful end product and she, like so many others, is  being paid to make more just like her."

Your heads are too far up your own asses to even understand something so basic. This isn't a defence of Feminism and only an idiot would claim it is without even attempting to look at my post history or at least asking where I stand and talking to me like a human being. Feminism is part of the main powers of society, it has so much pull that it's disgusting. But if you think their motivations is something so basic as hating men then you're an idiot. They don't care about womens issues anymore than big mega church leaders care about their religion. This is about money and power, plain and simple. Just like it is for any big corporation regardless of their message. This isn't saying they aren't true whatever's, this is basic common sense. For if the dual parenting bill passed, NoW would take a big dip in profits since they make a lot helping woman take a man for everything in custody cases. If shared parenting is the default what do you think happens? Feminism is like religion, and religion is about controlling the ignorant, and/or the vulnerable, and making money off of them.   Honestly not sure how people can be so stupid as to not understand something so basic and instead take it as some form of defence for an ideology. You people are so warped in tribal warfare that you can't even see the most basic of logic if it hit you in the head, and instead think it's somehow a defence for Feminism.   And it's hilarious that you of all people try to claim I make that fallacy. You have no sense of irony whatsoever."

I fully agree with you on this, and many people know this too... in fact the entire anti postmodernist movement knows this.  Yes feminism is a religion, and the problems ARE NOT unique to feminism, all cults have the same issue, and these people just as easily could have been members of another form of  extremism. And remmeber most of aacademic feminsim is linked to marxism (in fact when marxism collapsed, there was panic and the people just moved to feminism, and other greivence studies so thats why feminism collapsing is not the asnwer too, these cult member will go onto something else just as bad)  I think you know this, but you haven't quite said it, at the top yes that is their motivation, the power and corruption, just as the fake megachurch is... at the bottom, the suckers (the everyday feminstis, the morons on here defending it) believe this crap genunely.  As I said what you described about NOW this is the motivation of the domestic violence industry, much of feminsits NGOs and charaties etc.  These problems are not even exclusive to feminsim, NOT AT ALL its in many movements, its also a wider problem in the charity sector.  Also the hatred and delusion that feminists have is the same in other cults and hate ideaologies... you could just as easily radicalse that feminist into some other hate idealogy.  BUT REMEMBER, yes its power, but at the top many do believe their crap too  **Thats why defeting feminism is not as simple as defeating feminism. You need to** defeat the mindest and this gullibailty to be radcialsed.... something called Bildung, is a Nordic method of teaching... a comprehensive teaching method like that is good as it stops this modern education problem where people dont know how to think, just what to think hence they are suckers for any kind of radicalisation whether relilgious, feminism, even MRA, incels etc.  Feminism appeals on many psycholigcal levels. The people who are so have many psycholoical flaws and feminism fills that void, just as other ideoalogies could do. Now many feminsits can just be wrong, and feminism doesnt really affect them too much.... but most acdemic feminists from university have deep psychological issues which feminism tries to help and masks"

lol1969,2020-06-03 13:54:32,fsqwezy,t3_gviqhs,t1_fsqgaj0,"2000s On August 4, 2009, George Sodini opened fire at an LA Fitness health club in Collier Township, a suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Three women died and nine other people were injured before Sodini killed himself. He purportedly expressed sexual frustration and complained of constant rejections by women on a website registered in his name. In the years following the shooting, Sodini has been embraced by some incel communities.  2010s Elliot Rodger killed six people and injured fourteen others before killing himself in Isla Vista, California on May 23, 2014, near the campus of University of California, Santa Barbara. These killings drew media attention to the concept of involuntary celibacy, and particularly the misogyny and glorification of violence that are a mainstay of many incel communities. Rodger self-identified as an incel and left behind a 137-page manifesto and YouTube videos in which he detailed his involuntary celibacy and discussed how he wanted revenge for being rejected by women. He had been an active member of a community popular among incels called PUAHate (short for ""pickup artist hate""), and referenced it several times in his manifesto. Although PUAHate shut down soon after the attack, Rodger became something of a martyr to some communities that remained, and to some of those that emerged later. He has been referenced by the perpetrators or suspected perpetrators of several other mass killings, and is one of several attackers who are regularly praised by members of incel communities.  Chris Harper-Mercer killed nine people and injured eight others before killing himself in a shooting at the Umpqua Community College campus on October 1, 2015 in Roseburg, Oregon. He left a manifesto at the scene, outlining his interest in other mass murders including the Isla Vista killings, his anger at not having a girlfriend, and his animus towards the world. In his journal writings, he had related with Elliot Rodger and other mass shooters, describing them as ""people who stand with the gods"". Before the attack, when someone on an online message board had speculated Harper-Mercer was ""saving himself for someone special"", Harper-Mercer had replied: 'involuntarily so."" Several hours before the shooting, someone suspected to be Harper-Mercer posted a threat to a Pacific Northwest college to /r9k/, a 4chan board with many incel posters.  On July 31, 2016, Sheldon Bentley robbed and killed an unconscious man in an alleyway in Edmonton, Alberta. During his trial, Bentley said he killed the man by stomping on his abdomen because he was frustrated with stress from his job as a security guard and with being involuntarily celibate for four years.  William Atchison killed two people before killing himself on December 7, 2017 in Aztec, New Mexico, in a shooting at Aztec High School, where he had previously been a student. He had used the pseudonym ""Elliot Rodger"" on several online forums, and praised ""the supreme gentleman"" (a term Rodger had used to describe himself, which has since become a common reference among incel communities).  On February 14, 2018, Nikolas Cruz killed seventeen people and injured seventeen others in a shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, before being arrested. Cruz had previously posted online that ""Elliot Rodger will not be forgotten"".  Alek Minassian killed ten people and injured fourteen others on April 23, 2018 in a vehicle-ramming attack in Toronto, Ontario before being arrested. Shortly before the attack, Minassian had posted on Facebook that ""the Incel Rebellion has already begun"" and applauded Rodger. The term ""Incel Rebellion"" is sometimes used interchangeably with the term ""Beta Uprising"", which refers to a violent response to incels' perceived sexual deprivation. Following the attack, a poster on a website created to supersede /r/incels wrote about Minassian, ""I hope this guy wrote a manifesto because he could be our next new saint."" Following the attack, police found that Minassian had been radicalized by incel communities. Minassian told police that he was a virgin, and that the attack had been motivated by his resentment for ""chads and stacys"", as well as for women who ""g[ave] their love and affection to obnoxious brutes"" rather than to him. He said that he hoped his attack would ""inspire future masses to join me"" in committing acts of violence as a part of the ""Beta Uprising"".  On November 2, 2018, Scott Beierle killed two women and injured four women and a man before killing himself in a shooting at the Hot Yoga Tallahassee studio in Tallahassee, Florida. He had been a follower of incel ideologies for a long time, and also had a history of arrests for grabbing women's buttocks. In 2014 he posted several YouTube videos of himself espousing extreme hatred for women and expressing anger over not having a girlfriend, mentioning Elliot Rodger in one video. In the months leading up to the shooting, he posted numerous misogynistic, racist, violent, and homophobic songs to SoundCloud.  In January 2019, Christopher Cleary was arrested for posting on Facebook that he was ""planning on shooting up a public place soon and being the next mass shooter"" and ""killing as many girls as I see"" because he had never had a girlfriend and was a virgin. He has been described as an incel in the media. In May 2019, Cleary was sentenced to up to five years in prison for an attempted threat of terrorism.  Bryan Isaack Clyde began what was intended to be a mass shooting at the Earle Cabell Federal Building and Courthouse in Dallas, Texas on June 17, 2019, but was shot and fatally wounded by officers from the Federal Protective Service before he injured anyone. Clyde had shared incel memes on social media, along with other posts referencing right-wing beliefs and conspiracy theories. Following the incident, the Joint Base Andrews military base briefed its personnel on incels, with a spokesman describing them as ""a very real threat to military members and civilians.""  Incels have also praised attackers with unclear motives who they believe to be incels. After the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, some of the incel community celebrated the shooter Stephen Paddock, who they felt was a hero who was targeting ""normies"". After the 2018 Toronto shooting, posters on an incel message board expressed excitement with the possibility that the perpetrator might be an incel, although no motive has been identified.  2020s Tobias Rathjen committed two mass shootings in Hanau, Germany on February 19, 2020, killing ten people and himself, and leaving behind a manifesto described by Insider as ""delusional"". Some media sources reported that Rathjen self-identified as an incel in the manifesto; others said that he did not use the term. The manifesto included racist and paranoid writings, where Rathjen called for the extermination of non-white people and claimed he had not had a relationship with a woman because the government had been monitoring him.  On February 24, 2020, a 17-year-old male stabbed a female spa worker to death and attempted to kill her female coworker at an erotic massage parlor in Toronto. On May 19, the Toronto Police Service declared the murder was being treated as a terrorist incident after evidence pointed to the attack being motivated by incel ideology. This was the first time violence motivated by incel ideologies was prosecuted as an act of terrorism, and is also believed to be the first act of violence not perpetrated by an Islamist extremist to be prosecuted as terrorism in Canada.  Armando Hernandez Jr. opened fire on May 20, 2020 at Westgate Entertainment District, a mixed-use development in Glendale, Arizona, before being arrested by police. A 19-year-old man was critically injured, while a 30-year-old woman and a 16-year-old girl suffered minor injuries. According to the Maricopa County prosecutor, Hernandez identified himself as an incel and claimed he wanted to target couples and shoot at least ten people."

Its complicated, but what you are describing is what people need to know about feminism and society in general... that way people wont become extremists in anything feminism, mra, marxism, capitalism etc. People need to have more awareness of how much feminsits bull crap especially in universiy comes from neo marxist supporters, and most of these are actually men, also be hijkacking LGBT as well and politisicing it  Feminism is an extreme problem at the moment since it is so pervasive and so tolerated. I am sure it will pass as post moderinism crumbles. MRAs need t be careful we dont end up like feminists, but I doubt we will, not only is the movement based more so on facts and rationale, it doesnt have all sorts of idelaogy driving it like feminsim has.  Incels etc are complete false flag and something else entirely, as is other disntinct things like MGTOW or PUA"

Simialry what has incels got to do with me or MRA?   I refer to feminism as that is what you are and what we are talking about... theres no hiding from feminisms cult like religion, its violence, the death it has cause and its social destruction... it is not an isolated feautre of it, its not sepratists... it comes form its core, its leaders and its followers  And here is an example of feminsim at the UN level causing death, and even ironically harming women (as feminism usually does):  https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/gvkgom/post_earthquake_un_fed_only_females_used_violence/"

I have heard this counterargument to Egalitarianism - especially from spirituals - too many times to count.   My response to this has always been that ""meant to be"" and ""should be"" are very different, and often at odds with each other. There is a lot of inequality because nature screwed things up, but hey, it was ""meant to be"" - but only the mind and heart (and to a degree, soul) can decide what is right and wrong, and knows things ""should"" be different. For another example, guns were ""meant to"" kill, ""should"" they? Actually, in that instance it all depends on the circumstances, I guess...     Incidentally, on weapons and violence, personally I find the world (especially here in the US) as backwards as it gets. The police and military ""should be"" enforcing equality under orders of a government that upholds - quite frankly - iron-fisted Egalitarian policies. Yet, in countries like the US, only men (or anyone with two balls and a penis, whatever they may identify as) are conscripted... and many (but not all) of the police forces are turning out to be racists. Disappointing...     I can't really say that I am Feminist or MRA (and btw, if you view this post above then you know this is sarcasm - how could you not considering the source?) as either side puts the spotlight exclusively on their respective sex, which takes it away from the other. Egalitarianism includes both sexes, all genders, and other groups - or at least it ""should"".     Equality is Equality, not exclusively WRA or MRA... but it might not be until the 21XX (next century) until people stop being egoist and start wanting to look beyond to help others.

His bread and butter appear to be ""ignore what you said and focus on what he sees as important"" (you've learned how to mimic that one well) combined with ""try to harass people via parody of what he perceives they've done to him"" which I simply don't view as very effective.  I'm curious if the differing preference of trolling strategy belies an interest in targeting different audience sensitivities? Do people react with different kinds of lul when harassed via different means, or does it alter the population of who you can debate-catfish?  I have noticed that strategies like appeal to purity aren't ideology or gender specific though, so anyone who wants to troll feminists can carry the same torch.

Mr-X1,2020-06-04 20:40:03,fswenxt,t3_gwlocw,t1_fsvocr1,"&gt; BUT for some unknown reason, police officers made the conscious decision to murder nearly 3 times as many black women who posed no threat to their lives than white men.  If you kill 500 white men, and 20% of those were unarmed, then you killed 100 unarmed white men (should be doable before breakfast). If you then also kill 50 black women, and let's say 60% of those were unarmed, you killed 30 unarmed black women (still doable). You obviously killed more unarmed white men than unarmed black women. The seemingly strange percentage difference can probably be explained via the low total number of black women who got murdered by the police.  Let us do some basic reasoning: 1700 deaths. 94% are men. So 1598. That leaves us with 102 non-male deaths. Subtract white women, who are a way bigger part of the population than black women, asian etc women, transgender etc people, etc. What do you think how many black women are even left? Now how many of those have been killed unarmed while being at a scene of violence or during a raid on e.g. a potentially armed (probably often but not always black+male) family member? Those low numbers and the scenarios I provided alone can probably explain the seemingly weird percentage number that you got hung up on."

On top of that, more black men are killed while unarmed than white men too. Your explanation does not factor in racial bias against black people."

Who said that this justifies anything? I just pointed out that the massiveness of the percentage difference is explainable this way.  &gt; On top of that, more black men are killed while unarmed than white men too.  I am sure that is true (percentage wise at least). And some of it will be due to racism, and some of it will be due to some of the things I mentioned. And I am pretty sure those latter things are even more dangerous for black men than black women because they are seen as more of a threat.  &gt; Your explanation does not factor in racial bias against black people.  Your point? I merely explained how that percentage number for black women is so much higher than for white men without that necessarily being particularly meaningful. Nothing I said goes against other studies, which show that black women are indeed -at least partially due to being black- more in danger than white women, but like all women massively less so than any male, especially black males.  So police violence is both a male and racial issue, with the racial part acting as a strong multiplier for the maleness factor for black men.

The fact that black women are more likely to be unarmed when killed by police than white people of both genders is more evidence that there is a tendency for police to murder black people when unarmed, it is evidence of an overwhelming racial bias. Black men are also much more likely than white men to be unarmed when murdered by cops. Taken together this means that the police tends to be biased and assume they are justified in murdering unarmed people when they are black, first and foremost. Black is what makes you more likely to be seen as a threat, even when you have no weapons. Your calculations do not dispute this.

Of course MRAs and egaltraisn aren;t feminsits, we are the ones saying dont gender things in the first palec. its femisnts who have the mindset (at governemtn and policy level e.g. in the UK today 1500 refuge beds just got appraoved 100% of them are female)  The stat you are looking for is (I was banned by feminism reddit just for posting the stats below)  Black men are 22x more likely to be killed than white men  Black women are 1.2x more likely to be killed than white women   Black men are about 20x more likely to be killed than white black women  95% of police deaths are male.  So wouldn't feminsts say we need to gender this?"

For myself, while obviously every life matters, BLM is more of a response to injustice against black folks and minorities against white racism and mistreatment in white-majority America.  And as someone who cares about men's issues, I don't feel pushing MLM makes sense. I'm just about getting the facts right and being fair to everybody. The reality is that people in this country and the planet really do not care for men's issues such as how men make the most of the suicides, the homicides, the homeless and the incarcerated. This due to how people are overly concerned for women's issues over men's, with women prioritizing women's issue 4 times over men's:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-group_favoritism#Automatic_bias_for_own_gender  The other aspect of it is the toxic movement that is feminism that promotes lies and misandry and accuses any women who isn't a feminist to have internal misogyny. This movement blames every problem on men (patriarchy) and its leaders have historically promoted anti-male legislation:  https://old.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/7s832j/dont_worry_a_man_will_clean_it_up/dt34lgm/  Feminism also tries to claim a monopoly on gender politics and says if you aren't a feminist, you are a sexist:  https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/news/a57173/gal-gadot-feminism/  The reality though is that you can be for women's rights without being a feminist and that's called being a women's rights activist. There's a huge difference between that and a feminist because WR would be supporting women's issues without all the lies, theories and misandry promoted by feminism. WR is the female equivalent of Men's Rights, as MR doesn't have the lies like the wage gap, the male gaze or rape culture.  Feminism says it's about gender equality when it actually isn't and we can see this with its leaders attacking men and how it basically blames everything on men. Feminism is sexist because it assumes all women have to be feminist or they are defective and have internal misogyny. They cannot allow women to think for themselves and be diverse. They think they are the only movement that supports women's issues or even both genders, when that's a lie because places like this one, egalitarianism exist.  Feminism is a cancer and is an abomination to logic and reason. Anyone who is educated and rational literally has to be against feminism as they are not guided by facts or data. Unfortunately feminism like the corona virus has infected the world with lies and hate and spun the narrative where if you criticize it, you are somehow a misogynist.

BLM is making something in the hundreds of millions of dollars, so the leaders of the movement are absolutely raking it in, meaning it’s leaders (There seems to be 8) have each made somewhere around 6 million dollars in the past month (if everything goes through Thousand Currents. In 2018 Thousand Currents made about 6.8 million dollars which would mean the leaders have made 200,000 each every year since about 2002.  Edit: fixed some numbers"

Again, source? I’ve seen sex negative feminists against robots, but everyone else basically says “good. This keeps them away from real women and will probably prevent violence against women. Why would we care if a man fucks a robot?”  &gt;Also the majority of men already want prostitution legalized, it's women who keep it illegal. And first wave feminists are the reason it became illegal in the first place.  Sources? Some people want it criminalized because they think it leads to trafficking, and because it can be dangerous. Some people want it *decriminalized* for the same reasons. Sex workers have no resources if they’re ever abused or raped or trafficked because if they go to the police they’ll be arrested.

It's in fact so important that we have to actively police it and hunt any trace of whatever could be misconstrued as gender (even though it doesn't come from that), and purge it, for fear it would influence how we think about some things.  But at the same time, it is the ideology that tries to convince us that the fact that everything bad according to it is named after men, and the force supposedly for equality being named after women is in fact purely coincidental and a result of some historical circumstances, but shouldn't be taken to heart and shouldn't be changed.   Feminism, patriarchy, mansplaining, toxic masculinity, manspreading, etc... All those are perfectly innocent, and anyone who gets the feeling that feminists want to imply that anything male is evil and to be purged are just wrong. And anyone who claims it might create issues in young people's views of masculinity are paranoid and deliberately misinterpreting the complex meaning behind those (as if a 4year old could understand that toxic masculinity doesn't actually mean that men are toxic)   But fireman, policeman or manpower, those are profoundly sexist and need governmental intervention to ensure people won't use them, for fear it would forever cripple the ability of young girl to see themselves in those roles, and anyone who objects that the ""man"" in those terms has nothing to do with masculinity, and everything to do with the latin/French root for hand is just a misogynist that is happy to ignore the fact that a 4 year old can't be expected to understand etymology.

If you want to know what feminist did against men's right, just see one of the men's right post dedicated to it.

mhandanna,2020-06-15 01:28:30,fuuvltv,t3_h913xz,t1_fuusnbq,"I haven't actually seen all of RP. However, the first guys video had a lot of bullshit in it. So I liked some of the stuff he said about stats e.g. divorce stats maybe trailing over decades (however, if we apply this logic almost all feminsits stats are also false e.g. 70% of medical students are female yet they keep banging on about not enough female x type of drs, that will change in a few years)  so given below info, Im not sure if most of what he says is actually bull too. He was also very wrong about feminsit having same issues as feminism is repeatdly blocking mens issues and also causing many (and causing women many problems too - remember feminism is about helping feminsits, NOT women, and that includes the money making aspect for feminsit e.g. white ribbon 100% of money goes to femintis 0% went to female DV victims, then all the DV industry etc)  Anyway, where he was very wrong was what MRAs do. So 1 simple rebuttal is this:  Common fake argument about MRAs is  they are keyboard warriors who just want to critiscise feminism and have  done nothing for men. The truth is that could not be further from the  truth, and that is what frightens feminists - even limited resources  MRAs are extremely productive, changing laws, winning court cases daily,  even going to the UN, European Court of Human Rights, Other courts and  winning time and time again. When it enivitably becomes a major movement  its power will be enormous.  **Here's some UK victories of just one MRA group:**  In  summary, because of these MRA actions, every single male citizen in the  UK - you, your dad, your grandad, your husband, as well as their  wives/husbands, sons, daughters etc... has benifited and will always do  so in the future from these social provisions (free bus travel, free  prescriptions) that were previously denied to men for aboslutely no  basis apart from male sex and given to women for no reason apart from  female sex. This has amounted to billions of dollars.  Note:  all of the below are because women retire at 60 and men at 65 - and  women then get a whole host of benifits at 60 that men don't get (until  MRAs campagned and won to get them at 60 too like women - although they  stil retire at age 65), such as:  **Prescription charges**  Parity's first major success began in 1993 under its original name, when CESPA member Cyril Richardson, an [asthmatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthmatic), took the government to court over sex discrimination in entitlement for free [prescriptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_drug).[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(charity)#cite_note-12)[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(charity)#cite_note-autogenerated3-13)   Eventually, in 1995 the European Court of Justice ruled that it was  unlawful to charge men aged 60–65 for prescriptions when they were free   to women. As a result, men now receive benefits in the order of an   estimated £30 million per annum. Additionally, £10 million in charges   was refunded to those who had wrongly paid for prescriptions in the   previous 3 months before the ruling.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(charity)#cite_note-14)[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(charity)#cite_note-15)  **Winter fuel payments**  In 1998 Parity member John Taylor went to the [High Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice) to contest the fact that the government was denying [winter fuel payments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_fuel_payment)   to men aged 60–65 that women were able to receive. It was argued that   this was a breach of European laws on equality in social security,[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(charity)#cite_note-16) and that such discrimination was blatant and unjustifiable.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(charity)#cite_note-autogenerated1-11)[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(charity)#cite_note-17) The case was referred to the [European Court of Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Justice) who ruled in Mr Taylor's favour in December 1999.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(charity)#cite_note-autogenerated1-11) The ruling meant up to £26 million per annum in benefits being given to men that otherwise would have been denied.[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(charity)#cite_note-18)  **Bus travel concessions**  In 2000 Parity took the Government to the [European Court of Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights) over the fact that it denied [free bus travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_travel_pass) to men aged 60–65.[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(charity)#cite_note-19) Despite Parity's previous successes, the government had refused to end discrimination in this area.[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(charity)#cite_note-autogenerated5-20)  However, in June 2001 it became clear that Parity would win the case if it went to court and the government relented, with [John Prescott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Prescott) announcing men would receive free [bus passes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_pass)   from age 60. Controversially, Prescott hailed the move as ""another   example of the Government providing extra help for pensioners"" whereas   it had effectively been forced into the move by the European Court of   Human Rights.[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(charity)#cite_note-21)   The Travel Concessions (Eligibility) Bill finally passed in 2003   resulting in males receiving the £50 million per annum in benefits that   the state had denied them.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(charity)#cite_note-autogenerated3-13)[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(charity)#cite_note-22)  **Widowers benefits**  Parity   campaigned to end sexism in the payment of widows benefits and   bereavement tax allowances. These were previously only paid to women and   not men. The campaign achieved success in 2001 as a result the  benefits  are now available to both genders.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(charity)#cite_note-autogenerated4-4)[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(charity)#cite_note-23)  **Domestic violence statistics**  In 2008 Parity campaigned to stop the [Crown Prosecution Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Prosecution_Service)   making false statements that the ""overwhelming"" majority of domestic   violence victims were women, whereas in fact about one in three victims   is male. With the aid of the [UK Statistics Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Statistics_Authority) the organisation succeeded and the incorrect claims were removed.[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(charity)#cite_note-24)[\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(charity)#cite_note-25) The organisation also forced [Gillian Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillian_Morgan) of the [Welsh Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Assembly) to stop making the same claims in the ""Strategic Action Plan to Address Violence to Women"".[\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(charity)#cite_note-26)  **MORE GROUPS**  These  are techniques for debating people (look up books on critical thinking  skills - BTW read this as its useful tells you about common techiques  peopel use to discredit you e.g. strawman, ad hominem and how to combat  that) The arguement ""but MRAs dont do anything for men"" is simply  defeated by giving 1 example, as aI did above (well its multiple  examples).  Anyway, there are many more. I will update this and improve this as do some more research (please help me in comments)  **DRAFT**  MRAs  went to a federal court in Texas and won the case that only men being  drafted based only on sex was unconstiutional in the USA  **DOMESTIC VIOLENCE**  Before  2008, the California Health &amp; Safety Code explicitly excluded  male  DV victims from state-funded services such as housing, counseling,  and  legal aid.  I \[not me, the author\] had to sue the state on behalf of four battered men in   the case of Woods v. Horton (2008) 1637 Cal.App.4th 658 to get that   discrimination stricken as  unconstitutional. But the discrimination   continues in various forms, and it will probably take another lawsuit to   get justice again."

You realize nurses go to medical school, right? The issue with regards to ""not enough female doctors"" or whatever is a societal issue, where they're not encouraged (or actively discouraged) from seeking that job path. If it evens out in the next few years, great, the end result will help to normalize itself and we won't need to push for it anymore. The followup of course would be that the vast majority of nursing students are female, and the issue there is the same - it's a societal issue where men are discouraged from the nursing profession. These can both be issues at the same time, and efforts can be made to improve both simultaneously. Which highlights my issue with most MRAs I run into online - they don't tend to give a shit about the men's issue, they're just mad that people care about the woman's issue. ""Not enough male nurses? Well fuck that, women shouldn't be doctors"" seems to be a major sentiment in online discussion, usually in the form of derailing unrelated threads.  While you go on to detail some actual actions MRAs have done, this online presence is where they get a lot of their bad rap from. It would be a lot easier for MRAs to actually build support for their causes if they could somehow reign in the toxic anti-SJW edgelourd wannabes that push people away. And while you're doing a better job of it than most by actually _citing_ things MRAs have done, you're still somewhat failing in that rather than framing your overall post as, ""men's rights matter"" you're still clinging to the narrative of, ""women's rights don't and all feminists are evil"". Don't make it about being the bigger victim, and maybe you could even work _with_ feminists to achieve common goals (of which there are many) a lot faster.  And no, this isn't a ""fake argument"" as you put it - it's the very public outwardly visible face of the movement, and if you're serious about solving the issues, it's a problem. Part of the redpill movie itself is that it spends far too much time just attacking feminism rather than focusing on issues (and again, when it tries to focus on real issues it frequently fails, as the videos I mentioned point out). And even this sub in particular, due to general inactivity, has been more or less taken over by a couple redpiller MRAs who constantly post anti-feminism articles and spend a lot of time attacking feminists rather than actually trying to discuss the issues. My sole advice to MRA's who actually care about men's issues is: stop doing that - it makes you all look bad.  In regards to the work of CESPA/Parity you brought up, as well as the DV case in Texas you say you had a part in (which, if that's the case, good on you - that's awesome), these are the kinds of things they should make a mini-documentary about - highlight the successes of men's rights activism, and don't make it about feminism while doing so. Hopefully Parity can succeed in getting the retirement age synchronized and get all of these kinds of issues at once.  For the draft thing though, that's great, but there's already an ongoing push for something that would end it - support the equal rights amendment, which needs all of _one_ more state to sign off on, and the draft will likely die with it. Iirc there's another fight in courts right now to have it killed, but hey, go at it from multiple fronts, and join the feminists already fighting on both.  ---  Complete aside - for reddit links, if they contain a "" ) "" they'll cut short like a bunch of yours did. You can fix this by ""escaping"" the paren using a backslash ( \ ) right before the offending character (which, to your credit, you did with the brackets in the link texts). The same goes for formatting - like if you type "" \*something\* "" it appears in the final comment as "" *something* "", but you can include the asterisks around the word by typing it like "" \\\*something\\\* "" (and yeah, to type "" \\\* "" you have to escape the backslash as well, so that's actually "" \\\\\* "" - I'll let you do the homework on how I did that one, lol). Worth noting that underscores ( _ ) do the same as asterisks, so some of your links that contain those also need to have them escaped.  So to fix one of your links that displays as:  &gt; ...who ruled in Mr Taylor's favour in December 1999.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(charity)#cite_note-autogenerated1-11) The ruling meant up to £26 million per annum in benefits being given to men that otherwise would have been denied.[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(charity)#cite_note-18)  you need to write it like  &gt; ...who ruled in Mr Taylor's favour in December 1999.\[\\\[11\\\]\](https\://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity\\\_(charity\\\)#cite\\\_note-autogenerated1-11\) The ruling meant up to £26 million per annum in benefits being given to men that otherwise would have been denied.\[\\\[18\\\]\](https\://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity\\\_(charity\\\)#cite\\\_note-18\)  to get this:  &gt; ...who ruled in Mr Taylor's favour in December 1999.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity\_(charity\)#cite\_note-autogenerated1-11) The ruling meant up to £26 million per annum in benefits being given to men that otherwise would have been denied.[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity\_(charity\)#cite\_note-18)"

Transcribing the video for you would be a huge waste of time for me, and probably take longer for you as well. If you want sources, he has plenty in the video description. Again, going through the sources will take a lot longer than just watching the video, and if you're invested in the topic, they'll still be there after, though you'll have a better idea of what to look for.  I'll give you one bit of low-hanging fruit though - TRP complains that like, 99.9% of casualties in war are men, and that's just so gosh darn unfair that we put this great burden solely on the shoulders of men. What they don't mention though is that until like, 2013 women were expressly forbidden from enlisting into combat roles in the US military. Was that because of _feminazis_ unfairly protecting women above men? No, it was the very not-feminist congressmen saying that those little ladies can't do no tough man's work, and the rule was changed because feminists made a stink about it... which MRA's still hate because, well, ""frail little ladies can't do no tough man's work"" - seriously guys, pick your battles; is women in combat roles a bad thing, or is exclusively male combat deaths a bad thing? Choose one and stop getting all ""triggered"" about the other, because these options are mutually exclusive.  There are similar issues with many other stats mentioned, especially with ""dangerous workplace"" numbers.  &gt; they seem to be randos, I don’t know if they’re credible or not  Why is this important when it comes to, say, Knowing Better, but not for Cassie Jay? Why is she defacto-trustworthy, but KB isn't? At the very least, Knowing Better cites everything he references and that can be found in the description. If you take issue with something he says, feel free to look at his own source and find out where he's wrong, or why your complaint is covered.  If you want to call yourself a skeptic, you can't just be skeptical of one side, especially if it's only the side you already decided you don't agree with."
Tasgall,2020-06-15 08:40:28,fuvu1tt,t3_h913xz,t1_fuvl029,"Watching through, here's another fun way to lie with numbers:  &gt; boys in the US are 30-40% more likely to fail or drop out of high school than girls  Technically true - but what does that actually mean? Well, it's 30% more... relative to the number of girls who fail or drop out - not ""the percentage of boys who drop out or fail is 30 higher"" like the phrasing implies - as in, if girls drop out at 5%, boys aren't dropping out at 35%.  The actual dropout rate nationally in 2016 was 7.1% for boys, and 5.1% for girls (both historic lows) - a percentage difference of 2, which isn't particularly alarming, but if we instead say that 7.1 is about 140% of 5.1, oh no, girls get 40% of an advantage over boys, such unfairs :("

A TL;DR or summary would suffice.   &gt;I'll give you one bit of low-hanging fruit though  Thank you, and that is a reasonable point.

I agree with some of your other points about MRA's sometimes seeming to be more angry about feminism than caring about men, there's a flip side to that as well which I thought was the best takeaway from TRP: the reaction to the film and any mens rights / mens issues movement is overwhelmingly hostile and negative. Feminism as a movement seems to feel threatened by men trying to break out of their gender roles unless it's by feminism's rules and regulations, it's gatekeeping and insecurity on a massive level and deosn't reflect well on the movement as a whole IMO."
Tasgall,2020-06-15 09:56:27,fuvyi9u,t3_h913xz,t1_fuvu3si,"&gt; In the nicest way you're saying the film is dishonest then asking me to invest 50 minutes of my time proving a point you want to make because you can't be bothered, it's lazy.  I'm sorry, but you asked for a source, and when provided, are saying ""it's too much effort"". You can't just call *me* lazy for providing a source you don't personally want to put effort into. And the first video is 30 minutes, not 50. Obviously if you want to watch more on the subject, you're free to, but TRP itself is about 2 hours, you can spend a quarter of that on something critical of it, or hell, just watch until he's so wrong and you disagree, I'm sure it'll only be like, 12 seconds tops.  &gt; C'mon, you're the one trying to debunk TRP  Yeah, because I watched both it, _and_ content critical of it that cited and promoted their sources, and because it promotes an inaccurate and frankly dangerous worldview that deserves criticism, but gets paraded around as if it reveals some kind of hidden truth about society. Having looked into it a bit more than people who watch it once and take it all for gospel, I think it's worth pointing out. I'm only critical of TRP because having watched both it and responses to it that look deeper into the subject and even into their own sources, my conclusion is that TRP is, well, what I described it as - dangerous and inaccurate. Having a conclusion after considering both isn't the same as feigning skepticism of criticism having only ever seen the non-critical arguments.  &gt; I agree with some of your other points about MRA's sometimes seeming to be more angry about feminism than caring about men, there's a flip side to that as well which I thought was the best takeaway from TRP: the reaction to the film and any mens rights / mens issues movement is overwhelmingly hostile and negative  That's true - the reaction to MRA's and TRP is largely negative, but that negativity is largely _because_ of the general MRA focus on anti-feminism and TRP's own focus on complaining about feminists/women, as well as the inaccurate portrayal of statistics to further that goal. It _kind_ of sounds like a chicken/egg problem of ""which came first"", except in this case, there's a definitive and objective answer - feminism came first, men's rights groups are explicitly responses to feminism, and they initially came out swinging with complaints of feminism and anti-SJW rhetoric. The unfortunately gendered term ""feminism"" was coined because at the time, women very much _were_ an underclass - when ""Men's Rights Activists"" was coined, men were not at all an underclass, and the gendering of the term was done only as a foil to feminism. If it wasn't, they would have rallied around the term Egalitarian first (instead of brigading it later as an afterthought).  &gt; Feminism as a movement seems to feel threatened by men trying to break out of their gender roles unless it's by feminism's rules and regulations  Do you have any examples of that? If you do, I'd likely agree - if men want to enter fields that are typically woman dominated, they should be able to. In most I'm aware of though, such as teaching, or nursing, feminists tend to agree as well.  ---  I gave another example from the first video in another comment, but to consolidate threads since that's probably just going to be annoying...  &gt; boys in the US are 30-40% more likely to fail or drop out of high school than girls  This is a claim that's technically true, and an example of a common way to lie with numbers. This implies but doesn't mean, for example, that if girls are dropping out at a rate of 5% that boys are therefore dropping out at 35%. It's a relative percentage - as in, boys drop out at a percentage which is 40% higher than the percentage at which girls drop out. So in 2016, the rate for boys was 7.1% and the rate for girls was 5.1% - both historic lows, and a 2% difference isn't particularly alarming, so we can instead note that 7.1 is about 140% of 5.1 - oh noes, a 40% difference, how unfair!  ---  A bonus one, since I ended up just watching the video. 30 minutes is _not_ a very long time, I assure you...  &gt; There is only ONE domestic violence shelter for men in the US!  This is another common talking point, and easy way to lie with numbers. There exists only one domestic violence shelter for _only_ men in the US, but there are hundreds that serve anyone regardless of gender. According to the source she used in the movie, nearly 500,000 men in 2010 made use of domestic violence housing services. I can assure you, those 500k weren't all using that one shelter.  Also worth noting, from the same source the movie uses on domestic violence, it also provides statistics on rape that the movie doesn't use. TRP and MRA's in general like to frame female-on-male rape as if it's roughly an equal issue to male-on-female rape, and while it's definitely a _real_ issue, it's not even close to the same. From that source, 1 in 5 women will be raped in their lifetime, compared to 1 in 71 men. Are these both issues? Absofuckinglutely, but are they equivalent in quantity? No. Not at all. Both should have access to support for it, but just on a 1:1 basis, women need a lot more of it.  Another, because I'm feeling generous (and procrastinating)  &gt; Of all custodial parents, ~80% are women, and only 18% or so are men  Another example of something that's technically true - of kids who are currently under the custody of a single parent after a divorce case, these numbers are accurate.  But why did I have to phrase it weird? Why not just say ""80% of custody cases favor the woman""? Well, in the 80's that would be true as well. But in 1994, it was about 70%, and by 2008, it was 42%. So why is the quoted line _technically_ accurate when the actual number is 42%? Because 80% of children _currently in custody_ were sent with the mother. As in, if you were born in 2002 and your parents were divorced soon after, and your mom got full custody, and your state allowed your mom to claim you as a dependent until you're 20, you would currently still be counted for this statistic because of the strange way it's worded.  So yes, 80% of current custodial parents are mothers, but in 20 years, that number will more closely resemble the result of custody cases being decided today.  Also, for all the complaints of the family court system greatly favoring women (which it does), it's worth mentioning that 91% of divorces where custody is involved don't go through family courts at all, and they're instead just agreed to by the parents outside of court - and in those cases, 51% go to the mother because the father just... lets them. This is actually one of my big issues with MRA's and spreading these kinds of narratives - a while ago, this topic came up in /r/politics, and someone (who self-described as an MRA) responded to me saying they personally went through this, as a father, who lost their child in this system, and complained that it was unfair. Which sucks, sure, but after some very mild prodding he said he skipped his court date because it just wasn't worth it because the courts favor the mother. Like... the fuck, man, no shit she's going to win in court when you _literally don't go_. The idea that it's hopeless and that you shouldn't even try is extremely pervasive, and likely contributes to this imbalance on its own - I doubt that guy was the only one.  He then goes on to play a clip of MRA favorite SJW bogey(wo)man Big-Red giving her classic ranty ""screeching-feminazi"" spiel about ""ThE pAtRiArChY"". Turns out, if you listen to the words instead of I don't know, ignoring everything she says because ""crazy feminist"", she's actually arguing in favor of men on this very thing ([Timestamped in case you still don't want to watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDrJo8d45gc&amp;t=22m09s) - it's like, one minute for that bit, and less than ten for the rest of the video if you're so inclined).  There are a number of other issues with the movie, but I think that's enough for now. The Big Joel video looks into some of the more specific cases iirc, specifically into some of the guys complaining about child custody that were featured, and from what I recall, there was a really, really good reason they lost custody (one of them tried to leave the state with the kid to avoid the court hearing or something... yeah, custody court doesn't like you doing that. Of course that was omitted in TRP). The courts are still unfair, but not nearly as much as they used to be, and if you want to argue that point it helps to vet your examples instead of airing the grievances of essentially an attempted kidnapper, lol.  To echo my conclusion from earlier, I don't hate TRP because it's TRP or ""MRA bad"" or whatever. I dislike TRP because it argues a dangerous and false narrative that often gets used to radicalize men who tend to be emotionally vulnerable. There are real issues facing men's rights, but they should be handled from a lens of egalitarianism, not from the lens of dishonest anti-SJW victimhood-pushing bullshit propaganda. In the long run, its message will only make it more difficult to actually solve the issues that matter."
Tasgall,2020-06-15 10:06:12,fuvz2xx,t3_h913xz,t1_fuutwed,"I take the fact that we get downvoted so hard for daring to look at TRP with a critical eye as a badge of honor, lol.

Douglas0327,2020-06-15 10:20:09,fuvzxlz,t3_h913xz,t1_fuvyi9u,"Hey, thanks for the detailed answer, it's kinda what I was hoping for at the outset.   &gt;feminism came first, men's rights groups are explicitly responses to feminism  Yup. MRA is not a title I particularly like either, with the odd exception men generally have the rights they need, it's the gender role and cultural expectations that are the most problematic as far as I'm concernded.   &gt;Feminism as a movement seems to feel threatened by men trying to break out of their gender roles unless it's by feminism's rules and regulations  r/menslib is a good example and the general insistence that feminism = egalitarianism so there's no need for seperate mens rights / issues / advocacy groups. I'm being anecdotal but there's plenty of examples of this, your timestamped video being a good one. The delightful Big Red does make some relevant points, but mainly because she's gatekeeping feminism and doesn't want to give legs to what she sees as a rival movement.   &gt;I dislike TRP because it argues a dangerous and false narrative  It's definitely one-sided, but that's probably subjective. I tend to think movements have to push the needle a little to get to a centre point.   &gt;often gets used to radicalize men who tend to be emotionally vulnerable  Hhhhmmmm we may have to agree to differ on that. At this point publicity for mens issues is good IMO.  &gt;There are real issues facing men's rights, but they should be handled from a lens of egalitarianism  Absolutely.   Thank you for the conversation.  E: typos"
Tasgall,2020-06-15 12:01:21,fuw6oaa,t3_h913xz,t1_fuvzxlz,"&gt; MRA is not a title I particularly like either, with the odd exception men generally have the rights they need, it's the gender role and cultural expectations that are the most problematic as far as I'm concernded.  Indeed, and most feminists would agree with that. People like to complain and get all huffy about terms like ""Toxic Masculinity"" and ""The Patriarchy"", but if you actually look into it, a lot of men's rights problems are rooted in the same thing. Men are encouraged to take dangerous jobs and discouraged from taking weak sissy girl jobs, men are discouraged from seeking emotional help, men are told to suck it up and not be a bitch. All of this is encapsulated in toxic masculinity. Men are expected to be responsible, men are expected to be the breadwinners. Men aren't stay at home parents, that's for women only, men don't get custody, they're not the child-raisers like women are. That's all examples of patriarchy.  If you look beyond the surface level language and actually discuss the meaning behind them, most MRA issues line up exactly with feminist issues, so the movie going out of its way to frame all of these same issues as the _fault_ of feminism - to blame women for it rather than actually try to find a solution - is counterproductive. If you don't like the terminology, sure, whatever that's fine, but when you hear words like, ""toxic masculinity"" know what they're referring to and don't just brush it off as ""dumb feminazis patriarchy doesn't exist"" or whatever.  &gt; r/menslib is a good example and the general insistence that feminism = egalitarianism so there's no need for seperate mens rights / issues / advocacy groups  I'm not entirely sure what point you're trying to make in this section - I was requesting examples of feminists ""feeling threatened"" by men trying to break out of gender roles, but you seem to be describing like, a clan rivalry or something. The Big Red segment wasn't her trying to gatekeep feminism per se, she's presenting feminist arguments to counter the claim that feminists don't care or are against those points.  Again, the surface-level terminology is kind of an issue - if /r/menslib agree with feminists on everything, but don't want to call themselves feminists, then... who cares? The issues are agreed on, just work to solve them. Being offended by whether ""fem"" or ""men"" is in the title is stupid. This is why I prefer the term egalitarian, even if MRA's are trying to co-opt it, because it's unambiguous. It's not ""fix women's issues so genders are equal"", it's not ""fix men's issues so genders are equal"" - it's ""fix _issues_ so genders are equal"". Bonus, there isn't much room to excuse extremism like there is with ""men's rights"" or ""feminism"". While I'd prefer that though, feminism at least has an excuse for being gendered - it's a holdout from the 60's when women _didn't_ have rights. All of the male-gendered counters though are just that - counters. They're not trying to be equal, they explicitly oppose, and that's counterproductive.  &gt; It's definitely one-sided, but that's probably subjective. I tend to think movements have to push the needle a little to get to a centre point.  There's a big distinction between subjective and misleading, or outright lying, and TRP crosses the line multiple times. For something like this to ""push the needle"" you need to hammer the facts - the biggest facts that strike home in an emotional way and really get people to see the problem. You don't get a pass for lying about them. You don't get a pass for fabricating evidence. You don't get a pass for making it more about opposing ""the other"" than actually presenting solutions, especially when you're doing so by misrepresenting the goals and views of ""the other"" to begin with.  A ""movement kicker"" like this intended to push a movement into the spotlight needs to be honest. And if it *can't* be honest about the issues it cares about, then perhaps it's not an honest movement to begin with.  &gt; Hhhhmmmm we may have to agree to differ on that. At this point publicity for mens issues is good IMO  We may have to disagree indeed. ""No such thing as bad publicity"" is false. When you have real issues men face in the world, presenting false evidence and lying about it in order to build animosity between groups - especially groups that _agree_ on so many issues - you are exacerbating the problem and making it worse. TRP does this in spades, and draws people into /r/theredpill culture, which is _far_ worse than the movie delves into, and due to a very heavy overlap, eventually into alt-right politics. It's a ""gateway"" if you will, dealing with issues that sound reasonable on the surface to moderates, but can easily get people watching similar content that goes step by step further into [the anti-SJW pipeline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69obN625Fjs) until the issues they care about gradually go from ""men are unfairly treated by family court"" to ""the left is against personal responsibility"" to ""SJWs are controlling the media"" to ""white genocide/the great replacement is a problem"" to ""the jewish question"" to ramming a car through a street of protesters because the driver decided they're all antifa.  Not everyone goes that far, but the ones who do tend to start with shit like this. Men's issues need publicity that isn't filled with lies and mistruths, and once it does, it'll be easier to find allies when the claims aren't so easily debunked, and they don't view their should-be allies as defacto enemies.  &gt; Thank you for the conversation  No problem, I hope it was useful, even if I initially questioned your sincerity. I do recommend watching them if you have time though, because they do go into issues and details I didn't mention here. At this point, I do need to stop procrastinating, so happy watching, and have a nice day - stay critical :)  ---  Also, I wanted to mention a couple more issues with TRP that [Joel's second video gets into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0dwWLY3SyY) that KB doesn't - see, a large section of TRP deals with anecdotes about men getting losing child custody cases or something. They kind of act like they're representative of bigger issues, but... aren't.  In one, a guy in the movie tells a story about a case in Texas where, in taking one of his five kids to the hospital, discovers due to a blood mismatch that the kids - all of them - aren't his. His wife had cheated on him with ""a guy down the street"", and like, yeah - that sucks. Is it representative of anything to do with men's rights? ...not... really? It's a huge outlier.  In another, there's a case where a black man in South Carolina gets a woman pregnant, and without his knowledge she puts the child up for adoption in another state. It's trying to frame adoptions as some big privilege of women as part of reproductive control and whatnot, and in this case, the father had no consent, and that is indicative of a systemic problem, or something. Well, looking into the actual case, the act from the woman was technically legal due only to a specific outdated South Carolina law about miscegenation - aka, the kind of law that bans interracial marriage, which said the child could be adopted away to another state. What the movie doesn't show though, because it's against the narrative, is that the guy won the case and got his daughter back. So, not indicative of a systemic problem - actually a remnant of a racial problem - and not an example of the courts being against men... but TRP doesn't care, TRP has a narrative to push.  There was another one in a case from Utah where a woman put a child up for adoption against the father's wishes. Again, the guy took it to court and won the case, but TRP doesn't deem that detail important enough to show either, for some reason."
Douglas0327,2020-06-15 13:12:53,fuwcigf,t3_h913xz,t1_fuw6oaa,"&gt; get all huffy about terms like ""Toxic Masculinity"" and ""The Patriarchy"",  Agreed, these terms are somewhat gendered though and can often used in bad faith. Patricarchy is a good example: you and I know it means a system of Government where positions of socio-economic power tends to be given to men, however it is often used as bait and switch tactic for ""men oppress women"". Feminism and social sciences has a history of redefining terms to suit their own agenda and outlaw wrongthink, the trickle down use of ""racism"" to mean ""systemic racism"" to then mean ""you can't be racist to white people"" would be a clear example.   &gt;most MRA issues line up exactly with feminist issues  Yes, but not everyone acts in good faith and in the same way you believe MRAs should reel in their screechy crowd the same can be said for feminism. We are at the point where it's OK for a feminist, or someone claiming to be, can tweet \#killallmen   &gt;frame all of these same issues as the fault of feminism  I didn't get that sense at all, maybe I'll rewatch. I got the sense of (people claiming to be) feminsts trying to gatekeep and shout down what they saw as a threat.   &gt;I was requesting examples of feminists ""feeling threatened"" by men trying to break out of gender roles  Apologies, I misinterpreted that. OK, women (and men) thinking men who want to work in childcare are suspicious. JK Rowling thinking women need to be protected ""from men"" (which is the basis of her objection to trans women using women's spaces).   &gt;""No such thing as bad publicity"" is false.  We can leave that then.   &gt; I hope it was useful  It was and I will watch the vids.   &gt;even if I initially questioned your sincerity  TBH I did yours so we're even  &gt;It's a huge outlier.  Yep people being shits to each other doesn't mean there's a systemic issue.   Enjoy your day too"

It what world does that make it okay to write articles promoting rape and violence?

Feel free to look at them.  &gt; his arguements are dumb e.g. women being banned from milatry... no they are exempt,  The fuck does that mean? Exempt from the draft, yes, and that's likely going to change. And yes, they *were* banned from *combat roles* in the military until 2013. This is a fact. They had to pass legislation to undo it. A fact that is also why the draft is under review and likely to change.  &gt; Not just with marking, but the studies show in discipline also, including boys getting excluded for non excludbale offences  Not going to bother reading it since you obviously didn't bother to read anything I wrote or watch the videos (otherwise you wouldn't have argued against them with the very points being rebutted), but let's give you the benefit of the doubt you definitely don't deserve.

What a dumb point? MRAs are doing stuff with that? Your point makes no sense and is circular... MRAs dont do anything?.... erm hello did you see above post? They literally changed the life of every single person living in the united kingdom and gave men (and indrectly women) billions in benifts.  What a dumb arguement.

Dunkolunko,2020-06-15 16:52:32,fux1vx1,t3_h9jdhu,t3_h9jdhu,"I'm afraid this isa bit of a deception, and it's not even intentional. Black men are like 96/7% of black deaths, so of ciurse they're talking about men. But they aren't talking about black men, but blacks. There is no discussion of the gendered nature of police shootings, which has actually much more evidence to it's existing than a racial disparity. But it's not even about police deaths. That's just a gateway argument into a broader movement. Meanwhile black communities treat their men as deadbeats while venerating their women and enslaving men in child support, leading to a cycle of debt and jail. BLM is feminist and views men as being above women on the oppression ladder, so they don't care about men except in how they are black.  In fact, very little good has arisen from this whole scenario. A real and complex issue of black disenfranchisement and excessive policing that disproportionately affects black communities that could have practical solutions proposed and peacefully protested on a broad scale has instead fed into a simplistic cultish tribalist fight against the nebulous and endlessly broad notion of ""white supremacy"" with false and misleading central arguments that nust be adhered to dogmatically, dangerously radical slogans that are defended in a motte and bailey fashion, encouraging violence, anarchy, division, etc. and has created a hysterical mob rule where anyone who offers even mild criticism of the most extreme proponents of the movement can be labelled a white supremacist and then it becomes okay to destroy their livelihoods and perhaps even commit violence against them. Censorship has begun, companies dedicating, essentially under duress, to enact discriminatory hiring policies to capitulate to the desires of the mob, saving them for now, until their demands grow more extreme. The movement to abolish all police is real, even if many have a more moderate view (for now). I know this is a rant, and perhaps inarticulately expressed, but this movement is not a good thing. There is no allowance for moderate or rational support, anything but 100% support makes you an enemy, and the extremes that support requires has been increasing continuously. The intent is for dissenting thought and debate to be silenced, punished. That's not even discussing the harm done economically to riot hit areas or the potential covid issue."
mhandanna,2020-06-15 16:59:18,fux2po5,t3_h913xz,t1_fuvzxlz,"&gt;Do you have any examples of that? If you do, I'd likely agree - if men want to enter fields that are typically woman dominated, they should be able to. In most I'm aware of though, such as teaching, or nursing, feminists tend to agree as well.  How utterly sheltered are you in your echo chamber?  There was a proposal at Simon  Fraser University (near Vancouver) to open up a men's centre on campus  to address issues like suicide, drug/alcohol addiction, and negative  stereotypes. The women's centre, which already existed, opposed this.  They argued that a men's centre is not needed because the men's centre  is already ""everywhere else"" (even though those issues aren't being  addressed ""everywhere else""). The alternative they proposed was a ""male  allies project"" to ""bring self-identified men together to talk about  masculinity and its harmful effects"" \[1\].  A student at Durham University in England, affected by the suicide of  a close male friend, tried to open up the Durham University Male Human Rights Society: ""\[i\]t’s incredible how much stigma there is against male weakness. Men’s issues are deemed unimportant, so I decided to start a  society"". The idea was rejected by the Societies Committee as it was  deemed ""controversial"". He was told he could only have a men's group as a branch of the Feminist Society group on campus. This was ironic since he point them to the feminist societies own literature which states  it would be extremely unreasonable for them to discuss issues about men\[9\].  Author Warren Farrell went to give a talk on the boys' crisis (boys  dropping out of school and committing suicide at higher rates) at the  University of Toronto, but he was opposed by protesters who ""barricaded  the doors, harassed attendees, pulled fire alarms, chanted curses at  speakers and more"". Opposition included leaders in the student union \[2\]  \[3\].  Three students (one man and two women) at Ryerson University (also in  Toronto) decided to start a club dedicated to men's issues. They were  blocked by the Ryerson Students' Union, which associated the men's  issues club with supposed ""anti-women's rights groups"" and called the  idea that it's even possible to be sexist against men an ""oppressive  concept"" \[4\]. The student union also passed a motion saying that it  rejects ""Groups, meetings events or initiatives \[that\] negate the need  to centre women’s voices in the struggle for gender equity"" (while  ironically saying that women's issues ""have historically and continue to  today to be silenced"") \[5\].  Janice Fiamengo, a professor at the University of Ottawa, was giving a  public lecture on men's issues. She was interrupted by a group of  students shouting, blasting horns, and pulling the fire alarm \[6\].  At Oberlin College in Ohio, various students had invited equity  feminist Christina Hoff Sommers (known for her individualist/libertarian  perspective on gender) to give a talk on men's issues. Activists hung  up posters identifying those who invited her (by their full names) as  ""supporters of rape culture"" \[7\] \[8\].  At Saint Paul University (part of the University of Ottawa) on  September 24th, 2015, journalist Cathy Young gave a talk on gender  politics on university campuses, GamerGate, the tendency to neglect  men's issues in society, and the focus on the victimization of women (in  the areas of sexual violence and cyberbullying). She was met by masked  protesters who called her ""rape apologist scum"" and interrupted the  event by pulling the fire alarm \[10\].  In 2015, the University of York in the U.K. announced its intention  to observe International Men's Day, noting that they are ""also aware of  some of the specific issues faced by men"", including  under-representation of (and bias against) men in various areas of the  university (such as academic staff appointments, professional support  services, and support staff in academic departments) \[11\]. This inspired  a torrent of criticism, including an open letter to the university  claiming that a day to celebrate men's issues ""does not combat inequality, but merely amplifies existing, structurally imposed,  inequalities"". The university responded by going back on its plans to  observe International Men's Day and affirming that ""the main focus of  gender equality work should continue to be on the inequalities faced by  women"". In contrast, the University of York's observation of  International Women's Day a few months earlier was a week long affair  with more than 100 events \[12\].

Where do you get your 70% figure from for Europe in general?  &gt; yet they keep banging on about the most random obscure stat about women.... e.g. like 90% of primary school teachers being female but the problem is not enouh female head teachers LMAO feminsim 101  Who? Where are these renowned feminists ""going on"" about it?  You know why I prefer sources like the videos I linked and primary references over right wing/MRA content or posts? Because when someone like Joel is talking about an issue, he says, ""here's what the MRA's say"" and plays a clip of a notable MRA saying a thing, then responds to that specific thing. Meanwhile, in anti-SJW land, you're not giving any sources, you're not presenting real arguments, you're just saying random shit. You're just saying, ""FEMINISTS BELIEVE THIS ABSURD THING AND THEY ALL HATE MEN THAT'S OBVIOUS LOL"" and that's supposed to be convincing? Didn't you link _me_ an article earlier about strawman arguments? You realize this is a strawman, right? You're just framing ""feminists LEADERS"" as whatever your bogeyman fever dream of spooky SJW feminists currently is and deciding, ""yep, that's what they believe, that's what feminism is, look how crazy they are!"" as if that's a real argument.  &gt; MRA online? WTF are you on about? Its the face of MRA? No its not.  Yes, MRA's online. WTF am I talking about? You. You are what I'm talking about.

And no, nowhere did I say I was ""free from criticism"", what are you talking about?  &gt; feminism is ripe for criticism  Yes? Feminists criticize feminism all the time, that's what makes it a real ideology - the ideas get tested among members, and change over time based on new arguments. Unlike MRAs, who, as evidenced by this thread, don't particularly take kindly to any of their nonsense being challenged. If you can't challenge your own ideology, it's not a real ideology, it's a cult.  &gt; go on black pill feminism, gender critical, etc racists, transphobic, deluded, man hating lesbians even human hating.... so it that the face of feminism?  ""Go specifically to the place where the worst examples of self-described feminists and man-haters are to deliberately look for the worst possible example of the fringiest fringe in the movement, that's a _real_ feminist!""  You realize feminists have a derogatory term for those kinds of people, right? TERFs. If _feminists_ have a word to slander other feminists, maybe there are different subsects at this point, and maybe TERFs aren't exactly representative of all feminists? And ""man hating lesbians""? lol.  You know the difference between feminists and MRAs? I don't have to go explicitly looking for the shitty MRA's in their shitty MRA subs or on Voat. The MRAs who venture out into other areas of the internet are always shitty enough.  &gt; Actually I dont even need to do that? Actual feminsit LEADERS, authors etc are actual man haters and human haters... I dont need to go on line... THE ACTUAL LEADERS of feminsm  ""I don't need to even look for examples because my MIND PALACE houses my imaginary frenemy feminist I made up who is the definitive ideal of ALL feminists because I said so, and any feminist who says otherwise is wrong about what they believe because _I_ decide what they believe!""

mhandanna,2020-06-15 17:17:08,fux4xmw,t3_h913xz,t1_fuw6oaa,"The hilarity of your statement is actually masculinity is the soloution to most of those poblems... e.g. to get men to solve health problems is frame the issues as problems to be solved, or enourage personal resonsbilibty and looking after your family.  Also men opening up is bull. Feminism has taken an interest in this as it allows them to peddle fake toxic masc idea...Women commit more suicide, 2x more likely to be depressed, anxious, neutrotic etc, eating disorders, all events seem to affect them worse mentall e.g. COVID is affecting them more even though men are dying more, they feear crime more than men despite less crimes... so opening up   If women had the same issues as men, they would kill themselves just a much... e.g. if 80% of homeless was women or women lost house and family in divorce as much they would most certainly be comitting suicide in huge numbers etc etc.  Men need to open up more is a weak feminist arguement for lets not solve issues e.g. more spending on mens health lets just all be feminsits instead and solve patriarchy (a stupid nebolous concept)... on the other hand for womens issues yeah patraichy etc, but we need $8 billion funding as well... men no dont need that its toxic masculnity  Also another great example of why feminsit theory is stupid is it is not practical... its not toxic masculinuty that men dont visit dr as much its practical reasons e.g. women take contaception whee they see drs and nurses, get weighed, get asked mental health questions, have periods, have UTIs frequently so see drs incidentally, they get prengnat and have full body checks... parctical way of solving this is mens health check ups.... instead you blame patraichy LMAO!! Or people have done it... they have advertised mens health in areas where men congreagte e.g. gyms and sports events... and guess what? it works... feminists on the other hand come up with nebollous bullshit theories such as toxic masculinity hahaha  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Do you have any examples of that?

A student at Durham University in England, affected by the suicide of  a close male friend, tried to open up the Durham University Male Human Rights Society: ""\[i\]t’s incredible how much stigma there is against male weakness. Men’s issues are deemed unimportant, so I decided to start a  society"". The idea was rejected by the Societies Committee as it was  deemed ""controversial"". He was told he could only have a men's group as a branch of the Feminist Society group on campus. This was ironic since he point them to the feminist societies own literature which states  it would be extremely unreasonable for them to discuss issues about men\[9\].  Author Warren Farrell went to give a talk on the boys' crisis (boys  dropping out of school and committing suicide at higher rates) at the  University of Toronto, but he was opposed by protesters who ""barricaded  the doors, harassed attendees, pulled fire alarms, chanted curses at  speakers and more"". Opposition included leaders in the student union \[2\]  \[3\].  Three students (one man and two women) at Ryerson University (also in  Toronto) decided to start a club dedicated to men's issues. They were  blocked by the Ryerson Students' Union, which associated the men's  issues club with supposed ""anti-women's rights groups"" and called the  idea that it's even possible to be sexist against men an ""oppressive  concept"" \[4\]. The student union also passed a motion saying that it  rejects ""Groups, meetings events or initiatives \[that\] negate the need  to centre women’s voices in the struggle for gender equity"" (while  ironically saying that women's issues ""have historically and continue to  today to be silenced"") \[5\].  Janice Fiamengo, a professor at the University of Ottawa, was giving a  public lecture on men's issues. She was interrupted by a group of  students shouting, blasting horns, and pulling the fire alarm \[6\].  At Oberlin College in Ohio, various students had invited equity  feminist Christina Hoff Sommers (known for her individualist/libertarian  perspective on gender) to give a talk on men's issues. Activists hung  up posters identifying those who invited her (by their full names) as  ""supporters of rape culture"" \[7\] \[8\].  At Saint Paul University (part of the University of Ottawa) on  September 24th, 2015, journalist Cathy Young gave a talk on gender  politics on university campuses, GamerGate, the tendency to neglect  men's issues in society, and the focus on the victimization of women (in  the areas of sexual violence and cyberbullying). She was met by masked  protesters who called her ""rape apologist scum"" and interrupted the  event by pulling the fire alarm \[10\].  In 2015, the University of York in the U.K. announced its intention  to observe International Men's Day, noting that they are ""also aware of  some of the specific issues faced by men"", including  under-representation of (and bias against) men in various areas of the  university (such as academic staff appointments, professional support  services, and support staff in academic departments) \[11\]. This inspired  a torrent of criticism, including an open letter to the university  claiming that a day to celebrate men's issues ""does not combat inequality, but merely amplifies existing, structurally imposed,  inequalities"". The university responded by going back on its plans to  observe International Men's Day and affirming that ""the main focus of  gender equality work should continue to be on the inequalities faced by  women"". In contrast, the University of York's observation of  International Women's Day a few months earlier was a week long affair  with more than 100 events \[12\].

Feminism has taken an interest in this as it allows them to peddle fake toxic masc idea...Women commit more suicide, 2x more likely to be depressed, anxious, neutrotic etc, eating disorders, all events seem to affect them worse mentall e.g. COVID is affecting them more even though men are dying more, they feear crime more than men despite less crimes... so opening up   &gt;   &gt;If women had the same issues as men, they would kill themselves just a much... e.g. if 80% of homeless was women or women lost house and family in divorce as much they would most certainly be comitting suicide in huge numbers etc etc.   &gt;   &gt;Men need to open up more is a weak feminist arguement for lets not solve issues e.g. more spending on mens health lets just all be feminsits instead and solve patriarchy (a stupid nebolous concept)... on the other hand for womens issues yeah patraichy etc, but we need $8 billion funding as well... men no dont need that its toxic masculnity   &gt;   &gt;Also another great example of why feminsit theory is stupid is it is not practical... its not toxic masculinuty that men dont visit dr as much its practical reasons e.g. women take contaception whee they see drs and nurses, get weighed, get asked mental health questions, have periods, have UTIs frequently so see drs incidentally, they get prengnat and have full body checks... parctical way of solving this is mens health check ups.... instead you blame patraichy LMAO!! Or people have done it... they have advertised mens health in areas where men congreagte e.g. gyms and sports events... and guess what? it works... feminists on the other hand come up with nebollous bullshit theories such as toxic masculinity hahaha"

I haven’t heard a panel take up this fact but that sentiment does exist. I wouldn’t have posted if I hadn’t heard it often enough to mention it here.  As for “defunding the police,” I’m kinda a snob when it comes to language. When my 13 year-old daughter heard it, she immediately thought it meant; welp, you’re all on your own; because that’s exactly what it sounds like. It’s a problem for anyone whose been the victim of crime. Of course we have to police ourselves.  On the other hand, the way we’ve chosen to do so is clearly discriminatory against black people (it seems fairly obvious this is often on purpose). Honestly, and I don’t know what alternative would exist, but the whole idea of putting humans in cages seems inhumane but there are people screwed up enough that they must be separated from society. I imagine there’s probably a CRISPR solution or something medical down the line at some point; maybe that’d be worse? I really don’t know. I certainly don’t want to be in a fucking cage! We’re already trapped on only one planet!  As for the companies, they’re only interested in one color: green. To my way of thinking, we need to impose stronger regulations on them and demand they take more of the burden off of working people for taxes; but that seems unlikely since they control politicians on both sides of the aisle; and, yes, there exists corruption in unions, too. I don’t know what it will take to get people to see that giving $5 trillion dollars to multinationals is far less effective than the $1200 the government gave individuals to stay home, in fighting CoVid-19, while keeping the economy going. Heck, we can’t even know where most of the corporate welfare went!   We’re in a fairly precarious place. I mentioned it above; but I’ll take whatever positive signs I can!"

There are *some* people who are screwed up enough that they must be separated from society. However what is done in the USA is that people who are not screwed up enough are placed in prisons, where *they get screwed over* so much that they get screwed up. There seems to be a *serious* lack of empathy in the USA, where someone who commits a crime is no longer seen as human - see for example all the prison rape jokes.   But before that people also get screwed over getting them in jail. The quality of your education program is coupled to where you live, so poor people receive poor schooling, there is a focus on punishment and revenge instead of rehabilitation, there are so many factors...  But the endnote is, yes some people will have to be incarcerated, but the USA does not incarcerate people to protect society. Quite frankly, I have no idea why the hell it incarcerates so many people. (Historic) racism seems a factor though."

Dunkolunko,2020-06-16 00:25:03,fuylumx,t3_h9jdhu,t1_fux81ma,"I agree that the police system needs major reform and at least most aspects of proactive policing should go. I also can see how it often involves some level of black discrimination. Not in shootings, the data isn't there, but in minor excessive force, and more significantly searches, frisking, policing those communities and minor arrests. However I don't think it is ""obvious"", nor wise to assume, that it is often on purpose. Obviously there are people who still believe in white supremacy but I think it is a mistake to explain with malice what could otherwise be explained with stupidity, or in this case, unconscious bias. Most studies do not show white people to have significant inherent bias against black people, but it seems police may have more. I suggest there are a few factors. 1. Simple profiling. I don't endorse it but the reason it is used is that in theory it increases your hit rate. Eg. If you can identify some aspect which statistically correlates with crime targeting people with that descriptor can make your success rate higher. Obviously in effect this is discrimination and terribly oversimplistic when race based, and among other issues is a self exacerbating cycle when those arrests add to the stats, and by now are totally out of whack. 2. Subconscious bias that builds up particularly through consistent antagonism. Police police black areas because more crime. They wuickly learn most blacks HATE them for this, both for reasons real and for lies fed to them. Cops deal with constant hatred and abuse for policing in a way which honestly is long term destructive but they either think is important or just a part of their job that they had no choice in. Groups like BLM exaggerate and fan the flames, and back and forth, back and forth, despite many of their (both police and black community's) originally good intentions, resentment builds, fear builds, and unconscious bias starts to affect the way they do their policing. When they go up to a black person who they intend to arrest or investigate, theu are coming in with that ingrained sense that they are already in conflict because that person belongs to a group that are perpetually hateful of and a t odds with their group.  The reason I write this is because I see phrases like ACAB as highly destructive and creating worse, not better, tensions between police and blacks. It completely others and villifies ALL police officers, who in most cases probably joined hoping they could make a positive difference and keep people safe, even if a lot of their job ends up not doing that very well. I think many of them probably see the faults and the cracks in the system and would want reform at the higher level that could make their job more consistently constructive and stop corruption, but when the only way that they can satisfy the protesters is to quit their jobs and give up their livelihood and ambitions to make a positive change through their job, and support the abolishment of their whole institution they believe in, or else be seen as pure evil scum, how can they support that? How can they get on board with that madness? How can they not feel tortured and helpless in the face of utter villification and alienation from the people they always wanted to protect? Police have problems but they are human too.  That's why I think reform needs to happen, but not this way. This way is chaos, anger, hatred. I think ACAB needs to go, and defundthepolice needs to be replaced with reformthepolice. Instead of it being usvsthem, it needs to be a sincere attempt to get police to unite with the black (and other) communities against not all individual officers but the flawed systems, laws and procedures they are currently expected to operate under.  Acknowledging that police and black people are not enemies, but people trapped in a broken system that needs repair for the sake of all society. Create unity between these groups, and I guarantee the racial disparitues where they exist will start to shrink, and if a movement of thi s nature is su ccessful, it will do far more to create an equal and positive society with much more beneficial policing practices, rather than what we have now, which is hateful large scale bullying tactics creating censorship, discrimunation, fear and resentment."

The passing of that law cut male victims out of support services and legal assistance in more than 60 passages, just because they were male.   &gt;   &gt;You're not the Florida chapter of the NOW, who successfully lobbied to have Governor Rick Scott veto not one, but two alimony reform bills in the last ten years, bills that had passed both houses with overwhelming bipartisan support, and were supported by more than 70% of the electorate.   &gt;   &gt;You're not the feminist group in Maryland who convinced every female member of the House on both sides of the aisle to walk off the floor when a shared parenting bill came up for a vote, meaning the quorum could not be met and the bill died then and there.   &gt;   &gt;You're not the feminists in Canada agitating to remove sexual assault from the normal criminal courts, into quasi-criminal courts of equity where the burden of proof would be lowered, the defendant could be compelled to testify, discovery would go both ways, and defendants would not be entitled to a public defender.   &gt;   &gt;You're not Professor Elizabeth Sheehy, who wrote a book advocating that women not only have the right to murder their husbands without fear of prosecution if they make a claim of abuse, but that they have the moral responsibility to murder their husbands.   &gt;   &gt;You're not the feminist legal scholars and advocates who successfully changed rape laws such that a woman's history of making multiple false allegations of rape can be excluded from evidence at trial because it's ""part of her sexual history.""   &gt;   &gt;You're not the feminists who splattered the media with the false claim that putting your penis in a passed-out woman's mouth is ""not a crime"" in Oklahoma, because the prosecutor was incompetent and charged the defendant under an inappropriate statute (forcible sodomy) and the higher court refused to expand the definition of that statute beyond its intended scope when there was already a perfectly good one (sexual battery) already there.

The women's centre, which already   existed, opposed this. They argued that a men's centre is not needed   because the men's centre is already ""everywhere else"" (even though those   issues aren't being addressed ""everywhere else""). The alternative they   proposed was a ""male allies project"" to ""bring self-identified men   together to talk about masculinity and its harmful effects"" \[1\].  A   student at Durham University in England, affected by the suicide of a   close male friend, tried to open up the Durham University Male Human   Rights Society: ""\[i\]t’s incredible how much stigma there is against male   weakness.

This was ironic since   he point them to the feminist societies own literature which states it   would be extremely unreasonable for them to discuss issues about  men\[9\].  Author  Warren Farrell  went to give a talk on the boys' crisis (boys dropping  out of school  and committing suicide at higher rates) at the University  of Toronto,  but he was opposed by protesters who ""barricaded the doors,  harassed  attendees, pulled fire alarms, chanted curses at speakers and  more"".  Opposition included leaders in the student union \[2\] \[3\].   Three   students (one man and two women) at Ryerson University (also in   Toronto) decided to start a club dedicated to men's issues. They were   blocked by the Ryerson Students' Union, which associated the men's   issues club with supposed ""anti-women's rights groups"" and called the   idea that it's even possible to be sexist against men an ""oppressive   concept"" \[4\]. The student union also passed a motion saying that it   rejects ""Groups, meetings events or initiatives \[that\] negate the need   to centre women’s voices in the struggle for gender equity"" (while   ironically saying that women's issues ""have historically and continue to   today to be silenced"") \[5\].

In 2015, the   University of York in the U.K. announced its intention to observe   International Men's Day, noting that they are ""also aware of some of the   specific issues faced by men"", including under-representation of (and   bias against) men in various areas of the university (such as academic   staff appointments, professional support services, and support staff in   academic departments) \[11\]. This inspired a torrent of criticism,   including an open letter to the university claiming that a day to   celebrate men's issues ""does not combat inequality, but merely amplifies   existing, structurally imposed, inequalities"". The university  responded  by going back on its plans to observe International Men's Day  and  affirming that ""the main focus of gender equality work should  continue  to be on the inequalities faced by women"". In contrast, the  University  of York's observation of International Women's Day a few  months earlier  was a week long affair with more than 100 events"

That is something people who claim to not be racist like BLM fail to recognize. When I bring up the Barbary Slave trade to them that lasted between the 16th and 18th century they have no clue that whites were taken as the most prized slaves from the coasts of western Europe. I just want to live in a world where we can either have open honest discussions about race or one where we can just ignore it and stop opening old wounds.

I don’t think it’s possible to ignore; especially as we continue to make things worse; privatized prisons are one example.   The US was late to the abolitionist party and there are remnants aplenty. The base names and statues seem to me open wounds, with a pretty straightforward solution. We could also be taught about Juneteenth and countless other atrocities that are usually ignored; I didn’t learn about it until just a few years ago! It certainly wasn’t taught in my high school or college. We could make voting easier…there are things we can do, is my point. Let’s get to that and then we can talk about man’s inhumanity to man being a human trait.  P.S. I’m not sure sub-species would be the right characterization. We’re more alike than we’re different and it looks like epigenetics and environment play more of a role in our differences than anything else.

Just like 'metoo' was for male victims as well? :D BLM gives zero fucks about the gendered nature of police violence and how male is the primary factor. All so they can spin the racial narrative. The majority victims of police brutality are white men, yet the discussion is centered around race. Such dishonesty it is shouting to high heavens.  What about feminist ministries? Are you serious? They are literally called 'ministries of equality', yet ignore ANY issue that men face. Even genital mutilation or dying on the job, in a war or from corona, all of which men die much more often from than women...

I am concerned about BLM promoting racist treatment, just as some have done. Calling the criticism of literal discrimination and sexism, as well as dehumanization of men as a sex 'moaning' is dishonest, if not malicious. It clearly shows how much value you assign to these issues.  This started with me calling out your perception of what is essentially 'trickle-down equality'. It stems from the notion that, similar to women's issues being addressed first, racism against black people should be addressed first and foremost, despite being the secondary contributing factor to police violence.  You have done nothing but move the goalpost by asking me what I, a single person, expressing my opinion on the internet have done, instead of focusing on the point I was making - that these organizations only claim to be for equal treatment, while their activities show the exact opposite.  I flipped it back at you, because it is obvious that that is the level of discussion you prefer. It seems apparent that you do not like to be talked to the way you talk to people yourself.

And if we look at the track record of feminism, it hasn't been great at promoting women's responsibilities, and most certainly equal responsibilities. Amongst the earliest example, we can think of the vote in exchange for the draft for men, and in exchange of nothing for women. And child support. Men used to have full rights and responsibility over their children in the rare cases of divorce. Women demanded the rights over their children, but left the responsibility of providing for the kind to the men."

The ethical committee said it's ethical to circumcise, and unethical to forbid it for people under 18.  This, of course, would never be necessary if feminists and governments banned all genital mutilation, not just that of women, including procedures that don't even remove any tissue.

I updated you. Where's your comment, sweetie? Nowhere, as i can see... Oh yeah, your opinion means so much for me, thanks, baby!"

azazelcrowley,2020-06-18 22:12:50,fv9zsqm,t3_hbdat7,t1_fv92bc1,"Attacking feminism is exactly the campaigning you're demanding be done.  If your end goal is building a sand castle and some cunt keeps kicking it down, then you have to beat the shit into him until he stops before you can get to work.  Whining we should be focused on building the sand castle rather than trying to fight the prick kicking them over is missing the point.  A major part of campaigning is making peoples lives *worse if they don't give you what you want.*.  You can argue for black rights all day and night, but the thing that really gets it done is making it clear to white people that if they don't accept it and keep opposing it, their lives will get worse, because black people *will make them worse*.  That's basically how every civil rights movement has gone. You're right they won't support men out of the goodness of their heart, they'll do it because it'll cost them too much if they refuse to."

What the actual fuck? It is also pushing women to work in 80 hour week jobs... which if you want to do fine of course, but that should be your choice (which of course most women would not want to do and is very sensible, why would you work 80 hours when your husband could do it and you get all the money anyway)... but the funny thing is yes there are some amazing jobs out there that you probably would sacrifice much of everyting else for (i.e. you personal life, friends, famliy) but for 90% of people your job is shit and pretty meaningless (work is good for people though, feeling useful, continute to economny, sense of purpose and also friends etc but what I mean it is uliamately pretty shit job so taking 3 years off too raise children is a far better and more fulfilling thing to do then to go back to your shite job and up the corporate ladder)  of course feminsim exists on victimhood and it needs women to be victims and so it needs feminism and the governement.  Feminism has made women miserbale... give it 30 years, the level of female unhappiness is going to be at crisis point... of course something feminsim would love."

I literally said, ""If feminists have a word to slander other feminists..."" - as in, there are multiple groups which call themselves feminist.  Again, engage with the points of your opponent, not your manic fever dream hallucination of what you believe them to be.  &gt; so how is a ""bad MRA"" representive of MRA?  It has to do with proportion. Not all MRA's are shitweasels like you, but they're very few and far between. The origin of ""men's rights movements"" as foils to feminism in the 60's doesn't help either - if they actually cared about equality or equity and disagreed with the gendering of the ""feminism"" label, they'd have just called themselves egalitarian instead of creating their own gendered term and complain about feminists all the time.  &gt; You're the true feminist. Some random person on the internet  Yes, I, who don't claim to be a feminist, is ""the true feminist"", and you, the anti-feminist, are the one with the bigly brain who knows all of the feminism more than feminists do, especially when feminists say you don't, they of course secretly do. Got it.  ---  edit: and lol, why do you keep posting multiple responses to every single post, while not actually addressing anything - do you just have a file of random shit you copy and paste from whenever someone dares to question the alpha-manliness of the MRAs?

It is identifable.  And your comment makes no sense, how do I represent MRA? You dont even represent feminsim. You judge the movement on the political leaders, its idealogly etc. and in the case of feminism that is well known and easily identifilable e.g. intersectioanl, radfem, TERF, ecofeminism, leftists feminism, etc etc  LOL trying to deny TERFs? Its ok cos you slander them? Well they slander the hell out of liberal feminsit as do Rad fems, many dont even consider you feminists. and mock you as pick me's.  LOL proportion.... since we are going to make stuff up 10929% of feminsts pick have hairy butt holes and stick lollipops in them and sing man hating songs.  Once again the very foundation of feminism and more recently people like Dworkin, Solans, Mackinion who have shaped modern feminism and are highly influtential come from women who were raped, abused, had PTSD, schizophrenia, were very ugly, I say that meaning they have severe self esteem and body issues... and these people then understandbly went onto write the biggest load of hateful trash out there and of course these books are now read by young impresisonable girls in campuses who fall for this rubbish.  and yes feminsim is a victimhood mental disroder movement at the moment, not surprising considering so many of the people who shaped the modern wave were literally mentally ill or rape victims:  https://youtu.be/_ohyaZrEucM"

Feminism is a term that came from the 60's, it's gendered because at the time ""fighting for equality"" literally only meant fighting for women's rights - the right to vote, the right to own property, to work, like, basic shit.  ""Men's Rights Activism"" and other similar terms came _after_ and as a direct response, and in opposition to, feminism. When they were created in the 60's and 70's, they were explicitly anti-feminism, not pro-equality.  Today, the term feminism has just stuck around for the movement because everyone knows what it is, and it's hard to change a label with momentum. If you want to create an equality movement ___TODAY___ you shouldn't use a gendered term, because ___TODAY___ neither men nor women are an explicit under-class with literally no rights.  Also, that quick (and frankly, fucking stupid) response so quickly after a response to someone else's post on a 3 day old comment makes for a pretty convincing argument that you're just mhandanna's alt account, lol."

Also speaking of cognitive dissonance, weird that you'd recommend me to ""reconsider my pro-feminist stance"" considering you're literally responding to a thread where I explicitly said I don't claim to be a feminist - I prefer the term egalitarian for a reason, and that's why I've been on this sub, and have been well before it was overrun by dipshit anti-SJW fuckwits.  Also, link spamming doesn't make you automatically look smart. ""Mothers push gender stereotypes"" is not a statement about feminism, it's a claim of statistics. ""One shelter sees more male abuse survivors"" is also not a statement about feminism, it's another claim of statistics. ""A woman did a thing"" is not equivalent to ""FEMINISM AS A BLOC IS ENTIRELY IN SUPPORT OF A THING"". Shitty people exist, women are not exempt from that, but this kind of logic is just as stupid as the MRA strawman-feminism arguments against men, so why on earth would you make them unironically? The fact that female-on-male rape *exists at all* doesn't mean feminists automatically endorse it any more than male-on-female rape means all advocates of men's rights endorse that, for example.

The female minister said that she will never illegalize male genital mutilation.   That was the result of activism done for men. I explained this reality in the comments multiple times, which, btw, wouldn't even be necessary, if you were involved, or interested, in the cause in the first place.   Yet, you ignored it completely, repeated numerous times how you'll like to hear more updates about what my activism is - as if you were any authority on the matter.

I explained the issues and my points to you numerous times, only for you to double down on your efforts to discredit me, even after I suggested you read the whole thread again, after you took a break of your own volition.  So, yeah, I have done everything I could, yet you still refuse to acknowledge that things aren't as simple - and that your logic of not expecting people to care about others outside of their demographic group cannot stand on its own - not to mention it would be torn to shreds by feminists, if you dared to say that men should not be expected to care about women, or their issues. If you were honest to yourself, you'd either acknowledge that you either don't really think that - and that people should care about other people, even those who don't share their genitals or skin color; or that your treatment of people and issues is sexist - and you're not as good of a person as you think you are.

I think you would find that the percentage of men who have managerial positions in nursing exceeds the percentage of men in nursing.  That doesn’t mean women are discriminated against in nursing just on the face of it.   I’m not saying having all women would be better than all men.  I’m saying neither is or can be a meritocracy.

That doesn't necessarily mean it's against men or anyone who isn't a woman.  This only shows your naivety when it comes to this topic.  Feminism is an issue because its foundation is built upon theories and lies which ultimately comes from blaming men. Feminists do not use logic, reason or facts; they concoct a clever idea and then reroute it to blame men. This is the complete opposite of any field of study where they use science and data to publish results. Feminists use terms like male gaze, wage gap or rape culture when those terms are false or absolutely not proven. Feminism is a complete disregard of evidence-based thinking; anyone who supports intellectualism cannot comfortably be a feminist.  Feminism is not the female counterpart of Men's Rights. Men's Rights focuses on male issues, but does so from a perspective of facts and logic. They use reports and studies to determine the issues men face. Feminism doesn't do this. Feminism makes Mickey-Mouse terms like mansplaining or manspreading to spread hate against men under the guise of equality. Then people like yourself try and play it off by saying ""it's not every feminist"". Again, the issue is that the core of feminism is built upon lies and theories. It is definitely not a movement based on science and data.  The female equivalent of men's rights would be women's rights. They would be about focusing on women's issues but they would do so by using studies and research, not make-believe bullcrap.  The logical flaw that many people like yourself make is that because of the constant criticism of feminism here, that somehow that means this subreddit isn't for equality. The concept that you fail to consider is that it's a common topic because feminism is standing in the way of equality.  As a final word, many women here have said that when they criticize any tenets of feminism, feminists have accused them of having ""internal misogyny"". How about that, a movement that sells freedom and choices for women only promotes that as long as they follow their rules. Any dissenting thoughts label these women as having ""internal misogyny"" as if they are defective. It's almost as if feminism has a problem with women thinking for themselves, which includes criticisms against itself.  It's a trash movement and it's eradication would be a big win for freethinkers and scientists."

mhandanna,2020-06-26 14:24:19,fw2clvw,t3_hfxrjz,t1_fw1w2u2,Most of early feminism was very racist and also classist... I mean the whol suffragette thing was basically classist thing
mhandanna,2020-06-26 14:31:39,fw2dfe2,t3_hfxrjz,t1_fw1ufwp,"The average person is not a feminist... not even close in UK 7% of people identify as feminists. Youre also confusing feminism with women. Women are not feminists. And feminism draws huge ""muscle"" and support from men primairily marxists.... in fact large parts of feminism are pretty much invented by men and even core things like patriarchy theory are male concepts feminsits used. Also feminism is pro feminism it isnt even pro woman in the grand scheme of things and also lead the charge in misogny against women it doesnt like.  Secondly, no this is feminism. The random feminsit on the street isn't. The leaders, their organisation, their media, their actions... some random feminsits on the street is completely meaningless... also their feminism is coffee shop feminism, I.e. it is a mish mash of random things they beleive to be feminism... it is usually quite reasonable for the moderate crowd however that isn't feminism. Thats like me desribing nazism or capitalism or socilasm to you...  Feminism at its core is a flawed and hateful movement. I was a feminsts for four years, I know it inside out, its history, its main teachings, the different branches.  One of its major flaws and reasons it is so hateful, is because many of its prominent writers. who helped shape the movement today and are being read today in gender studies e.g. Dworkin, Mackinona, Solans were all mentall ill, PTSD, Schizophrenia, raped, abused, beaten, very ugly so had severe self esteem issues, self hatred, drug problems.... of course this influenced their works and major books and of course this is the basis of modern feminism and its movements"
mhandanna,2020-06-26 14:38:20,fw2e6oi,t3_hfxrjz,t1_fw2cavg,"They are not social media feminists, they are the feminist in power. One example the LATRGEST AND MOST POWERFUL feminsits organisation in the USA blocked all bills to allow shared parenting that were about to pass, and killed any attempts to end lifetime alimony.... no this is feminsits organisations, feminsits politicians, feminists in power... what are you on about feminsim on the street or social media feminsim. LOL. Feminism is a hateful and flawed idealogy. What you are thinking about is womens rights, that isnt feminism.  Or for example, feminsts in government, killin affirmative action in Sweden when it started to benifit men. Feminist in UK blocking the countries only male officer for welfare designed to tackel male suicide and kicking him out of job with the head of NUS women saying sexism against men does not exist (there were several types of officer e.g. womens - even though women are not a minority in uni and are a privelged group, LGBT, BAME etc)  Here is feminists on campus:  There   was a proposal at Simon Fraser University (near Vancouver) to open up a   men's centre on campus to address issues like suicide, drug/alcohol   addiction, and negative stereotypes. The women's centre, which already   existed, opposed this. They argued that a men's centre is not needed   because the men's centre is already ""everywhere else"" (even though those   issues aren't being addressed ""everywhere else""). The alternative they   proposed was a ""male allies project"" to ""bring self-identified men   together to talk about masculinity and its harmful effects"" \[1\].  A   student at Durham University in England, affected by the suicide of a   close male friend, tried to open up the Durham University Male Human   Rights Society: ""\[i\]t’s incredible how much stigma there is against male   weakness. Men’s issues are deemed unimportant, so I decided to start a   society"". The idea was rejected by the Societies Committee as it was   deemed ""controversial"". He was told he could only have a men's group as a   branch of the Feminist Society group on campus. This was ironic since   he point them to the feminist societies own literature which states it   would be extremely unreasonable for them to discuss issues about  men\[9\].  Author  Warren Farrell  went to give a talk on the boys' crisis (boys dropping  out of school  and committing suicide at higher rates) at the University  of Toronto,  but he was opposed by protesters who ""barricaded the doors,  harassed  attendees, pulled fire alarms, chanted curses at speakers and  more"".  Opposition included leaders in the student union \[2\] \[3\].Three  students  (one man and two women) at Ryerson University (also in  Toronto)  decided to start a club dedicated to men's issues. They were  blocked by  the Ryerson Students' Union, which associated the men's  issues club  with supposed ""anti-women's rights groups"" and called the  idea that  it's even possible to be sexist against men an ""oppressive  concept""  \[4\]. The student union also passed a motion saying that it  rejects  ""Groups, meetings events or initiatives \[that\] negate the need  to  centre women’s voices in the struggle for gender equity"" (while   ironically saying that women's issues ""have historically and continue to   today to be silenced"") \[5\].  Janice   Fiamengo, a professor at the University of Ottawa, was giving a public   lecture on men's issues. She was interrupted by a group of students   shouting, blasting horns, and pulling the fire alarm \[6\].  At   Oberlin College in Ohio, various students had invited equity feminist   Christina Hoff Sommers (known for her individualist/libertarian   perspective on gender) to give a talk on men's issues. Activists hung up   posters identifying those who invited her (by their full names) as   ""supporters of rape culture"" \[7\] \[8\].  At   Saint Paul University (part of the University of Ottawa) on September   24th, 2015, journalist Cathy Young gave a talk on gender politics on   university campuses, GamerGate, the tendency to neglect men's issues in   society, and the focus on the victimization of women (in the areas of   sexual violence and cyberbullying). She was met by masked protesters who   called her ""rape apologist scum"" and interrupted the event by pulling   the fire alarm \[10\].  In 2015, the   University of York in the U.K. announced its intention to observe   International Men's Day, noting that they are ""also aware of some of the   specific issues faced by men"", including under-representation of (and   bias against) men in various areas of the university (such as academic   staff appointments, professional support services, and support staff in   academic departments) \[11\]. This inspired a torrent of criticism,   including an open letter to the university claiming that a day to   celebrate men's issues ""does not combat inequality, but merely amplifies   existing, structurally imposed, inequalities"". The university  responded  by going back on its plans to observe International Men's Day  and  affirming that ""the main focus of gender equality work should  continue  to be on the inequalities faced by women"". In contrast, the  University  of York's observation of International Women's Day a few  months earlier  was a week long affair with more than 100 events  On   campuses, feminists oppose men’s  groups and men’s services. For   example, “Fourth-year politics and  governance student Kevin Arriola   launched a new Ryerson [Men’s Issues Awareness Society](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/ryerson-mens-issues-group-says-student-union-shutting-out-male-voices/article27180128/) on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ryerson/comments/3mqvru/introducing_the_ryerson_mens_issues_awareness/) last month and tried to get it certified by the Ryerson Students’ Union. The [Ryerson Feminist Collective](http://theeyeopener.com/2015/11/community-reacts-to-mens-issue-group-at-ryerson/) was quick to condemn the group, saying it ‘unequivocally denounces any organization that makes students feel **unsafe**.’” \[emphasis added\]  “The Ryerson Students’ Union (RSU) [rejected](https://ryersonian.ca/rsu-mens-issues-group-rejected-over-safety-concerns/)a men’s issues group for official status because it was afraid the    group would become a campus haven for misogyny and radical    anti-feminism. … Arriola’s group did not have enough guarantees in its    constitution to prevent it from turning into a **violent** men’s rights activism (MRA) group, according to a document handed out at the meeting.” \[emphasis added\]  Men    are equally left out in Britain. James Knight was the only candidate   to  \[send\] his name forward to be men’s officer at the University of  the   West of England, and said he wanted to highlight male mental  health   issues. However, the National Union of Students officers began a    campaign against the role, and he pulled out after claiming he \[was\]    harassed. The university said the post was suspended pending review.”  opposing mens issues in action:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iARHCxAMAO0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iARHCxAMAO0)  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cMYfxOFBBM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cMYfxOFBBM)  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha2E5aQ7yb8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha2E5aQ7yb8)  blocking mens rights:  [http://archive.is/AWSEN](http://archive.is/AWSEN)  tGreat that you care.

That's delusional self deception.   &gt;   &gt;Listen,  if you want to call yourself a feminist, I don't care. I've been  investigating feminism for more than 9 years now, and people like you  used to piss me off, because to my mind all you were doing was providing  cover and ballast for the powerful political and academic feminists you  claim are just jerks. And believe me, they ARE jerks. If you knew half  of what I know about the things they've done under the banner of  feminism, maybe you'd stop calling yourself one.   &gt;   &gt;But  I want you to know. You don't matter. You're not the director of the  Feminist Majority Foundation and editor of Ms. Magazine, Katherine  Spillar, who said of domestic violence: ""Well, that's just a clean-up  word for wife-beating,"" and went on to add that regarding male victims  of dating violence, ""we know it's not girls beating up boys, it's boys  beating up girls.""   &gt;   &gt;You're  not Jan Reimer, former mayor of Edmonton and long-time head of  Alberta's Network of Women's Shelters, who just a few years ago refused  to appear on a TV program discussing male victims of domestic violence,  because for her to even show up and discuss it would lend legitimacy to  the idea that they exist.   &gt;   &gt;You're  not Mary P Koss, who describes male victims of female rapists in her  academic papers as being not rape victims because they were ""ambivalent  about their sexual desires"" (if you don't know what that means, it's  that they actually wanted it), and then went on to define them out of  the definition of rape in the CDC's research because it's inappropriate  to consider what happened to them rape.   &gt;   &gt;You're  not the National Organization for Women, and its associated legal  foundations, who lobbied to replace the gender neutral federal Family  Violence Prevention and Services Act of 1984 with the obscenely gendered  Violence Against Women Act of 1994. The passing of that law cut male  victims out of support services and legal assistance in more than 60  passages, just because they were male.   &gt;   &gt;You're  not the Florida chapter of the NOW, who successfully lobbied to have  Governor Rick Scott veto not one, but two alimony reform bills in the  last ten years, bills that had passed both houses with overwhelming  bipartisan support, and were supported by more than 70% of the  electorate.   &gt;   &gt;You're  not the feminist group in Maryland who convinced every female member of  the House on both sides of the aisle to walk off the floor when a  shared parenting bill came up for a vote, meaning the quorum could not  be met and the bill died then and there.   &gt;   &gt;You're  not the feminists in Canada agitating to remove sexual assault from the  normal criminal courts, into quasi-criminal courts of equity where the  burden of proof would be lowered, the defendant could be compelled to  testify, discovery would go both ways, and defendants would not be  entitled to a public defender.   &gt;   &gt;You're  not Professor Elizabeth Sheehy, who wrote a book advocating that women  not only have the right to murder their husbands without fear of  prosecution if they make a claim of abuse, but that they have the moral  responsibility to murder their husbands.   &gt;   &gt;You're  not the feminist legal scholars and advocates who successfully changed  rape laws such that a woman's history of making multiple false  allegations of rape can be excluded from evidence at trial because it's  ""part of her sexual history.""   &gt;   &gt;You're  not the feminists who splattered the media with the false claim that  putting your penis in a passed-out woman's mouth is ""not a crime"" in  Oklahoma, because the prosecutor was incompetent and charged the  defendant under an inappropriate statute (forcible sodomy) and the  higher court refused to expand the definition of that statute beyond its  intended scope when there was already a perfectly good one (sexual  battery) already there. You're not the idiot feminists lying to the  public and potentially putting women in Oklahoma at risk by telling  potential offenders there's a ""legal"" way to rape them.   &gt;   &gt;And  you're none of the hundreds or thousands of feminist scholars, writers,  thinkers, researchers, teachers and philosophers who constructed and  propagate the body of bunkum theories upon which all of these atrocities  are based.   &gt;   &gt;You're the true feminist.

Even Pankhurts, look up the white feather.... also sufragettes did not get women the vote!

Dazz316,2020-06-26 15:47:51,fw2mf18,t3_hfxrjz,t1_fw2ivj8,"I'm not defending ""feminism"". I'm saying feminism isn't one single group of people with a single agenda. It's a movement containing all sorts of people with all sorts of different agendas.  I'm not defending the actions that you mention. I'm not sure why you think I am other than you aren't really reading me correctly. I've not said any of your examples are good or tried to defend them.   I'm saying there's prior who consider their actions wrong but still consider themselves feminists, like the example I have earlier.  This has ALWAYS been the case. Look up the suffragISTS who were an alternative to the suufragettes. There're liberal feminists, eco feminists and radical feministist (popular in social media), equity feminism (my example earlier). We're currently in the third wave of feminism too with each wave having an emergence of different groups and different aims and agendas.  You are right those things are bad and I can give you more because we agree those are bad. Where we don't agree is whether or not all feminists are behind or agree with those and whether it's ok to paint such a large group with such a large brush. I think that's stupid and it's the very thing men have to deal with often and they complain about too."

Dont pretend it is. 2) You sound like a fair person interested in non extremism and both sides... hence you are not a feminist. Your coffee shop feminsim is your personal individualised take on feminsim.... no organsiation of feminism exists sharing your view with any power making any decision.... in other words, you are not a feminists and your fairer views mean nothing. Christina Hoff Sommers and Camila Paglia who I massively admire and follow closely, are not feminists.  2) very large numbers of coffee shop feminsits do not hate men and want a more egalitarian appraoch (e.g. when they hear that boys were excluded from the indigenous missing persons report despite being 70% of victims they wont agree).... my point is the whole reason they are fair is because they are NOT feminsits.... they are random coffee shop feminsits making up their own idea of gender equality. Put it this way, im a feminsit.... so do I represent feminsim now?  3) Those people ""who dont hate men"" (and feminism isn't even anti man its anti anyone who isnt a feminsits its vile against women who are not feminits and femininty, almost all anti feminsits women say the worst abuse they have every got in their lives was from other female feminsits)  How on earth have I become what I hate?

Third wave is a joke... it is conused and had no idea what to do so made up problems to keep book sales, professorships, jobs... it also created a gender war, ruined womens lives themselves, blamed men for everything, and a new thing made women into victims of wahhh wahhh air conditioning, wahh wahh mansplaining. and now feminism is about legal supremacy e.g. in Spain, probably worst example of feminsim in the entire world:  I mean feminism has literaly created dystopia there:  [https://youtu.be/-9rCcveEDaw](https://youtu.be/-9rCcveEDaw)  an actual sperate legal system for men and women.

AmuseDeath,2020-06-26 23:03:36,fw433mi,t3_hfxrjz,t1_fw2cavg,"Again, you use the ""not all"" argument, but ignore the core problem of feminism, which is its foundation. Look, there is a movement to help women without the magic and bullshit of feminism. It's called women's rights. You can totally join them and I would be happy for you. I've got a mom, I've got female family members. Women's rights would be great for them.  Feminism is the problem because it's founded on myths and lies used to manipulate emotional vulnerabilities of its members. Rape culture does not exist in this country. Rape in taken very seriously and rapists are punished. It's actually almost the complete opposite now where we live in a False Accusation Culture. Innocent men are being accused of rape and they lose their jobs and reputation EVEN when they are proven innocent. Look at Brian Banks:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Banks_(American_football)#False_accusation_of_sexual_assault  Male Gaze is a silly concept where men stare at women, sexualizing them. Feminists completely ignore the fact that women do in fact ogle at men's bodies as well:  https://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/947/231/b83.jpg  People ogle at attractive people all the time. Get a grip.  The Wage Gap has been proven time and time again that it's a load of turd. There are multiple fair wage laws in place already:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Pay_Act_of_1963  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilly_Ledbetter_Fair_Pay_Act_of_2009  They keep passing the same law over and over again, when the wage gap is not proven and is not even a concept actual economists take seriously. Here's a woman herself saying it's false:  https://www.forbes.com/sites/karinagness/2016/04/12/dont-buy-into-the-gender-pay-gap-myth/#3e92228a2596  What do these things all have in common other than the fact that they are false? They all point the finger at men, or the patriarchy. That's right. It's a very convenient thing to do and it's a battle that will never end because there will always be men in society. It makes it very convenient for them to have a target to blame any of their issues at. Nevermind that the house they live in, the cars that they drive, the phones where they write anti-male rants are all built by... men. They live their lives comfortably because of the very same men that they spread hate against. Nevermind the fact that these people have brothers, sons, fathers and cousins.  So again, feminism is cancer because it's a movement that rejects science, data and reason and instead uses Mickey-Mouse logic where they concoct some anti-male concept and use patriarchy to prove it. If you point all of this at them, they run in circles or they say what you say which is ""it's not all of us!"". They shame other women who criticize feminism as having ""internal misogyny"". Absolutely ironic for a movement that is about women having freedom to only say that if they don't criticize feminism. Feminism also claims a monopoly on gender equality to the point where high-profile members say anyone who isn't a feminist is a sexist:  https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/news/a57173/gal-gadot-feminism/  What a load of turd. Imagine a Christian televangelist saying anyone who isn't Christian is a piece of trash. This is feminist logic.  And never mind feminist's history of racism where they argued that white women should be able to vote over black people. Feminist love to ignore that.  There already is a movement that is there to support women with facts and reason and that is women's rights. You fight for issues that affect women with data and logic, not mythical bullshit feminists use.  Anyways, we write this not to shame you, but to help you out. You may have lived your life assuming what feminism is, but in reality, that's the version of feminism that you've been told. Feminism is akin to a religion where its members are told to believe whatever is needed and any dissent is snuffed out. It claims gender equality, but its practices are quite medieval and anti-intellectual. So again, it's not about ""that's only some feminists"", but rather that the core of feminism is problematic.  To solve gender issues as well as ones about race and religion, we need to practice tolerance in the umbrella of reason and logic. What do racists, sexist and religious fanatics have in common? They lack intelligence and reason. They are impulsive and see the world in black and whites. We need to use data and facts to form our narratives. We need to consider different opinions and voices. We need to be open-minded and logical. Feminism is the opposite of that. It is a roadblock to egalitarianism."

NAWALT_VADER,2020-06-27 19:54:46,fw73eej,t3_hgvf22,t3_hgvf22,"Are you saying it is abuse to show boobs to a child..?    I thought it was generally legal in most places now for a woman to walk around without a top on, though generally most choose not to do so. Aren't women supposed to be able to go topless just as any man can do? Is a woman who chooses to not wear a top now an abuser to anyone who sees her?  That seems odd and not egalitarian.  Where do you stand on women being allowed to go topless? Do you think that is vulgar and should remain illegal because breasts are sexual objects which should be kept out of sight? Or do you think that women should be allowed to go topless, just as men can, because breasts are not sexual objects and should not be shunned as such?  My opinion is that women should be allowed to go topless if and when they want, and doing so should not be punished any more than if a man were to do the same. I do not believe that a woman walking down a city street without a top is abusing anyone because she isn't wearing a shirt. I believe the same about a man walking down the street without a shirt on.  You seem to be suggesting women should not be allowed to do so, and that doing so would be abusive to those around them. That sounds like the sort of backward thinking that limits places where women are allowed to do things like sunbathe or breastfeed.  I agree that the sign the child is holding is done so for salacious reasons, and that part is wrong. The parents of the child in the picture are wrong to put the child in what is seemingly now a sexualized situation. That part is wrong.  I think it is important, though, that we do not argue that seeing boobs is abusive. It is not."

I guess my main argument with your presentation was when you posted a title that stated that a child seeing a woman's breasts would ""be abused"". I agree with you that it takes normalization to correct the problem where women's breasts are seen as vulgar displays. I disagree with you in that I feel your titling of this post contributes to the problem by suggesting the issue of a child seeing breasts is abuse. To me, it appears you are fighting against the solution to the problem that we both otherwise admit exists. You are instead perpetuating the issue and the attitude that is the problem we have identified.  Why?  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;I agree. I hope one day our culture will have evolved to where women can be topless and not be harassed or fined for public indecency  Totally agree.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;I think it should be normalized.

It’s a slow process to change a culture, and I know that normalizing female nipples will probably not happen in my lifetime.  I agree. There are many different cultures attempting to intermingle in many countries now, and each seem to have vastly different interpretations of what modesty means, or how much need there is to adhere to such.  Do you think the intolerance towards female nipples being displayed publicly is due to male vs female sexism, or more accurately described as cultural and religious differences between groups regardless of gender?  In my own personal anecdotal experience, religion and cultural heritage seem to play a bigger factor than gender when a person objects to female nipples.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Then why are you making strawmen arguments?  I'm ... not ..? Sorry ... am I wasting my time attempting to have a conversation with you..?  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Then why are you making strawmen arguments?  Again ... I'm not. What? Did you learn a new word today?  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;I never said it was. Strawman  OH! That was your argument. Well thought out and discussed using a single word. Congratulations.  No, that is not a ""strawman"".  [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/straw%20man](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/straw%20man)  There is no imaginary opposition. Your title in the original post is ""Machismo culture at its finest. So many men in the comments praising this child and hoping he gets abused"" which clearly states that you view the child viewing boobs as equal to the child getting abused.  I say that is not abuse. Your title said it is. Your follow up comments said it isn't. Your accusations of a ""strawman"" are a ""strawman"".  You are funny."
Kore624,2020-06-29 02:40:03,fwbv9ja,t3_hgvf22,t1_fwbrwf1,"&gt; I guess my main argument with your presentation was when you posted a title that stated that a child seeing a woman's breasts would ""be abused"".   Because showing a sexual body part to a child is abuse, and as we’ve both said and agreed: breasts are currently sexualized.   So why do you think it’s not abusive to show a child a sexual body part?   &gt; Do you think the intolerance towards female nipples being displayed publicly is due to male vs female sexism, or more accurately described as cultural and religious differences between groups regardless of gender?  It’s both. Both men and women perpetuate the idea that female breasts are inherently sexual. And the reason is cultural and religious. But I do think men contribute more to the sexualization because they are the ones sexually attracted to them and are the ones who will grope and assault a woman if her breasts are exposed. There are videos of this happening at various concerts and outdoor settings where guys swarm a girl who flashes herself, where guys grab and grope as they walk by a girl in body paint or bikini, etc.   &gt; There is no imaginary opposition. Your title in the original post is ""Machismo culture at its finest. So many men in the comments praising this child and hoping he gets abused"" which clearly states that you view the child viewing boobs as equal to the child getting abused.  So we both agree breasts are sexualized. So how is it NOT abusive to show a child a sexual body part? Would it be abuse to show him a vagina? Would it be abuse to show a little girl a penis? Because in our current culture breasts ARE equivalent to genitals in a sexual context. And many men who are against free the nipple will even say “so that means I can walk around in public with my dick out??”   Yes I believe it would be abuse. If that was your main qualm about this post then can you explain why you *don’t* think it’s abuse?"

FEMINSIT ARGUMENT 1 - USED UNTIL IT FAILED:  Basically  it shows how for years feminist gendered domestic violence by saying  men hit women more. Feminist research furthered this by ONLY looking at  men hitting women and not even asking women if they hit men. However,  this could only last so long... when the researches finally started  looking at it properly like scientists should... the data came out it  and time and time again it showed gender symmetry... feminist tried to  keep up the lie of its only men hitting women as long as possible using  stat manipulation techniques such as not asking women about the  perpetration and even using the biases in police stats.... however,  after a while when the research simply mounted up about gender symmetery  feminist realised the evidence was too overwhelming to deny now... they  started to conceede yes women hit men and there is gender symmetry and  even women hit men more....  SO NOW FEMINSITS HAD TO MOVE TO ARGUEMENT NUMBER 2 SINCE 1 FAILED  so  change goals posts... invent coercive control violence vs non coercive  control violcene... try and make it so yes we now ackoweldge womens  violent just as much as men... however, that violence while bad, ***doesnt count as domestic violence***  (feminsm 101 you cant make it up... feminism mental gymnastics is  amazing).... as it is not under coercive control.... but the problem is  now you have t argue that only men use coercive control.... they did the  same tactics, only ask women about being victims of coercive control  etc....this works there are hundeds of articles on DV coecive control of  women, **as that is ALL THEY LOOKED FOR..... t**he  problem for feminists though is now the data is showing women are just  as much if not more coercive controllers!! This is no suprise use your  common sense, women use all sorts of coercive control form jealously,  controlling, sex etc..... the feminsits are trying to overshadow this,  all research is on female victims and male perps creating a massive  research bias... however many non feminist researchers are doing the  correct unbiased research too!  Some other points from video:  Men  and women are victims of violence just as much as each other. However,  men are not pursuing this with the police hence crime stats are wildy  inaccurate (as well as police and prosecution bias). Men who are victims  of violence by female patners - only 10% of men recognise that  beahviour as domestic violence, while 60% of women can recognise that as  domestic violence due to years of feminst advertising and awareness. So  much more awareness is needed on mens and boys domestic violence (in  young people it is women who are much more violent) so actually the  silent epidemic of domestic violence is male victims"

On the contrary, the notion is not just unsupported but  contradicted by all pertinent findings. Data on either implicit or  explicit ‘gender attitudes’ show consideration towards females by males  either substantially greater than they afford other males—philogyny—or,  at worst, neutrality; this even in special conditions in which it might  be most expected. The failure to find evidence of ‘misogyny’ has been  hidden by eliding the notion with the wider one of ‘sexism’, and in the  absence of support for ‘hostile sexism’, ‘benevolent sexism’ was  hypothesised; but this also has no basis, given the deeply flawed  operational definitions of ‘sexism’ employed in studies. Taken together  as ‘ambivalent sexism’, the mode in which this supposedly causes  harm—stereotyping according to sex (dubbed ‘stereotype threat’)—has been  comprehensively debunked. ‘Misogyny’ and ‘sexism’ have become defined  circularly and are, therefore, entirely non-scientific notions in being  unfalsifiable. However weakly defined, ‘misogyny’ evidently is nothing  but ideological invention: a counter-factual, thereby itself an actually  (anti-male) ‘hostile sexist’ notion and term that should never be  employed in a scientific discourse other than in its investigation as at  best a questionable, highly pejorative construct. Indeed, the use of  the label should be investigated as an expression of misandry.

How ""powerful"" a person might be depends entirely on the context. A rich man negotiating a company buyout is powerful, a poor man begging for quarters is not. A woman arguing pro-choice/pro-life is powerful, a man doing the same is not.  What this woman in the image is doing is confusing economic power with social power, and ignoring the fact that her status as ""powerful"" is in constant flux according to the context she's operating within. It's totally possible to be poor economically and still be an entitled asshat socially.  Disregarding context is the dumbest plague in our times.

It's always circumstantial, it's always anecdotal, and it's always an attempt to paint any kind of bad behaviour, such as condescension, as being due to sexism rather than just, y'know, that person being an asshole.  [Here's a recent example](https://twitter.com/OxfordDiplomat/status/1280295034798178306), and it inevitably gets more publicity despite having absolutely no concrete basis behind it. Just ""things have sometimes been hard, people have sometimes been assholes, I've decided that it's because I'm a woman"".   That it apparently gets worse as you get higher up according to the tweeter might be because less and less is handed to her on a plate.

danmilligan,2020-07-13 15:45:25,fxxsy08,t3_hqef8c,t3_hqef8c,"Well we still have to try to view it from the other perspective. You’re coming from a place of disadvantage, and you’re primed to see those remaining disadvantages while being blind to the advantages. It’s simply a pendulum swing, and we don’t have to stress too much about it as it will come back in time. A short period of female advantage shouldn’t worry us too much after millennia of male power advantage have just ended."
Oncefa2,2020-07-13 16:46:35,fxy0dgj,t3_hqef8c,t1_fxxsy08,"This might be a good argument if it was actually true that woman were historically disadvantaged. Especially by men or for some other reason than biology (by which I mean women are the ones who give birth, not men)."
DanteLivra,2020-07-13 16:54:07,fxy1bd1,t3_hqef8c,t3_hqef8c,"""Men always were on top""  Say that to the billions of men who died in wars for no good reasons.  Say that to fathers who can't even see their kids while their mothers buy herself new shoes with his child support.  Say that to all the men who work on construction or sanitation jobs.  Yeah right... on top."
DanteLivra,2020-07-13 16:57:29,fxy1qgn,t3_hqef8c,t1_fxxsy08,&gt;millennia of male power advantage have just ended.  That's a bit of a stretch.  I'm pretty sure women were happy with their situation when WWII came strolling along.
tit-anus,2020-07-13 17:05:16,fxy2p7c,t3_hqef8c,t1_fxxsy08,"Well two wrongs don't make a right tho. Millenniums of male power is a topic of the past. Isn't is necessary to focus on the contemporary issues tho? I don't think that the actions of men then should be the responsibilities of men now. It does seem to be illogical to the current generations who have lived completely different lives .  You're definitely correct tho ,we should try to view it from multiple perspectives."
tit-anus,2020-07-13 17:06:05,fxy2szp,t3_hqef8c,t3_hqef8c,Can you link the original discussion?
bkrugby78,2020-07-13 17:10:34,fxy3cuy,t3_hqef8c,t3_hqef8c,"To me it depends on which man is saying it.  If the guy who is saying it is the type who is ""we need more shelters for men, boys need positive male role models, we need more groups/organizations that promote men"" and the feminist is disagreeing with that guy, well that is clearly a fucking problem.  However, if the guy saying that is the guy who says ""Women are working too much, a woman's place is in the home, we never should have given them the right to vote"" well that is something else entirely.  Which I don't believe there are as many of this guy anymore.  I do agree with OP that both groups could do more to listen to each other and empathize with their experience.  That is something which is in short supply these days, people are so focused on their own opinion they aren't actually listening to others."

I am a guy,I was never a feminist,but I think there should be more of pro-feminist(not feminazi) stuff here...  Please don't let egalitarians be misrepresented as well with such posts..."
jolivarez8,2020-07-13 18:18:23,fxybxbg,t3_hqef8c,t1_fxy6hmf,"The only good feminists I’ve gotten to interact with have been online and specifically on men’s rights subs interestingly (they seem more like egalitarians that don’t know egalitarianism exists). No one will ever be able to meet or interact with the majority of any group of people so it’s normal to generalize from your experiences. Unfortunately for a lot of guys those experiences have been negative with feminists.   It doesn’t help that feminists do things that negatively impact men on a broad scale either. Like in the US, feminists pushed to define what rape is for men and created a definition that excludes interactions with their primary sexual organ. So now men that need help are less likely to get it because rape stats are not accurate and the government provides less funds to the organizations that could help them. If meninists took actions like defining rape for women as only being forced anal or oral sex I’m sure more people would vilify that group as well since their actions would not be in line with benefitting men, but rather harming women which is not okay."
megaSalamenceXX,2020-07-13 21:10:04,fxyxmgg,t3_hqef8c,t1_fxxsy08,Lol. Even if we agree with your male privilege over a millenial theory ( which is a big big big  stretch) you do realize that what you said sounds like revenge right? And there in lies the problem.   Why do we need to keep the pendulum swinging? Why dont we try to find a solution which eliminates this pendulum in the first place?
DanteLivra,2020-07-13 21:31:42,fxz09eb,t3_hqef8c,t1_fxy6hmf,"The thing about feminists is that the ""good"" feminists never speak out, not even to shut down the female-supremacist ones.  Even on places like MGTOW people are regulating each others."
AmuseDeath,2020-07-13 21:32:11,fxz0bgm,t3_hqef8c,t1_fxy6hmf,"&gt;Please don't generalize feminists.There are some good feminists as well.  Well yea, there are feminists who volunteer at hospitals, clean up trash on the beach and donate to charities sure. But the reality is that feminism cannot co-exist with actual egalitarianism because all feminists are centered on the belief of the patriarchy which means any governance by men is evil and is the source of all problems in society. This is fundamentally a problematic statement that is not only not proven, but actually sexist.  The best response to that is this:  ""We don't need more women CEOs, we need fewer CEOS.""  That is to say that inequality doesn't necessarily become better if a dictator is now female. The core issue is that inequality in the first place, not that the elite person is male or not.  &gt;I think there should be more of pro-feminist(not feminazi) stuff here...  But what is pro-feminist stuff? Like what really needs to be done by feminists? For a group that claims to be for both genders, they sure do a poor job talking about the issues men face such as high rates of suicide, homelessness or incarceration.  If anything, their most prominent members say extremely insane things and nobody, NOBODY calls them out on it:  https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/news/a57173/gal-gadot-feminism/"
bkrugby78,2020-07-13 21:54:03,fxz2xt3,t3_hqef8c,t1_fxytv8h,"I wasn’t there obviously so take what I say with a grain of salt, but she sounds like the kind of feminist who believes men have privilege, their problems are a result of “patriarchy” and they should do better/lean out/center women etc.  Which I think is destructive to the discussion. To her those phrases are harmless but it’s clear that there problems with some of those phrases (especially future is female for those who know where it comes from)."
Beefster09,2020-07-13 23:15:29,fxzc9pc,t3_hqef8c,t1_fxxsy08,"There has always been female advantage in certain spheres. For nearly every instance of ""male privilege"", there is an instance of ""female privilege"" somewhere else.  True, there are plenty of cases where men have held high positions in hierarchies that women were not eligible for. These hierarchical systems that bar women have mostly vanished in the western world, with the last remaining vestiges found primarily in religion. This is also not the kind of thing we have problems with ending around these parts.  But then there's other forms of blatant systemic misandry such as only men being eligible for the draft and generally being treated as expendable when it comes to war. Then there's the issue of mothers being disproportionately favored in custody battles. Divorced fathers are often expected to pay the majority of the bills despite only having their kids on the weekends, which tends to turn them into ""party dads"", further depriving them from meaningful teaching moments and putting undue burden on mothers.  Then there's minor things like dress. Sure, men can go shirtless at the beach, but women have more clothing options at every point along the continuum from casual to professional. Women can wear makeup or choose not to and people will mind their business, but a man wearing makeup will likely be harassed for doing so. Women may be unrealistically expected to be thin, but men also struggle with body issues that aren't talked about much at all.  Sure, men tend to have an advantage in business and tech, but they also are massively discriminated against for anything related to children. Fathers have been known to be harassed and needlessly questioned for watching their own children at the park, while women could easily get away with creeping on a playground without knowing a single soul there."
LXXXVI,2020-07-14 01:31:21,fxzqmgz,t3_hqef8c,t1_fxxsy08,"So, as a presumably white American, would you be up for the pendulum swinging the other way with lynchings, police executions, slavery etc.? I'm sure there'd be plenty of black people who'd do their best to faithfully recreate the conditions black people were living under for centuries. Do you volunteer to be the first one?  The whole thing is about rehabilitation vs revenge. Egalitarianism is about rehabilitation of the system, feminism is about revenge."
LXXXVI,2020-07-14 01:34:42,fxzqz10,t3_hqef8c,t1_fxzc9pc,"&gt; Women may be unrealistically expected to be thin, but men also struggle with body issues that aren't talked about much at all.  Women are expected to be thin. Men are expected to be buff. Being buff requires the exact same level of eating discipline as being thin does and then on top of that the discipline to push yourself constantly and work out like crazy.  An overweight man will have to do the exact same thing as an overweight woman, except once they're done losing the fat, he'll have to put on muscle, which is much more painful."

tit-anus,2020-07-14 03:52:52,fy04j9c,t3_hqef8c,t3_hqef8c,Bruh supporting females doesn't mean oppressing men tho . It kinda seems like your deriving the wrong conclusions. The statements that empower women don't necessarily make less of men tho. Idk you're the expert maybe
Oncefa2,2020-07-14 13:05:52,fy16msx,t3_hqef8c,t1_fxy3v23,"Sure and I think you could find many people opposed to feminism who agree with that.  Feminists themselves, however, do not take this position.  They think men used to oppress women, which isn't just false, but is plain sexist.  Men and women used to work together as a team. And in many ways men took on a much heavier burden than women did in part because of biology."
Alataire,2020-07-15 10:01:51,fy4oq5r,t3_hqef8c,t3_hqef8c,"&gt; I  think that feminists perceive growing gender equality, which is eroding their  advantage, as being persecution because they've always had the view  from the top. So anything empowering men seems to them to be  inherently anti-female and threatening. I believe a similar thing is  happening to the political left. Feminists and TERF groups both have  fear as a huge motivating factor.  Women have lived for years in times when adult women raping 13 year old boys was described by media as ""having sex with"", or claiming that *he* should be lucky to be noticed by this woman. Men who come forward with stories of (sexual) abuse are immediately laughed at, dismissed, or worse they get a counter claim by their abuser that they have abused them. Now feminists are worried that men will be believed too, which is why they have to promote slogans such as ""Believe Women"" instead of ""Believe Victims"", because more and more society starts to realize that men get abused too.  If only feminists treated women as they do men, but it is hard to imagine what it is like to live the world as the other gender, and (academic) feminists don't care about male (representation) in their fields so they will never learn."
