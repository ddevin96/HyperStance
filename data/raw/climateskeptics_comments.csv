I may be wrong, but we'll be finding out within the next couple decades anyway. Drastic action would definitely be damaging to the economies of most nations, especially developing nations. I can't deny that. But if climate predications are correct we may be entering a mass extinction event. That's why people are terrified and want such drastic measures. In the next couple decades (given that climate models are correct), due to quickly increasing surface temperatures, we might see large areas of the globe becoming uninhabitable. This could cause refugee crises beyond anything seen before, and refugee crises can quickly lead to war. That may be more devastating than any of the consequences of taking drastic action towards climate change.  I'm not trying to be an alarmist, but to be honest I'm terrified, especially after seeing NASA's most recent climate model (it was on the front page yesterday I think, but here's the link:  https://www.google.com/amp/s/climate.nasa.gov/news/2943/study-confirms-climate-models-are-getting-future-warming-projections-right.amp)  I don't really think anyone knows the answers because this is easily the biggest problem humanity has ever faced and there are too many factors to be considered. Whatever course of action we take, it's not going to be perfect and people are going to suffer either way."

In the 2019-20 bushfires 4.9M Hectares have burned in NSW ALONE up 10% on the 74 fires which is significant when we're talking about 400,000 hectares,and this will only continue to rise as the fire season still has more than a month to go.

Scrub fires in the NT burn large swathes of land commonly, the reason for that is that the population is small as hell at under 220K people and a land mass of 142,100,000 Ha, and the firefighting strategy is to let it burn unless it is encroaching on a populated area, they simply don't have the manpower to fight them.

If you compare the total HA versus other fires in Australian history not NSW history, it isn't even close.  Okay well my argument was that it was a historical record for NSW, where more than 4.9M Ha have burned, the biggest historical fire in NSW until this year was 74 and it came in at 4.5M Ha. it has been ~10% larger than the historical record, From 45 years ago, before fire relief efforts had satellite date, computers, mobile telephones etc to more effectively fight fires.  &gt;Done  Done."

No, I'm sorry. I really want you to try to get past this misunderstanding, because I think it's causing you to be nasty and sabotage your own cause. Please read my explanation carefully.  I do not believe that there is a wide scientific consensus. Rather, I think there is a small group of noisy people. But even if there was consensus, science does not work by consensus. I have made good efforts to understand what is going on, and my very best attempt to come to a reasonable understanding is that CO2 is probably NOT responsible for changing the climate, at least not in the ways presented. I am NOT paid by the fossil fuel industry.  My advice is to try to understand that people can disagree with you and not be a paid stooge. I don't accuse you of being a paid stooge.  The rest of your comment is just extrapolation from your initial wrong assumption. If you continue like this, you will continue to sabotage yourself and not convince anyone. If your goal is to persuade, you need to start treating the people on the other side of the screen as good-hearted people who have come to different conclusions than you have, rather than paid villains or idiots, etc."
Lamont-Cranston,2020-01-13 13:38:00,fe853qk,t3_eo30z1,t1_fe7zlwb,"&gt;I do not believe that there is a wide scientific consensus.   You could believe that the sun rises in the west but you don't get to be taken seriously. Insisting its rude and nasty and sabotages ones position to not treat such thinking seriously, and you need to be gently coddled and not have your feelings hurt holds no water with me.  &gt;Rather, I think there is a small group of noisy people.  See now here we have the unintentional projection, that's what is going on with the fossil fuel industry pumping huge sums into denial promoting a fringe minority and their think tanks and policy institutes as a legitimate evenly balanced debate.  &gt;But even if there was consensus, science does not work by consensus.   *Skeptics go on to admit that it is both rare and significant when nearly 100% of the scientists in any field share a consensus-model, before splitting up to fight over sub-models. Hence, if an outsider perceives ""something wrong"" with a core scientific model, the humble and justified response of that curious outsider is to ask ""what mistake am I making?"" — before assuming 100% of the experts are wrong.*  *In contrast, Deniers glom onto an anecdotal ""gotcha!"" from a dogma-driven radio show or politically biased blog site. Whereupon they conclude that ALL of the atmospheric scientists must be in on some wretched conspiracy. Uniformly. At the same time.*  *We cannot say too often that, just because nearly all of experts are in consensus, their paradigm might still turn out to be wrong. Still, the Skeptic admits this is rare in science history. Moreover, a steep burden of proof falls on those who claim that 100% of experts are wrong. That burden is a moral, as well as intellectual geas.*  *The Denier, in contrast, cares little about the history of science, and especially has no understanding of how the Young Guns in any scientific field — the post-docs and recently-tenured junior professors — are always on the lookout for chinks and holes in the current paradigm, where they can go to topple Nobel laureates and make a rep for themselves, in a manner much like Billy the Kid. (Try looking into the history of weather modeling, and see just how tough these guys really are.)*  *This is a crucial point: For the core Denier-narrative is that every single young atmospheric scientist is a corrupt or gelded coward. Not a few, or some, or even most... but every last one of them. Only that can explain why none of them have ""come out."" Especially given that Exxon and Fox News offer lavish rewards for any that do.*  *One Denier narrative claims that the experts are corrupted by ""millions pouring into green technologies""... without showing how a space probe researcher, studying Venus at JPL, profits from a contract going to a windmill manufacturer in Copenhagen. But we'll return to conspiracy theories in a bit.*  *No, I am not proclaiming that all young scientists are noble, brave, insightful and incorruptible. On average, most scientists are propelled by adventure, curiosity and macho-competitive guts, but I've known plenty who weren't. Nevertheless, after working with folks in dozens of scientific fields, I know that the best of the Young Guns have the knowledge, tools and ambition to start screaming when they spot ""holes in the consensus."" If all the post-docs and junior-tenureds in atmospheric studies have timidly laid down — and this has also silenced experts in related fields like meteorology — then this is the first time it happened in any large scale field of science. Their acceptance of the AGW model means something.*  *Still, one is drawn to imagine why a Denier can imagine that all the Young Guns are either cowed by authority figures or suborned by greed for measly five figure grants... perhaps because that is the way things work in the Denier's own field? It is a natural human mistake, to assume that others are like yourself. Nevertheless, it remains a mistake.*  *The Skeptic takes the absence of Young Gun dissenters into account, adding it to the burden of proof borne by the other side.*  &gt; I have made good efforts to understand what is going on, and my very best attempt to come to a reasonable understanding is that CO2 is probably NOT responsible for changing the climate, at least not in the ways presented. I am NOT paid by the fossil fuel industry.  But through incredulousness, political bias, the dunning kruger effect, a tendency towards conspiracism, or any number of other psychological faults you reject the scientific consensus and turn to sources funded by the fossil fuel industry.  &gt;The rest of your comment is just extrapolation from your initial wrong assumption.  Having a choice in transit is a wrong extrapolation?  &gt;stop being a meany it hurts my feelings  If you aren't paid then you're suckered in by people who are."

Secondly, you have no way of going and asking everyone with relevant knowledge what they think. If you don't concede that, you have a big problem in your thinking. Just concede the basic fact that you have no way of knowing firsthand. Therefore, we rely on studies and surveys, like the one done by Cook.

Some parts have a net cooling while most parts have a net increase in temperature land thus the average temperature of the globe is increasing. This is not a meaningless statement. If I say “the average person needs an antibiotic when they get a bacterial infection” does that mean that statement is faulty? No. If the average temperature increases that means most parts are increasing in temperature which is a big deal.

My point is alarmists get serially alarmed about many things that serve their interests.   It was DDT in the 60s, acid rain in the 70s, the ozone hole in the 80s and coral reefs in the 90s. The curious thing is these problems disappear when when alarmists move their concerns to the next 'thing'.   So coral reefs are today's thing, they're all dying according to alarmists. What's funny is I live in the tropics facing the ocean and I see perfectly healthy coral reefs out my back lanai less than 100 meters away in the bay, they're  teeming with tropical colored fish.   Most likely you live in a land-locked higher latitude urban area and have never seen a coral reef except on the internet."

Here is a scientific analysis:  &gt;When carbon dioxide dissolves in seawater, the water becomes more acidic and the ocean’s pH (a measure of how acidic or basic the ocean is) drops. Even though the ocean is immense, enough carbon dioxide can have a major impact. In the past 200 years alone, ocean water has become 30 percent more acidic—faster than any known change in ocean chemistry in the last 50 million years.  https://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/invertebrates/ocean-acidification  I've seen coral reefs in two oceans, with fellow disgusted tourists who observed tour guides dropping fish food in the approved viewing area.

Springa_13,2020-01-15 14:00:17,feglyec,t3_eoxvru,t1_fege1oi,"Alarmists are more aligned with a doomsayer perspective that if we do not completely change what we do in a couple of years we are all going to die, conflating issues like Australia bushfires with what they see as our impending doom, not just shit that happens.   Sceptics have usually a wide range of opinions, many people on this sub have differing opinions on climate change, its effects and its causes, but we are still open to dialogue, while many alarmists oppose differing opinions and rather not have a diologue.  I think we can safely say many sceptics believe alternate power sources such as nuclear are inevitable and a natural move for a cleaner world. Many of us wouldn't pick a side on whether anthropogenic climate change is completely true or completely false but would debate the extent at which it occurs.  Than there are people who aren't alarmist or sceptics who are open to debate either way. The whole point of alarmists is that they are usually less educated in climate science and less active in their discussion of the topic. All credible scientists would be willing to debate over it without needing to turn to personal attacks as science isn't consensus, one-dimensional and absolute."

There are clear alarmists - those who claim that mankind is rapidly causing the conditions of ecological collapse, with a resulting extinction of mankind in the near term. They encourage drastic action in the very near term.  These are people who want to jail or even kill anyone who isn't agreeing with the need for drastic action in the near term.    There are skeptics who don't believe mankind has caused much, if any, warming. These people feel that we're not doing anything wrong, that there is zero danger from continuing our current course of action.  Then there are people who fit somewhere in between.  We call them ""lukewarmers.""  I'm one of those.  We figure that mankind is responsible for some measurable warming, and it is very possible that we should address our current methods of generating energy, of transportation, of farming, etc. for the general health of the ecosystem.  We don't think there is an emergency, but that some action is prudent.  \&gt; I imagine most people here are some kind of moderate with a few fringe skeptics and even fewer alarmists   Unfortunately, actual studies have been done, and the number of alarmists is large.  We are starting to have a meaningful number of young people who are being dianosed with depression, including suicidal ideation level of depression, due to the public claims of alarmists who claim that without drastic action, catastrophe is just around the corner.  These claims get a LOT of airtime on mainstream media. The very fact that you know the terms ""climate crisis"" or ""climate emergency"" means that you have been exposed to alarmism.  They want you to be alarmed, to be afraid, so that you will endorse drastic action, so that you will be willing to give up your rights, your money, your way of living, in order to save the world from certain destruction."

monarch591,2020-01-16 02:19:22,feil9o2,t3_enumse,t1_fehix0h,Ok man I just read the analysis and watched an abstract. For a scientific study it is remarkably consistent. Like I said 97.5% of scientists concur that climate change is real and is human induced. 66% of studies being inconclusive is not unusual or controversial as all that suggests is that the studies did not yield enough data to support a scientific consensus. Happy to read more but all I see here is support for my argument.
Zaccarato,2020-01-16 05:40:04,fej16ng,t3_enumse,t1_feil9o2,"Yes, but what I am saying is the 97.5% statistic is wrong as is is only based on 33% of all studies. The fact that the majority (66%) can not and does not come to a conclusion means that no scientific consensus has been reached."
Zaccarato,2020-01-16 05:53:14,fej20bw,t3_enumse,t1_feik553,"Ok, you seem open to be convinced. I am not denying that the earth is getting warmer, nor am I denying that we are pumping more CO2 into the atmosphere. What I am questioning is the link between the two.   There is significant evidence to suggest that in quantities above 200ppm, carbon dioxide becomes saturated and becomes much less effective at warming our planet. Links to papers [here](https://principia-scientific.org/science-confirmed-carbon-dioxide-water-vapor-cool-earth-s-atmosphere/) and [here](https://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/agw-an-alternate-look-part-1-details-c.pdf). This is a point in which scientists who advocate climate anthropocentric change have conceded.   When combined with water vapour, which is the leading greenhouse gas, CO2's effect is minuscule in comparison. Water vapour has a much greater emissivity than CO2 and is 100x more present in our atmosphere.   So we have a gas which it's effect is dwarfed in ""quality"" and quantity by water vapour and doesn't actually heat up our planet significantly beyond a threshold amount. The link between CO2 and temperature is a false cause, because it is impossible for CO2 to be warming our planet beyond what it already is. Even if you don't believe what i've said in regards to CO2 saturation, if it was warming the planet, we would not be seeing the temperature increases that we are, because water vapour makes up to 72% of greenhouse gasses. That's why I don't believe anthropocentric climate change, at least in regards to CO2."
monarch591,2020-01-16 11:16:38,fejgooe,t3_enumse,t1_fej16ng,"The concept isn't that illusive, maybe I'm not explaining it properly but you should review the findings again. There is a video there too if you are still struggling. Cheers"
monarch591,2020-01-16 14:08:26,fejr20n,t3_enumse,t1_fej20bw,"It's a super interesting point and I have heard these statistics about water vapor before. However, even if it is water vapour increase in our atmosphere rather than CO2 it still suggests that it's human induced. This would also correlate with our recent increase in industrial power or at the very least our dramatic lifestyle transformation within the last few decades.   I'm not necessarily dobting the validity of your argument but people reading your response (especially in this subreddit) will doubtless use this information to cast further doubt into if action should be taken. Surely now is the time for action and unity on this matter as effects will only begin to compound and change will cease to become possible."
Zaccarato,2020-01-16 15:08:53,fejwb88,t3_enumse,t1_fejr20n,"We're not pumping massive amounts of water vapour into the atmosphere. Even if we were, it regulates itself through rainfall.   If you agree with me, then the solution isn't decreasing CO2 emissions, which is what we're being told to do on a daily basis, it's figuring out why temperature is increasing so we can combat the true cause."

monarch591,2020-01-18 08:08:59,fepyvw9,t3_enumse,t1_fejwb88,Alright well I think we have enough evidence that our CO2 output has increased on a huge scale so even if it dosent actually insulate the planet as effectively as water vapour it still stands to reason that an increased volume of CO2 in the atmosphere will increase insulation and thus temperature.
Zaccarato,2020-01-18 14:43:51,ferv69a,t3_enumse,t1_fepyvw9,I agree with you. But what i'm saying is that an increase in CO2 does not equate to an increase in temperature because of CO2 saturation. Read the studies I posted to verify that.

Extinctions happen continuously to the point where the vast majority of species that have existed are extinct. It should go without saying that these species have been replaced by others who in return will become extinct. I believe humans are not unique in an evolutionary environment and will continue to adapt until change becomes more suitable for other species.   You are suggesting that l am supporting the destruction of the earth but my faith in evolution as l have explained it is exactly the opposite. What leads you to make such a stupid and irrelevant claim.   What l am concerned about is people like you who seem to have no knowledge of previous human history and desire the immediate collapse, or extinction, of our culture, society and politics that have evolved. You want asteroidal change rather than evolutionary change. And you want it fucking now because you know that like climate change is unprecedented, this next revolution will not turn out like all the previous ones.

The term *baizuo* is related to the term *shèngmǔ* (圣母, 聖母, literally “Blessed Mother”), a sarcastic reference to those whose political opinions are perceived as being **guided by emotions or a hypocritical show of selflessness and empathy.** It describes a naive western educated person who advocates for peace and equality only to satisfy their own feeling of moral superiority.

The Russian Winter: There’s a tongue in cheek saying that you should never attempt to invade Russia in the winter. This is inaccurate. The bulk of Napoleon’s Grande Armee were wiped out through disease - Typhus mainly - not the cold. And Barbarossa was launched in high summer, 22 June. In fact, Hitler wanted to invade around two months earlier but he had to divert troops to Greece to bail out the Italians and Mussolini.  The key thing about Russia is its sheer size. During Barbarossa, the Nazis captured an area of land in Russia six times the size of France, but this still had no effect. Stalin moved his production lines further back into the interior. With the help of American loans - Land-Lease Program - the Russians produced huge amounts of military equipment to send to the front lines.  Hitler thought Russia would crumble quickly. “Kick in the door and the whole rotten structure will come crashing down” he said prior to Barbarossa. Their logistics and supply lines caused their demise - they were too far stretched. When it became a war of attrition, they were doomed. And as they did during Napoleon’s attempt at invasion, the Russians employed a scorched Earth policy of burning and wrecking everything during their retreat, leaving nothing to use for the advancing forces."

However, IIRC, it was never the intention to invade through the Ardennes but rather through Belgium, as the Germans did in WW1. During a meeting with his military generals, one of them suggested the risky strategy of going through the Ardennes. The others did not agree. But Hitler went for it. The Nazis launced diversionary attacks in Belgium and then invaded through the Ardennes. After it's success, he considered himself a genius. Grofaz.   Do you remember the 1st war in Iraq and how Saddam was betrayed by his allies?...  Do you mean Saddam's invasion of Kuwait? Saddam was betrayed by America, or specifically GW Bush. He gave clear signs to Saddam that America would not intervene and then launched Desert Storm in retaliation. I know about that.  Chamberlain and his policy of appeasement was a complete failure, of course. I've read extensively about this. Churchill was dead against it. He knew Hitler couldn't be trusted. Hitler was a bully. You don't appease a bully with kindness, giving him things - Suddetenland - and allowing his to take things - Czechoslovakia, Austria, the Rhineland. You must treat a bully firmly, with a show of strength. Chamberlain's policy fed Hitler's aggressive behaviour, his nationalism, his ego. It did nothing to suppress it.   When Chamberlain returned to London from Munich declaring to the public and parliament, ""Peace in our time"", Hitler did no such thing. In fact, he said nothing and made no mention of peace. Chamberlain was a fool. He perhaps thought he was doing the right thing, but completely misread the situation and Hitler. Meanwhile, Churchill saw it.  Finally, for now, with relation to Neville Chamberlain: It's a little known fact that he had a half-brother in the UK parliament, Austen (Sir Joseph) Chamberlain. He twice served as Chancellor of the Exchequer and was also served as Foreign Secretary. It was during his time as Foreign Secretary that he won a Nobel Peace Prize for his involvement in negotiating the Locarno Pact of 1925, preventing a war between France and Germany. I wouldn't be at all surprised if Neville's policy of appeasement with Hitler was an attempt at emulating his older half-brother. Food for thought! Good chatting as always."

France also offered their support. This was announced publicly in the hope it would deter Hitler from invading. Indeed, he delayed his invasion of Poland for a couple of days to deliberate the situation. Hitler was an Anglophile. As you said, he didn’t want war with Britain. When he took the decision to invade Poland, he didn’t think Britain would act. He hoped they wouldn’t. He was shocked when they did. He went into a rage of disbelief. But while Britain (and France) declared war on Germany, they did not honour their agreement with Poland by coming to their aid. They left the Poles at the mercy of the Nazis. In this regard, they betrayed Poland.   Of course, Hitler tried many times to negotiate peace with Britain. If it were not for the determination of Churchill, Britain would have sued for peace. If you haven’t watched it (or read about it), you should see the movie “Darkest Hour”. This refers to the time when Churchill had just become the new PM and Britain stood alone in Europe against the Nazis. Every other ally had been invaded. It was his, and the country’s “darkest hour.” Churchill had huge doubts and concerns himself about what to do - fight or surrender. It was him alone, his will and determination to fight the Nazi threat, that the war turned out as it did, Britain remained free and independent, and Hitler was finally defeated.  You may also know the story of Hitler’s deputy, Rudolf Hess, who secretly flew to Scotland in 1941 in an attempt to get the Brits to surrender.  I do love history. :)"

Of course, this is nothing new in the history of socialism and communism, where everything has been (and continues to be) sold and marketed to the proles as good, as better, as progress, as a step towards uptopia. In the 20th century, the reality of this promised land, this utopia, this betterment to society, turned out to be somewhere in the vicinity of 100 million deaths (double that if you consider Nazism and Facism as socialist), and multi-millions more brutalised, tortured and oppressed, resulting in millions living in fear, misery and poverty.  It's been made very clear by those at the UN, in their own words via their multiple quotes, that AGW (cLiMaTe ChAnGe) has absolutely nothing to do with the environment or saving the planet from destruction. It's about the dismantling of capitalism, de-carbonising, de-industralising, restricting consumption, and wealth redistribution. In other words, socialism. They couldn't have made their intentions more clear, and exposed the hoax of AGW in doing so, yet it seems to be ignored. Just how much longer will this scam be allowed to continue?

This can be expressed as -log7.  ( the 'p' in pH means the negative log of the concentration of H ions measured in mol in a 1 litre sample of water but l'm just talking about the maths not the chemistry)  Now if you want you could do a few easy calculations on your calculator (or look up som log tables) and check the difference between the number of particles represented by a concentration of log7 and log7.1 and then check the number of particles represented by the difference between log8 and log8.1.   You will notice that the difference is about 30% but the difference between log7 and log8 is 10 times. And the difference between log8.1-log8.0 is 10 times the difference between log7.1-log7.0.   So to add something to a solution at pH8.1 to get it down to pH8.0 requires 10 times more than the amount to reduce it from pH7.1 to pH7.0.  I'm more than happy to be corrected here because this is just off the top of head. But in any case you should be careful when using logs and percentages when comparing absolutes."

As you, I was a great admirer of his until he jumped aboard the climate crisis express. However, I have theory about that and Sir David....  I've recently watched a few of his Blue Planet docos and something struck me. While he unfortunately, but inevitably, drags climate change into the spotlight, he always preempts that by mentioning man's damage to the environment. Putting myself into his shoes: Over the past 40+ years, he would have travelled around the world many times. During that time he would have witnessed first-hand the damage humankind has done to the planet - the rainforests, the rivers, the oceans, animal poaching, animal cruelty, etc. As a passionate conservationist, as Dave is, and as a witness to that, I'd have some despair and deep contempt of man if I were him. And I think that's his issue - he's more of a Malthusian than he is a climate activist. And, as you know, Maurice Strong was a Malthusian, as is Michael Mann, and I suspect many others are too - ie. those standing behind the curtains and pulling strings at the UN. But they disguise that with the facade of CAGW and climate action. Just a theory I've considered."

I’m actually a Malthusian myself in some ways. I think what’s going to happen is eventually we burn through all the easily available fossil fuels, including Antarctica which will be mined for its coal (the Chinese are gearing up for this already), and then the harsh reality of our total dependence on fossil fuels will really start to kick in."

It was Google and Greta that gave me the kick in the ass to look closer at the science and question it.   I lived in the Silicon Valley and worked in ""Big Tech"" and I know a lot of Googlers.   Google becoming Alphabet is about the time that the company jumped the shark because it was overtaken by SJW craziness.   It was a fringe ideology of crazies for most of the decades I lived in the SF Bay Area, but in about 2014 the idealogy had exploded.   By about 2018, I completely stopped use Google search because I consider it evil and extremely biased.  I even stopped talking to my Googler friends because they are basically members of dangerous religous cult and are mentally unbalanced people now. However, I still use Youtube because it's the only place I can get some content.   Those warnings Youtube places under global warming ""deniers"" was a big red flag something was wrong.  Greta's creepy cult-like status among the SJWs was also a red flag.   So, I started looking directly at the science papers.  I looked at the evidence from all sides of the debate.  I was blown away by how many people and institutions I trusted were flat out lying about the ""settled"" science.   The evidence that C02 can be used as a practical way to control to the climate is ridiculous.  No amount of C02 restrictions is going to make a significant positive effect on the climate.  There is actually more evidence the climate has been getting better than getting worse.  The running away caustrafic feed feedback loops have been effectively disproven since the planet has seen much higher C02 levels many times with no feedback effect.  Coral bleaching caused by C02 levels is laughably fake when you look at the actual data. Never again will I blindly trust a pop-culture science show or MSM sources telling me what the science says."

A huge amount of it relies on pretty localized data, much of it American or European and based around tree rings, especially the American stuff. I'd been looking at that and feeling a little uneasy about tree rings. I mean trees can grow old but they're hundreds at best, not thousands of years, and very much local.  Then came Climategate and I tried to debate some 'denier' and downloaded the emails. I was going to school this idiot on how the quotes he was using were out of context or he just didn't understand the science. Hey, statistics is hard maff, right?  Then I read their own fucking words.   Including one of them telling another that his tree rings stuff? Bullshit.

JackLocke366,2020-07-08 04:58:15,fxa7ikd,t3_hnaf9s,t3_hnaf9s,"I saw this posted in /r/science and of course the comment section was full of panic and doom. I'm a skeptic that used to believe in cagw and I'm always looking for things that might show there really are problems, but I've also gotten to a point where when I see an article talking about his bad things are, I like to look into how they've messed up.  The article links to the ""research"" which links to a PDF you can download which has graphs and charts as output from the dataset, most of which compare reference periods of 1950-1980 and 1981-2010. The bulk of the research itself was reconditioning the hadex datset into ""hadex3"" which presumably has more notations for quality of data. Let's just set aside that the data is massaged and assume it was massaged in good faith and under sound scientific principles. Let's also set aside cherry picking 1950-1980 which is known to be a period containing half a degree of cooling in the northern hemisphere.  The article itself goes astray from the research in it's interpretation. It does this thing I've noticed often where it'll say that things are definitely worse, but doesn't really say how much worse or how that worseness effects us.   The main claim is ""extreme heat and rainare happening more often"". The two questions that should pop out are 1) how much more often and 2) how much more extreme. If there's 3 cases of 0.5° hotter weather, that does mean much. Hell, if there's 30 cases of 0.5° hotter weather, it doesn't mean much.  The article shows a picture that says ""warm days"" and shows how these are trending up. In fact, the text kind of implies that these are days above 25°C. But when you look at the research, that graph is ""number of days above the 90th percentile for that day"". Something not obvious is if the 90th percentile for that day is -20° and the day is -19.9° then it's above the 90th percentile. Not exactly ""warm"". This includes spring and fall where a temperate 15° could be above the 90th percentile. This is what is considered ""extreme"" by the article.  So what about the effects? That's what really got me. Looking at effects, it's seen that the Growing Season Length for almost the entire world has increased by less than 10 days (figure s10) between the reference periods. Very different than reports of winters shrinking to nothing.  The research also shows very modest changes in the crop specific drought index (csdi). For most of the globe this has dropped by less than 5 days, and it seems like a lower number is better here (figure s16)."
JackLocke366,2020-07-08 05:05:07,fxa827q,t3_hnaf9s,t1_fxa7ikd,"The research shows extreme temperature range (ETR) is down across most of the globe. This is in line with the idea that global warming is making winter's hotter while summers don't move a lot.  Rain has some places more some places less, but almost everywhere less than 4mm/day increase between reference periods. That's 1cm per 25 days. And even here, I have to ask what the practical meaning of this change is. CSDI seems like it's a better track of this unless we really think 3.5cm of rain a year is a catastrophe."

It increases some between the reference periods but when you look at the chart including 1900-1950, it's pretty much flat (figure s20).  Days with more than 10mm rain (figure s21) has a slight trend up, with some places up and some places down. Overall, most places with a change have less than 2.5 extra days. It doesn't look so extreme to me.  Days with more than 20mm (figure s22). Even less of the glbe here because most places never see more than 20mm in a day. In places where it changed, on average there's less than 1 extra day. Less than 1 day.  ""Extreme heat and rainare happening more often""? Yes, but actually no."

All my favourite north island vineyards are thriving.    I didn't really read the data because it appears to be another dataset where they mash global data together and massage it to get results.  But when you look at regional data and include all dates it just doesn't match up. Even with their random dates it doesn't match up.  Certainly not in the US.  Rainfall data is much harder to fudge and I would tend agree with their findings there probably.  What is their definition of Extreme? W1Qß£ 0.1 or 0.3 on a single day? Certainly not extreme.  Even 2 or 3 degrees is hardly extreme.  The early 1930s had years of high temps.  Not specifically extreme but for very long periods.

There is abundant evidence to suggest the planet's climate is changeable. There is evidence the climate has changed in the past. There is pretty solid evidence these climatic cycles of change are natural.  Mostly, I don't buy into the climate changer cult because no one really does. It is obvious the leaders and gurus of the movement -- without exception -- are living their lives as if they were certain it was a fraud.  You have your chief science officer B.H. Obama. Mr. O used to predict sea levels rising and doom but he lied. Obama still bought a $15 million seaside mansion.  You also are burdened with that idiot Algore. Gore is living like he does not believe any of the lies in his discredited movie. Even that green globalist goblin Greta isn't on board with anything but the crass celebreality of climate change.  Greta's scientific expertise transferred to her commentary on Covid-19 and now has moved onto BLM issues.  I don't believe the absurd demand for so-called deniers to present evidence. This assumes the denier is a hollow and evil fellow unless he can prove his case.  Why should he prove it? Is he judge, jury, prosecuting officer, hangman? He proves enough, indeed, when he shows by his blasphemy that this or that idol is defectively convincing—that at least one visitor to the shrine of climate change has come into the church and examined the relics and listened to the preachers and seen the fools praying to their carbon idol and he is left full of doubts.  The fact is enormously significant. The existence of deniers indicates that instinct has somehow risen superior to the shallowness of hoax science, the refuge of fools.  The pedant and the priest have always been the most expert of propaganda. These climate cultists are the most diligent disseminators of nonsense and worse. The liberation of the human mind has never been furthered by credulous cowards.  Society never advances by people getting on their knees; it has always been furthered by happy fellows who heaved dead cats into sanctuaries and then went off merrily down the highways of the world, proving to all men that doubt, after all, was safe—that the god in the sanctuary was finite in his power and hence a fraud.

deck_hand,2020-07-08 20:16:09,fxclh00,t3_hnfssi,t1_fxchj59,"You've replied to a couple of my comments, so I'll try to address them accordingly.  If one looks at the predicted effects, they go from very mild (1.5 degrees ECS decades after a doubling) to very harmful (6 degrees of warming a few decades after a doubling).  Because of the logarithmic nature of GHG based effects (where each new level of CO2 has a smaller effect than the preceding similar amount), we know that halfway to a doubling we've already seen more than half of the direct effects of the GHGs.  This is known science, and not at all controversial.    Also, we have empirical evidence that the direct effects of additional CO2 should be right around 1.1 degrees per doubling.  Again, this is taken directly from the literature.  Still with me?  It follows that anything outside of those direct effects depend on the so-called feedbacks that warming might have.  That's ""any kind of warming, from any source"" since they are the effects of warming, not the effects of the chemical CO2.  Still with me?  Now I have some quibbles with our current temperature assessment, when compared with the reported temperture of the last 15 decades, and those quibbles are due to a large difference between reporting sites then  and now, method of data collection, and adjustments that have been made to historical records.  The current crop of Climate Scientists claim an accuracy of 0.05 degrees in our current global temperature anomaly, due to the large number of readings.  Individual stations, however, regularly see adjustments of well over a full degree, and anomalous  readings of several degrees have been discovered.  There was one from last year, I think, maybe earlier this year, of an all time heat record from an airport in France or Germany.  Turns out, that record was spurious, because none of the sensors anywhere near it recorded record temperatures, and it was found that a jet was warming up it's engines during the reading, with the jet exhaust pointed directly at the sensor.  We saw huge media coverage of the record reading, and very little coverage of the discovery that it was spurious.  So, color me convinced that human influenced surface temperature change is real.  Color me skeptical that it is civilization ending catastrophic in the near term, as measured in the next few decades, or globally catastrophic to the ecosystem in the medium term.    As to Miami being subjected to severe flooding in the next 3 decades... here's [the official tide gauge record of Miami from NOAA](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_station.shtml?id=8723170).  The alarmists will tell you that we had 3mm per year of sea level rise globally 30 years ago, and it's accelerating.  The tide gauge data shows that Miami has a long term trend of 2.3 mm per year since the 1930s, and it does NOT seem to be accelerating. And sense the tide gauge there seem to stop years ago, here's [nearby Key West](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_station.shtml?id=8724580), showing a bit of acceleration in the last 15 years, but at a smaller slope than the acceleration that was shown between 1925 and 1950, when humans were annually producing about 5% of the CO2 that they have been in the last few years.  It is really hard to predict emissions levels from these sea level trends.  Would you be able to show a 20 fold increase in emissions, from this data?  I sure don't see it.  And, Miami has been seeing ""severe floods"" for 100 years.  Yes, they are a bit more frequent now, but, we also live in a much larger footprint now, and have a very different water management scenario now than we did in 1920.  It's hard to blame our current increase in occasional flooding on nothing but 20 cm of SLR over the last century.   Assuming we don't have a complete break in trend, what do you predict the SLR will be off the Florida coast over the next 3 decades?  I predict... 75 mm.  Scary."

Siberia is having a spectacular heat wave, much like Alaska did a few years ago.  Is the heat in the Arctic due to CO2 trapping IR as it's leaving?  Let's see what NOAA has to say about it:  &gt;In February and March 2019 (Fig 3b), strong, warm winds from the south over the Bering Sea greatly retarded sea ice advances (see essay [*Sea Ice*](https://arctic.noaa.gov/Report-Card/Report-Card-2019/ArtMID/7916/ArticleID/841/Sea-Ice)) and moved warm air northward along the international date line into the central Arctic, as in winter 2018. The lower atmospheric wind pattern (Fig. 3b) was connected to patterns higher in the atmosphere (the polar vortex; Fig. 3d) that contributed to the persistence of the wind pattern over Alaska and the remainder of North America.  According to scientists, strong, warm winds blew in from the south all the way up to the central Arctic,increasing the temperature of the Arctic to about 4 degrees above normal.  Is this Polar Vortex unprecedented?  Did we just coin that term?  Nope, we've known about polar vortexes for decades.  [The polar vortex was first described as early as 1853](https://books.google.com/books?id=Df4vAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA430&amp;dq=%22polar+vortex%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22polar%20vortex%22&amp;f=false).

travelingsucks,2020-07-09 10:32:53,fxer9zk,t3_hnfssi,t1_fxb13cd,"Yes what you have stated is somewhat correct the Earth's climate does change naturally through glacial (cooler) and interglacial (warmer) periods. Currently, the Earth is naturally in an interglacial period since the end of the last glaciation, around 10 ka (thousand years) ago. However, the average surface temperatures of the current interglacial are now being significantly enhanced by anthropogenic climate change, especially at high latitudes. You appear to base your perceptions and reach conclusions of your surroundings through the concept of *""anti intellectualism.""*  &amp;#x200B;  **Anti**\-**intellectualism** is hostility to and mistrust of intellect, intellectuals, and **intellectualism**, commonly expressed as deprecation of education and philosophy and the dismissal of art, literature, and science as impractical, politically motivated, and even contemptible human pursuits.  &amp;#x200B;  Climate change is a byproduct of anthropogenic impacts on the Earth system. What you are essentially denying in refuting the existence and anthropogenic climate change, is the concept of the Anthropocene. These are excerpts taken from a research paper I had to write a few weeks back. If there is data that is not cited in the paper it is because it is considered 'common' knowledge in my course and my professors don't require citation of such things as this paper was not for general public use. I will happily pull sources if there is a sentence or phrase you feel need referencing.  &amp;#x200B;  ...just for context I'm studying a Masters degree in Climate Change and Development...  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  *To understand the Anthropocene and assess its potential in combatting global environmental change, we must first address what the term entails and how reconstructing former environmental conditions aid in proving its magnitude, scope and legitimacy. The Anthropocene is an informal geological epoch created to emphasize and mark the transition in Earths history from the Holocene into the proposed current and most recent geological period which has been heavily influenced by human activities. The idea is supported by a systems analysis approach in which the Earth is perceived as a system comprised of highly complex and interconnected components working in conjunction, otherwise known as the ‘Earth system.’ The foundational claim for the Anthropocene is that the Earth system consisting of the geosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere have had their natural processes significantly impacted as a direct result of human activity thus shifting the Earth into a new geological epoch. The term ‘Anthropocene’ was originally proposed by Paul Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer in 2000...*  &amp;#x200B;  *To determine the existence of the Anthropocene, indicators linking human activity with environmental change must be laid out and analyzed for their correlation and temporal proximity.*  *Novel indicators such as fertilizer use, biodiversity loss, global warming, nuclear weapons, and new anthropogenic materials are able to assist in determining and identifying the scope human activity has had on the environment (Waters et al., 2016). The Earths nitrogen cycle is one area showing extreme perturbations as a clear result of human influence primarily from enhanced fertilizer use. This has been discovered through methods of analyzing ice core samples where former atmospheric and climatic conditions can be reconstructed and dated as far back as 800,000 years. Annual layers form within the ice much like that of tree rings thus correlating specific layers of ice to a specific period assisting in reconstructing the atmospheric component of the Earth system. Using trapped air bubbles in ice samples it has been determined that reactive nitrogen has increased 120% when compared to that of the Holocene (Galloway et al., 2008). Canfield et al. even goes so far as to argue that since the formation of the current nitrogen cycle some 2.5 billion years ago, humanity, as a primary result of intensified fertilizer use, has had the largest impact (Canfield, Glazer and Falkowski, 2010). This aligns with the indicators for the Anthropocene as the Haber-Bosch process of manufacturing fertilizers arose in the early 1900s and fertilizer use exponentially increased around the 1950s (Galloway et al., 2008). Combustion of fossil fuels has also contributed to perturbations in the nitrogen cycle though not on the scale of fertilizers.*  *Mass biodiversity loss is another indicator of the Anthropocene. It has been widely debated over the past decade whether we are currently in the “sixth mass extinction.” Ceballos et al. claim ""evidence indicates that current species extinction rates are higher than the pre-human background rate” (Ceballos et al., 2015). Using a historical records method from paleontological databases and written records of observed wildlife extinction dating back to the 1600s, former conditions of the biosphere can be reconstructed to assess that specific component of the Earth system. With that reconstruction extinction rates are able to be quantified and compared alongside current rates. It was determined that “the total number of vertebrate species that went extinct in the last century would have taken about 800 to 10,000 years to disappear under the back ground rate” of extinction prior to 1900 (Ceballos et al., 2015). While it is not fully aligned temporally with the mid 20th century start of the Anthropocene, its relative position can be seen coinciding with a drastic mid century shift in human activity.*  *Global warming is the most popularized and well known indicator linked with the Anthropocene. Its effects are widespread across all the Earth spheres but one change in particular is of extreme concern as it drives climatic conditions, and that’s oceanic warming. To reconstruct former oceanic conditions such as temperature, researchers are using coral skeletons. Living coral colonies can contain centuries of paleoclimatic information as the composition of coral skeletons vary with impacts from environmental conditions such as temperature and salinity (Eakin and Grottoli, 2006). Tierney et al. through current data tracking of coral colonies and reconstruction methods of coral records across the Indian Ocean, Western Pacific, Eastern Pacific, and Western Atlantic was able to determine a trend in oceanic warming. “For all basins, reconstructed temperatures for the most recent 50 years are higher than any other previous 50 year period” (Tierney et al., 2015). This trend in oceanic warming correlates with the start of the Anthropocene and can be identified as a feedback to human activities such as fossil fuel consumption and change in land cover and use.*  &amp;#x200B;  Sources:  Canfield, D., Glazer, A. and Falkowski, P., (2010).

There is no question in my mind that my country, Canada, would vastly benefit from warming, the more the better. We have the second largest land mass in the world but the vast majority of that land is frozen tundra. It is also worth noting that the most powerful greenhouse gas is water vapor, and there is a maximum effect of the greenhouse effect in that it can only trap up to 100% of the suns rays.  So areas which are already very hot, and presumably would not benefit from getting hotter, will in general be affected less by carbon emissions (especially if they are very humid), because they are already at a maximum greenhouse effect due to water vapor already.  But areas which are very cold will be impacted by global warming, presumably to their benefit.     Of course there will be losers as well, coastal cities might face some problems (not necessarily insoluble ones, as Amsterdam and New Oreals demonstrate). But the earth has been warming, much to our benefit, since the last glacial period.  It does not seem obvious to me that more warming is necessarily a bad thing."
BigFuzzyMoth,2020-07-11 15:05:10,fxolpn9,t3_hp7uao,t1_fxodszo,"Most definately not. The media, by and large, clearly favors publishing scary, alarmist, sensational climate pieces. Don't fool yourself. You know I am right. Most mainstream coverage of climate routinely chaulks up any skepticism of alarmist predictions as stupid anti science ""deniers"" or fossil fuel funded. It is truly rare to see a mainstream piece even analyze or try to rebut the central arguments or concerns of skeptics. Usually, logical falacies like appeals to authority or majority are used to cast aside skeptical concerns. Again, I  talking about media reporting on climate, not so much climate scientists themselves. There is a growing divergence between the science and the journalism that covers it in that the coverage usually amplifies only the most scary aspect of a study while ignoring important context or other aspects which undercut the alarm. For example all the talk over the last couple years of the IPCC's most extreme model, RCP 8.5  misleadingly labeled ""business as usual"", was never meant to represent a ""likely"" but rather a worst case scenario based on assumptions of exponential increase in carbon emissions (which is not happening). Only now after that model has diverged more and more from reality (actual observations) are most journalists beginning to drop their coverage of it. But that doesn't reverse the hundreds of times it has been used in media as an example of what we should expect."

Science takes in data with our flawed human senses and establishes best guesses. It is fundamentally routine to science that previous conclusions are over-ridden with new evidence - it happens every day - hence, *best guess* and not objective truth.   Climate science takes it one step further and in my approximation can not be even considered science as it does not even follow the scientific model. “Proving” your hypothesis with your own deterministic computer models is not science."

YehNahYer,2020-07-12 20:00:49,fxuywjl,t3_hpuaoi,t3_hpuaoi,Ed Berry's papers are important for several reasons.  It's kind of like several papers in one.  It can be broken into two main parts.  The first part is how he shows the IPCC version of the carbon cycle disproves itself by being contradictory.  There is several reasons not just one as to why it falls apart. Even a single one of the multiple reasons it is flawed break their whole theory.   This is independent of his physics model which is a simple physics model of the CO2 cycle that can replicate empirical data and past data.  Something the IPCC model can't do.  It follows on from others work on similar physics models.  No one has been able to disprove his model.    There is no imagination or super powers of individual gases like CO2 required.  So it is at the very very least highly plausible.  The logic behind it also tracks that CO2 follows temperature rise as it has also done in all history.

ElCorazonMC,2020-07-12 22:44:22,fxvgtes,t3_hp8duu,t1_fxqvgjv,"What you want to identify as a frontal contradiction within my previous post is a notion of nuance.  &gt;A consensus is not science.  I agree.  &gt;To paraphase Einstein's view on concensus and peer review ""all it takes is for one person to be correct"".  Totally agree.  What are we discussing here?As much as I would like to debate climate science on the deepest ground basis with you, we will probably not reach the level of the debates between Einstein and Bohr, and the yet pretty much still unsolved questions of causality and hidden variables in quantum theory.  Do you question the greenhouse effect? The data gathering plotting of the IPCC? The intern politics that lead to the establishment of its conclusions? Its projections? The mitigations and adaptation recommendations?  To come back to the consensus part, it was historically AGW theory that was the minority in climate science, and it took a great long time to reach consensus. This is the same dynamic that happened with Galilee and their cartesianism during the end of middle Age. The fact that people have come to a consensus is far from a proof in itself, just a slight indication that most people think the problem is solved.  &gt;Also there isn't actually any concensus.  I wholeheartedly disagree. I consider even this as a refutation of the reality of the state of climate science. From all the sources that I could read, climate science has unequivocally reached a consensus on the existence of AGW.  &gt;It's based on just 65 papers.  Not even the full papers.  Just the abstracts.  You might have wanted to link some material to this assertion, I could not find anything on it. I could find for example in the IPCC AR5 The Physical Science Basis fact sheet, that there were ['Over 9200 scientific publications cited'](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/03/WG1AR5_FactSheet.pdf).  I find it funny, on the side, that you wrote consensus 'concensus', not to mock you by the way. The latin lexem 'cens' - contrary to 'sens' which refers to meaning, has to deal with money and taxes, as in 'census suffrage' : it expresses to me quite well how AGW is linked at its core to social inequality."

This is because the stomata of the plant stay open for a shorter time because the plant can acquire the CO2 it needs from the atmosphere quicker. Since the stomata are open a shorter amount of time, The moisture content of the plant is retained internally rather than transpired away. The plant uses LESS water. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I also point out that There is such a thing as the Einstein A coefficient. It is a factor that is used to calculate the elapsed time for an excited molecule to emit a photon. This exists because a CO2 molecule emits  a photon on average every second as it decays. However the time to de-excitation in the lower troposphere is actually around 1 ns. A factor of about a billion to one, caused by collision with other atmospheric particles.   If you discuss this with Alarmist physicists they will say that the time to decay follows an exponential curve and so the decay time happens instantaneously in spite of one of the reasons that Einstein won Nobel Prize for his discoveries. Nonetheless the decay time actually exists outside the exponential curve and with a specific time in spite of the wishes of alarmist physicists.  I Do not think Herr Professor Doktor Einstein plays dice with the universe. Of course there is a peer reviewed paper that addresses this exact problem. The decay exists because of probability varying  along two different decay timelines. When you measure one the decay does not occur. You go to measure the other and the decay does not occur either until Einstein's postulated time.  Quantum mechanics might indeed play dice with the universe. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  We have observed persons posting here who always come up with additional theories to claim that the conversion of IR to heat is faster than previously calculated. In some cases the IR quanta are converted from photons to atmospheric heat twice in violation of the law of conservation of energy. In other cases the IR photons are directed back toward the Earth thus their energy is used a second time to retard the cooling of the atmosphere. This again is a violation of the law of conservation of energy. Actual physicists or students of physics make these claims of perpetual energy schemes in the atmosphere."

It also turns out that the question Reiss put to Hansen for the book *The Coming Storm* was to **speculate about his office window view 40 years in the future** (btw, that would be the year 2028) - not to predict - **under the premise (!) that CO2 would double** during that timeframe.

For station data to be useful for such studies, it is essential that the time series of observations are consistent, and that any non-climatic temperature jumps are eliminated; those may be introduced by station moves or equipment updates or by combining reports from different sources into a single series. In the adjusted data the effect of such non-climatic influences is eliminated whenever possible. Originally, only documented cases were adjusted, however the current procedure used by NOAA/NCEI applies an automated system that uses systematic comparisons with neighboring stations to deal with documented and undocumented instances of artificial changes. The processes and evaluation of these procedures are described in numerous publications — for instance, Menne et al., 2018 and Venema et al., 2012 — and at the NOAA/NCEI website. Uncertainty arising from the statistical method used to remove artificial changes is accounted for in the confidence interval on the global mean.   https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/faq/"

Climate researchers like myself are the biggest pushers for climate change; most politicians have an affinity for listening to experts. You’re really wrong when you say there is no evidence for global warming and even more wrong when you say there’s tons to disprove it.

YehNahYer,2020-07-14 18:07:29,fy25wg2,t3_hqk95x,t1_fy0geeo,Consensus is the opposite of how science works.  Science is built on skepticism.  This skepticism creates a consensus naturally if applied correctly.  A consensus based on opinion isn't science.

YehNahYer,2020-07-14 19:42:48,fy2hzav,t3_hqk95x,t1_fy2g0qk,You are contradicting yourself.  Consensus is not science.  Also there is no consensus.   https://wattsupwiththat.com/2017/12/22/is-the-97-climate-consensus-fake-news/  The 97% consensus figure is based on the abstract of 65 papers and is based on only actively publishing authors of the time.  Many from that time are no longer actively publishing so that study is now defunct.  Surveys of actual organizations with 1000s of responses show there is no concensus.  There is infact a wide variety of opinions and this is in an organization that supports the claim of AGW.
YehNahYer,2020-07-14 19:51:10,fy2j1j8,t3_hqk95x,t1_fy2d411,Because they don't cite a source for their claims of concensus.  The source is obvious though because only one source claims 97% concensus.  A now outdated and debunked source.  Even if it was factual it is based on the abstract of only 65 papers which isn't enough to be Representative of scienctists.  There is a signatory list of scienctists who disagree with the consensus.  It has 32000 members.  The opposing list which agrees with the supposed consensus only has 11000 members.  So 65 vs 32000 or 32000 vs 11000.  Clearly shows there is not a consensus.  Also real surveys show there isn't either.  You are just linking to a website not anything in particular as your evidence.  Post a paper with said evidence.  Those links are just one persons opinion at the Goddard institute.  An institute that only gets funding if there is AGW.

HIVVIH,2021-11-19 20:46:02,hlawg19,t3_hpuaoi,t1_fxuywjl,"CO² doesn't decay like ¹⁴C. If there is more ¹⁴C, there's more decay. So it does balance indeed.   Stored CO² (oil, gas, charbon) is released in the atmosphere by burning it. Increasing the CO² in circulation. Higher levels of CO² in circulation don't translate to more CO² being taken out of circulation.  Yes, nature absorbs more co2 as atmospheric concentrations rise, but that doesn't mean it's taken out of circulation. An example is ocean acidification."
YehNahYer,2021-11-19 21:23:42,hlb26j9,t3_hpuaoi,t1_hlawg19,Ed Berry specifically addresses this in this paper.  Nature does not treat duman CO2 differently from natural CO2 if that is what you are implying.  Your example doesn't make sense.  It's a contradiction.  If the ocean is indeed acidifying that means 100% the carbon is being taken out of circulation by definition literally.  If get what you are saying though that humans are contributing to added CO2 and it would stay in the atmosphere for a limited period of time.  Again addressed by Berry's physics model.  Humans are adding extra CO2 but the majority of extra CO2 in the atmosphere is from natural ocean outgassing.  The oceans can never acidify due to near unlimited buffers.  The recorded average change in acidity from 8.1to 8.1 is well with margins of error considering all factors that can effect pH levels.  In a single day just the temperature differ6 between day and night changes PH by up to 1.  Oceans can be anywhere from 7.2 to 8.6 all I'm the same spot over a single day so for any average to be meaningful it would need to be a far bigger change.  And change we will never see.
HIVVIH,2021-11-19 23:11:06,hlbhtgw,t3_hpuaoi,t1_hlb26j9,"Where did I imply that hahahah?  Why would I insinuate nature treats 2 identical molecules differently?  Ocean acidification is proof that CO² absorbed by the oceans can't be treated as 'out of circulation'. As it is directly affecting the livability of our planet.  It's called average for a reason. And btw, pCO² levels in the oceans are steadily on the rise as well, inversely proportionally to the pH level. Berry is not a scientist."
YehNahYer,2021-11-21 08:26:17,hlhl2sx,t3_hpuaoi,t1_hlbhtgw," &gt;Where did I imply that hahahah?  Why would I insinuate nature treats 2 identical molecules differently?  Then explain what you mean with the C14 comment.  You didn't explain it. &gt; &gt;Ocean acidification is proof that CO² absorbed by the oceans can't be treated as 'out of circulation'. As it is directly affecting the livability of our planet.  It's literally out of circulation in the atmosphere... But I get what you mean.... Technically all carbon is in circulation by your logic though.  Again it's not proof because PH levels change naturally and always have.  So how would we know the change isn't natural.  Also you would first need to prove extra CO2 is not natural, which has not been done.   I don't think you have a very logical mind if you can't see that missed step in your logic.  Ed Berrys model does allow for human influence and the levels are negligible even more so when it comes to acidification.  You also don't understand buffers or chemistry.  There is a huge buffer.  Almost no amount of CO2 even if we burnt all known stockpiles of CO2 today acidification would not occur.   &gt; &gt;It's called average for a reason. And btw, pCO² levels in the oceans are steadily on the rise as well, inversely proportionally to the pH level.   Again you arn't making sense. PCO2  on the rise? Load of shit.  They would need to be 3x larger than alarmist guesses for them to be considered outside margins of error.  Even then you could not distinguish between natural or man made.  Serioualy did you just say inversely.  Wyd is wrong with you.  I think pwehapsnyou might be suffering nsomw brain damage so I should be nice...  I'll just say nothing.  &gt;Berry is not a scientist.  Ok I was going to be nice because you are clearly mentally challenged but fuck it ..  ED berry is the definition of scientist.
