2econd7eaven,2019-10-26 22:00:48,f5bxeun,t3_dnkf4w,t3_dnkf4w,Your Grandparents don’t know either. They are like people back in the day not knowing how much slaves suffered under  slave owners and buying products from them. In this case the slaves are the animals.
Laetitia94,2019-10-26 22:05:35,f5bxu4h,t3_dnkf4w,t1_f5bxeun,Yes but they were the adults.anf should have know better. When i was 12 i already hated circusses and zoos and never went anymore.  I was old enough to see the lies that were told to me.
2econd7eaven,2019-10-26 22:11:02,f5byni0,t3_dnkf4w,t1_f5bxu4h,If u have a good relationship with your grandparents I would recommend talking to them. I am serious older generations have completely different morals and don’t even really think about stuff like that. And if u ever get kids don’t go to circuses with animal and support the ones that don’t.
Laetitia94,2019-10-26 22:13:55,f5bz6v2,t3_dnkf4w,t1_f5byni0,They already died u fortunately. But j still have anger.
2econd7eaven,2019-10-26 22:23:06,f5c0aup,t3_dnkf4w,t1_f5bz6v2,That’s sad. I could talk to my grandparents about the topic and my parents are fortunately vegetarians. Do you have any Idea how you could lose this anger and if I can help? It always makes me very sad when people can’t forgive dead people or have anger towards them.
averyboringbunnymom,2019-10-27 00:36:25,f5cksc6,t3_dnkf4w,t3_dnkf4w,"I’m not sure this is fair. Yes, as adults they should have seen how horrible zoos are, but with that perspective you can hate every single adult who is not vegan for not seeing all the harm they’re doing. I suggest making your peace with the past. It was unfortunate, but it’s done."
Laetitia94,2019-10-27 00:40:49,f5cldje,t3_dnkf4w,t1_f5cksc6,Well that is a bit different isnt it. They were the people.that raised me. Not the millions of others that are not vegan. Furthermore you dont have to be a vegan to boycot circusses.
averyboringbunnymom,2019-10-27 00:46:40,f5cm5mf,t3_dnkf4w,t1_f5cldje,"Most vegans aren’t raised vegan, but I don’t think that’s a reason to hate your guardians. I’m sure they did the best they could. If it really bothers you, you may benefit from seeing a therapist? It really helps to talk through these types of problems since unfortunately your grandparents aren’t here anymore to discuss that."
Laetitia94,2019-10-27 00:49:43,f5cmk70,t3_dnkf4w,t1_f5cm5mf,I didn't say i hate them did i. I said i still.have ager towards them about that.
rbep531,2019-10-27 01:15:25,f5cpxu2,t3_dnkf4w,t3_dnkf4w,"It was such a different time, though. There was no internet and information wasn't so easy to find. Shit, my grandpa started smoking back when there were ads saying that smoking was good for you. I know ""they didn't know any better"" sounds like an excuse, but try to put yourself in their shoes."
Laetitia94,2019-10-27 01:17:18,f5cq6db,t3_dnkf4w,t1_f5cpxu2,But there were already a lot of animal rescue organisations in the 70s the whole ethical discussion already existed about willd animals kn circusses etc. So i dont think internet should get that much credit.
every-day_throw-away,2019-10-27 01:28:51,f5crehe,t3_dnkf4w,t3_dnkf4w,Lighten up. There is no reason to harbor anger for people that love you and did what is considered to be a normal grandparent activity. Especially since they are dead now. Put down the baggage. Move on. They obviously loved you.   It's like hating yourself for once eating meat. There is no reason for it. Unless you are some type of gold star vegan you have changed. In time they might have changed just like our society is now changing.
Laetitia94,2019-10-27 01:32:59,f5crt4t,t3_dnkf4w,t1_f5crehe,I care about animala enormously and i think abuse is disgusting. So no i can't lighten up. Would you say lighten up if someone had to watch child abuse?
every-day_throw-away,2019-10-27 05:43:04,f5dk1kx,t3_dnkf4w,t1_f5crt4t,Letting go does not make you less of animal lover. It's baggage that you can put down. Instead of being angry at dead people and things that happened in the past concentrate on the here and now.   These grandparents were good people. They don't deserve that.
newfountain22,2019-10-27 05:44:49,f5dka9w,t3_dnkf4w,t3_dnkf4w,"I honestly feel bad for you, you’re holding onto this kind of anger with you even after your grandparents died. They didn’t know any better, information about how awful circuses were wasn’t readily available at that point. They were just trying to do something nice for you. Don’t let something this small ruin your perception of your grandparents, you can’t change the fact that you went to the circus; just use it as an example for what you won’t do when you’re raising kids/grandkids"
dogshitchantal,2019-10-27 05:53:53,f5dlhyw,t3_dnkf4w,t3_dnkf4w,"My mum took me to zoos as a kid. I loved it and neither of us realised how bad they are until later (we’re both vegan now).  My mum saw I had a love for animals and took me so I could learn more about different species. She did it out of love and encouragement and she didn’t know better.  I think you’re holding your grandparents up to an unattainable standard. Years ago people didn’t know that zoos were bad, the majority of people still don’t! They took you somewhere they thought you would enjoy, out of love.  I highly doubt they thought ‘let’s take our grandkid to this place that in-prisons animals’."
Liautenant,2019-10-27 06:12:14,f5dnx9l,t3_dnkf4w,t3_dnkf4w,"Being angry at dead people would not help animals in any way.  I understand your frustration, my grandparents taught me that going to circuses and zoos is fine, and I every time the circus was in town I wanted to go, up until I was 16, because I thought it was normal and good. But last time the circus was in town, I stood against them with protest signs, I was beaten by an employee too. And now, that circus is not allowed in my country anymore. Just imagine if I passed that day in my bed, holding on a hateful memory of dead people - I then wouldn’t have a neck bruise for two weeks, and a bad memory of the circus bitch that hit me, but their violence would not been in full display for everyone to see.  You can think the worse of your grandparents, that’s okay, but then do something for the animals, something real, not just writing about how awful people are. Veganism is about love, not hate."
Watsonmolly,2019-10-27 06:49:25,f5dsr4t,t3_dnkf4w,t3_dnkf4w,"This is doing no good whatsoever, you’re just causing yourself stress by dwelling on this."
Inasaba,2019-10-27 07:46:50,f5dztp8,t3_dnkf4w,t3_dnkf4w,You might like /r/VeganForCirclejerkers better than this sub.
Laetitia94,2019-10-27 09:49:32,f5efdwf,t3_dnkf4w,t1_f5dnx9l,Well i tbink that js a bit harsh to say that it is no point in being angry but i should do sometjing practical. My point is that it that my veganism or activism has nothing to do with my anger towards my grandparents. Whether i am doing something or not. That anger is still there. It is not rational it is an emotional response.
lostriders,2019-10-27 13:09:09,f5fev59,t3_dnkf4w,t3_dnkf4w,They didn’t know any better. I can look back and think the same things. We are now equipped with knowledge and we will all change the world for the better.
okcafe,2019-10-27 16:42:21,f5glgbu,t3_dnkf4w,t3_dnkf4w,"It’s pointless, my friend. It is likely they never were exposed to this discourse, so take it as a gesture of love. You are lucky to have even had grandparents who took you places, all of mine are dead."
Inasaba,2019-10-27 16:45:15,f5glux0,t3_dnkf4w,t1_f5glmi3,"People are allowed to be angsty about their past. I totally get that the grandparents didn't know better, but it doesn't mean that we can't *wish* that the past had been different. No need to be so rude."
okcafe,2019-10-27 16:45:18,f5glv5l,t3_dnkf4w,t1_f5fev59,"Exactly, well put. It was likely something they viewed generationally as an expression of love, a fun day out. Sure, we now know it is wrong to hold animals in places where they would not naturally be. Yes, circuses and zoos abuse animals. Yes, it is wrong. But did you grandparents play a direct role in that abuse? Not really; they were unaware of the indirect role they played in supporting the industry, however. Ignorance does not equate to evil in all cases. You should consider an outside perspective, OP."
okcafe,2019-10-27 16:46:44,f5gm260,t3_dnkf4w,t1_f5glux0,"I agree, an apologize. It’s just very deeply emotional and the grandparents ignorance did not equate to evil, it seems like a perspective that is far too subjective for this sub, in my opinion."
OstrichCake,2019-10-27 18:02:02,f5h14i1,t3_dnkf4w,t1_f5gmzb6,They wrote “u fortunately” which is a common typo on phones when writing “unfortunately.”
Laetitia94,2019-10-27 18:13:05,f5h3g6d,t3_dnkf4w,t1_f5gmzb6,I meant unfortunately.
plantbasedface,2019-10-27 19:05:52,f5hcaz6,t3_dnkf4w,t3_dnkf4w,This is honestly ridiculous. I think it’s safe to say the vast majority of us have been to the zoo with our parents or school when we were younger. It’s not something you should hold resentment for. Instead focus that energy on making change because this is petty.
Laetitia94,2019-10-27 19:19:50,f5hfoyr,t3_dnkf4w,t1_f5hcaz6,I don't think it is your place to say which emotions someone has are ridiculous and which aren't.
Laetitia94,2019-10-28 02:24:12,f5jifca,t3_dnkf4w,t1_f5glgbu,Well i alsp was that lucky to be abused in my childhood.
Arceye,2019-10-28 20:18:13,f5mutfj,t3_dnkf4w,t1_f5crt4t,"There was a time once when kids were married off before puberty. I don't hate my ancestors because at some point one of them married a 12 year old, and I don't see them as child abusers.  Different times had different cultural norms and a different understanding of the world. It's not fair to judge the past with the knowledge we have today. Hindsight is 20/20.  I'm sure in 50 years we'll figure something out and your grandkids will be judging you for it."
Laetitia94,2019-10-28 20:25:57,f5mwj8r,t3_dnkf4w,t1_f5mutfj,Well marrying a 12 yr old is child abuse and i would hope you see that too. The fact that a culture say it is not doens't make it any less of abuse   By the way in times of slavery there were a lot op people againet it.  The point with child marriages is is not only a culture hut often religion as well. And you van easily change a religion. So you cant really compare that.
Laetitia94,2019-10-30 09:28:39,f5sfkcq,t3_dnkf4w,t1_f5rzxan,Lol as if emotions are that rational.
Laetitia94,2019-10-30 09:33:15,f5sfqm6,t3_dnkf4w,t1_f5sfmhj,Well age doesnt have anything to do with ir. I was in psychotherapy for a few years and the first thing you learn is not too judge your emotions because they are not logic or rational.  But never mind.
Laetitia94,2019-10-30 10:25:11,f5shsgi,t3_dnkf4w,t1_f5sfwzq,On the one hand no because they didnt know any better and of course did it out of love for me and my sister.   On the other hand yes because they were the adults and should know better. It is everbodys responsibility to be critical in life and to be informed  it is not super hard.
Laetitia94,2019-10-30 10:34:58,f5si7kd,t3_dnkf4w,t1_f5si5aw,What it is your point then with this comparison?
Laetitia94,2019-10-30 10:41:06,f5sihaw,t3_dnkf4w,t1_f5sidyr,So actually you wanted to.point out that that i am silly to be angry over this because there are way worse things that can happen to you like in your situation.
Laetitia94,2019-10-30 10:52:44,f5sj0o5,t3_dnkf4w,t1_f5siww7,Well i dont think it is silly
Laetitia94,2019-10-30 11:04:36,f5sjlai,t3_dnkf4w,t1_f5siww7,I said it is not hard to get informed.  And if you think what i say is crap then i  think we are done talking.
Laetitia94,2019-10-30 11:11:20,f5sjxcq,t3_dnkf4w,t1_f5sjv7s,Perhaps i have a zero tolerance for stupidity.
Laetitia94,2019-10-30 11:21:53,f5skgpc,t3_dnkf4w,t1_f5sk35x,Stupidity to not be informed about the fact that a circus is animall abuse. Even if you wouldnt know the facts of how these animals are trained by torture it is still common sense fhat it is not the natural behaviour of animals. And wild animals cant be forced unless you use violence.  Stupidity is just doing things because culture says it is normal and taught you this to do it. By not asking questions and being critical anout everyhing you do. Stupidity is not getting informed by being critical and askings questions and to teach your children what you have been taught
Laetitia94,2019-10-30 12:07:15,f5sn0j7,t3_dnkf4w,t1_f5sk35x,Also i saw at yout profile that you are not vegan. So perhaps you are not in the best position to comment.
court0f0wls,2019-11-20 14:02:35,f84r4fd,t3_dnkf4w,t3_dnkf4w,I’d try to get over it. It’s likely they did it for good reason and just didn’t know any better

From the standpoint of politics, and the fact that Wyoming probably has a great deal of ranch land, a large population of vegans could really do some damage. Over just a few years we could start drastically affecting local and state laws, right? And then as a largely vegan state, we’d be a paragon for other states, perhaps Wyoming could do for veganism what California did for marijuana because of the low population density?

I went to a coffee shop for breakfast when my husband was in the hospital and had to walk back out with no food. Literally nothing was vegan. NOTHING. Only black coffee. THAT WAS IT. Even the freaking TOAST was made with milk and egg. I managed to snag an apple in the hospital gift shop. This is crazy.

A freakin’ salad with actual greens and not iceberg shit.   There’s a vegetarian grocery store here, which is good. And the have a hot/cold food bar as well as a salad bar. Just gotta avoid offerings with cheese and dairy. Fortunately the ingredients are displayed. But to just get a quick snack somewhere... Take airports for example. The only thing I find there are fruit salad cups (with grapes so I avoid them...conventional may have too many pesticides, I just don’t know) and these half rancid nut mixtures. Oh they say good until a year from now but every time I’ve bought one they have tasted semi-rancid. And once you’re in the plane it isn’t like you can go back and complain. Maybe I’m being a bit unfair. They aren’t all rancid. It’s hit and miss. Out of the few terminals I’ve been to, San Francisco seemed to have some not too bad stuff but it’s been a long time. May have been before going vegan a few years ago though. Prior to that I’ve been vegetarian for most of my adult life.   Buying an apple from the gift shop. Not even the cafeteria. That’s sad."

I was a vegetarian a long time before I dropped the dairy and eggs. Even as a vegetarian I learned a lot of things over time. Like how rennet is used in most cheeses. It’s an enzyme from a cow’s stomach.  Once I discovered that I was careful about which cheeses to buy. And it just developed from there.   The idea is, get people started. I know it isn’t perfect. In an ideal world everyone would become vegan when you lay out the information. But most human beings don’t work that way. In fact there are plenty who aren’t bothered by the fact a sentient being is slaughtered for their burger or steak. Sad but true. But maybe if you can convince those types that a plant based diet is healthier that would be a better option.   In other words, lead with the positives rather than the negatives."

QuantumHope,2019-12-05 04:11:54,f9p1mdw,t3_e1lw98,t1_f9nnqpv,"As a vegan I can tell ya not everyone is so negative in tone.   If you have a dairy allergy, for milk on cereal I highly recommend unsweetened cashew milk. I like it MUCH better than almond, oat, or hemp milk. Coconut milk isn’t too bad either. Probably the richest one is soy milk but I have a soy sensitivity so... But if you have no soy issues that might be the way to go. Other non-dairy milks are much thinner than cow’s milk.   Now I suck at the culinary arts so I couldn’t tell you which one is best for baking and such as a substitute.   There are soy based ice creams. I have never tried those though due to the aforementioned sensitivity but I know the coconut ice creams are quite tasty depending on the brand and  flavouring.   I don’t know if this is available on the mainland but Hawaiian Sun makes this frozen “coconut milk” that when thawed is like a sweet yogurt.  OMG! I mixed in fresh blueberries and it was awesome!!! If you don’t like the taste of coconut then you wouldn’t like this stuff because there is a distinct coconut flavour to it. https://www.hawaiiansunproducts.com/coconut/   I think that sums it up."

janni518,2019-12-05 20:05:09,f9rh9rm,t3_e1lw98,t3_e1lw98,"I also lived on a farm, a dairy farm to be exact.  I married into the life at the age of 18 in the 70s. We were only a small farm and had only around 40 Holstein and Guernsey milking cows at any given time. I think they tried to give the cows a decent quality of life, but it's what started me on the path to veganism.   The cows used to mostly give birth spring and summer out in the fields (they were bred that way)and they would try to hide their babies. That's because after a day, the babies were taken away and would be raised by hand. Females were kept to become part of the herd, but the poor males went off in the butchers truck. The first time I saw it, I couldn't eat for days (I was pregnant so everyone was freaking out) and I refused to eat any of the meat, ever again. I don't particularly like cows but I was just heartbroken. I learned to never name any of them.I did what I could to make some positive changes for them, but my in-laws (ex now) were Austrian immigrants and my Ukranian wasn't great -I've since forgotten it.) They all had farms nearby and they all thought I was crazy. The poor things got locked up all winter in stanchions that allowed some movement but not enough. In the spring when they'd get released they were so happy.  When the health department and other inspectors came around, they were much more interested in testing our tanks and checking out the cleanliness of our mailing machines, than the welfare of if the animals.  Did they mind being milked? No, because when it is time to be milked or nurse your baby it starts to hurt if that doesn't happen. It's really painful.  We just opened the barn door and yelled for them and they came right in most of the time."

Even the papers cited by the article you gave me admit that to grow cells they use expansion media that are derived partially from animals (ref.4)! 2. OOC (organs on a chip) have the same problem.

Toxicology tests for household products was banned in 2015 in the U.K., but not for other products.  In the absence of a concerted scientific approach towards an ethical alternative, there can be no defence for this animal exploitation.

Additionally, proponents of this approach argue that testing would favour a conservative approach if humans were the subjects.  2. I’ve read that list and I know it is by no means exhaustive. The deceit is that those drugs were developed by a variety of other means, and their successful development does not disprove the efficacy of alternative testing methods - it only proves that they were not used in the case of these drugs. These drugs may have also been developed with a combination of in vitro testing, organoid testing and human testing. Additionally, there are many drugs which were once thought to be lethal to humans because of misleading findings from animal research, such as penicillin. It’s worth remembering our most common drugs were discovered accidentally without animal use in development, like ibuprofen and paracetamol."
lostcosmos,2020-05-11 21:14:20,fqb6ybl,t3_ghloxx,t1_fqb1ehj,"1. It's a big business. People do a lot for money.  2. They do not need to use animal derived chemicals. Maybe just a couple of years ago that was a valid argument but today even complicated proteins are available on the open market for a lot cheaper and better. With your HeLa example the major, and probably the most structually complicated component of FBS is the Bovine Serum Albumin. In the HeLa space the BSA is a substitute for human albumin. It would be way better to use human albumin but cost was always a factor. Human albumin, from a human, is listed on Sigma Aldrich for [$124,000/g](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/srp6182?lang=en&amp;region=US). Human albumin, from rice, is only [$104/g](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/a9731?lang=en&amp;region=US).  3. There was no vaccine studied in the referenced paper. The referenced paper just documents the SARS-COVID-2 infection in monkeys and doesn't even relate it to the relatively massive amount of human data already available."

As others have pointed out, just because it is safe and effective in one species does not mean it is safe and effective in another. Theralizumab was also tested on monkeys. There's a great BBC doc on the human trial that went south.  Albumin is not a singular protein. Albumin is more of a class of proteins. Human and bovine albumin are different. Bovine albumin has double the tryptophan binding sites as human albumin. Yes, FBS has bovine growth factors. It would be better to use human growth factors (that can be produced recombinantly). Again not equal, but better."

FBS is easier and cheaper to extract. I agree theoretically better but practically much worse. Better to do experiments with something quite close to humans than no experiments at all.   Bovine and human albumin are extremely similar functionally, structurally and in peptide sequence. That's why human cells can grow in a medium with albumin in it.   All these are besides the point. Basic research is definitely based on so much animal products that just abolishing their use would render research non-feasible.   I will take the point that in animals and humans differ and some drugs can be harmful to animals but not to humans. However, I don't think this is the rule especially as we get closer genetically."

JDSweetBeat,2020-05-12 02:08:39,fqc3fv9,t3_ghloxx,t1_fqc2bgi,"1. Fair enough. And it depends on what you mean by ""enhances life quality."" It's generally known that eating meat enhances life quality (in that it provides the individual who eats meat pleasure), and yet most vegans would argue that inflicting immense suffering on somebody else in order increase your own pleasure is the height of immorality. In other words, prioritizing the sexual pleasure of human males with erectile dysfunction over the immense suffering inflicted on lab animals is extremely immoral, no matter how much pleasure the human males receive from the act.  2. I'm unaware of any alternatives to animal testing. Why shouldn't we perform human testing on consenting humans, instead of imprisoning animals and torturing them against their will?"
TedBioChem,2020-05-12 02:16:36,fqc48zd,t3_ghloxx,t1_fqc3fv9,"""Enhances quality of life"" was meant that taking a drug makes your life less painful and you can cope easier with a chronic disease.   I had a discussion with someone else on this post about alternatives, you can read and find out (briefly: organoids and chipped tissues! intriguing stuff). Briefly: there is nothing at that level yet.  Consenting humans are part for the rest of the clinical trial. Testing if a new chemical is efficacious and toxic is first done on animals in pre-clinical studies. Most animals, to my knowledge, are not taken from the wild (I assume that's what you mean by imprison?) but bred for animal studies. Other animal conveniences: easier to work with, faster life cycles (in the case of even smaller animals or animals in basic research), genetically easy to manipulate compared to humans."

That is, if you could cure human blindness in 99% of cases, and all it took was for you to experiment on a few human children in an extremely painful manner, would that be moral? And if you would indeed apply at logic consistently, how are you any different from the Soviet, Japanese, and Nazi scientists who were perfectly happy harming other humans for what they perceived as the greater good?  And why can't you test the efficacy and toxicity of drugs on consenting humans? It's not going to be terribly hard to find willing test subjects -- just financially incentivize it. At least here the individuals being tested on are consenting and aware of the danger.  What I mean by ""imprison"" is ""lock in a cage against their will."" In other words, if you lock a rabbit in a cage for most of its life, it is imprisoned.  Animals are also pretty inconvenient because the results of drugs in animals are more often than not different from the results of those same drugs in humans."

As for your blindness question: that is a quite stretched hypothetical. Practically you can study the eyes of animals. You can never know with certainty that you can cure anything unproven in science with a 99% success rate. If we had such foresight I don't think we will kill animals at such a high rate. But theoretically, if we could do that in another universe... I don't know. This is a more philosophical question...  Imprisonment is bad. I am not sure if rodents are aware of it though. Primates are for sure. That is a good point the argument is: is that worth abandoning research over? Instinctively, I would say no.   To your last point, that is partly true. However, that is not entirely due to animals being genetically or anatomically dissimilar. It has mostly to do with study design, statistical analysis and thorough peer review."

If your problem is animals not consenting to being treated with drugs why is forcing humans, even if they are criminals?

I don’t see why experimental medicine shouldn’t just be tested on consenting humans, animal testing doesn’t offer much information that reliably applies to humans anyway.  idk why you’re trawling through months old threads just to bring up examples any vegan’s fuckwit uncle has already pestered them about a million times. It’s sad. Go away."
